Enumeration

# NFCWindowSceneEvent

An NFC-related event that your app uses to update its user interface.

enum NFCWindowSceneEvent
```

## Overview

When the device is eligible to receive NFC-related events, this type indicates the type of received event. The event may indicate the presence of an NFC reader or a gesture by the person using the app to initiate a contactless transaction. NFCWindowSceneEvent represents these as the NFCWindowSceneEvent.readerDetected and NFCWindowSceneEvent.presentation cases, respectively.

You can receive this event in two scenarios:

- When the system calls UISceneDelegate method scene(_:willConnectTo:options:), the system created a new scene in response to the event. In this case, check the `connectionOptions` parameter for the presence of the nfcEvent member, which is an instance of NFCWindowSceneEvent.

- When the system calls the NFCWindowSceneDelegate method windowScene(_:didReceiveNFCWindowSceneEvent:), the system delivered the event to an existing scene.

In either case, store the event and use it to update the UI for an NFC interaction. The following example shows a scene delegate that handles both scenarios, using a `ViewModel` class to store the event for use by an appropriate view:

```
import UIKit
import SwiftUI
import CoreNFC

class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate, NFCWindowSceneDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?
    var myViewModel = ViewModel()

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
        guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }

        // Check the connection options to see if the scene is being created
        // in response to an NFC event.
        guard let nfcEvent = connectionOptions.nfcEvent  else { return }
        // If there's an event, update the view model.
        myViewModel.receivedNFCEvent = nfcEvent

        // Update the view hierarchy by using myViewModel to create a new
        // view.
    }

    func windowScene(_ windowScene: UIWindowScene, didReceiveNFCWindowSceneEvent event: NFCWindowSceneEvent) {
        // Update the view model with the NFC event.
        myViewModel.receivedNFCEvent = event
        // Update the view hierarchy by using myViewModel to create a new
        // view.
     }
}
```
