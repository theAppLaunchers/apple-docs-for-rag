## Discussion

This stream is provided for you automatically by the session object but you must configure it if you want to receive any associated stream events. You do this by assigning a delegate object to the stream that implements the stream(_:handle:) delegate method. You must then schedule the stream in a run loop so that it can receive data asynchronously from one of your applicationâ€™s threads.

For information on how to schedule an input stream in a run loop and use it to receive data, see Stream Programming Guide.
