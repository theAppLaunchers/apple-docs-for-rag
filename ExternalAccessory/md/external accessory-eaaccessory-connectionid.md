## Discussion

The connection ID uniquely identifies this accessory to the device. If multiple accessories of the same type are connected to the device, you can use this information to distinguish between them.

The connection ID for an accessory persists only for the duration of the current connection. If the accessory is disconnected and reconnected, a new connection ID is assigned.
