``` source
static var deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometricsOrCompanion: LAPolicy { get }
```

## Discussion

Companion or biometric authentication is required. If no nearby paired companion device can be found, it behaves as LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics. Similarly, if biometry is unavailable it behaves as LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithCompanion.

```
        When both mechanisms are available, user is asked to use biometry and companion authentication
        will run in parallel. Users should follow instructions on the companion device to authenticate.
