## Discussion

This property is overwritten if an authentication reason is provided in evaluatePolicy(_:localizedReason:reply:).

The localized string you present to the user should provide a clear reason for why you are requesting they authenticate themselves, and what action you will be taking based on that authentication. This string should be provided in the userâ€™s current language and should be short and clear. It should not contain the app name, because that appears elsewhere in the authentication dialog. In macOS this appears in the dialog title, and in iOS this appears in the dialog subtitle.
