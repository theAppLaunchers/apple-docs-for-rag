A key that describes the type of user action that leads to the ad impression. The value is `"click_to_App_Store"`.

`source_nonce`

`string`

## Discussion

The device generates the AdImpressionRequest and sends it in the body of a Get a Signed Web Ad Impression Payload request. The device uses the value from the `attributionSourceNonce` in a web ad link for the `source_nonce` value in this request. The ad network looks up the fully signed web ad impression using the `source_nonce` value, which it creates when it serves the attributable ad link.

Important

The `attributionSourceNonce` in a web ad, the `source_nonce` in this request, and the `nonce` in a corresponding AdImpressionResponse all represent the same UUID, but the encoding varies.
