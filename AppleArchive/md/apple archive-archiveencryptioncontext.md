## Topics

### Creating an archive encryption context

init?(from: ArchiveByteStream)

Returns a new encryption context from the specified encrypted stream.

init(profile: ArchiveEncryptionContext.Profile, compressionAlgorithm: ArchiveCompression, compressionBlockSize: Int)

Returns a new encryption context from the specified profile, compression algorithm, and block size.

### Setting and retrieving keys

var mainKey: SymmetricKey?

The main key used to append data to an existing archive.

var symmetricKey: SymmetricKey?

The symmetric encryption key used to encrypt or decrypt an archive.

func generateSymmetricKey() throws -> SymmetricKey

Generates a symmetric encryption key.

func setSymmetricKey(SymmetricKey) throws

Sets the symmetric encryption key that the context requires for symmetric encryption mode.

func setRecipientPrivateKey(P256.KeyAgreement.PrivateKey) throws

Sets the recipient private key that the context requires to decrypt an archive to a specific recipient in ECDHE encryption profiles.

func setSigningPrivateKey(P256.Signing.PrivateKey) throws

Sets the signing private key that corresponds to the signing public key that you used to create the archive.

func setRecipientPublicKey(P256.KeyAgreement.PublicKey) throws

Sets the recipient public key that the context requires to encrypt an archive to a specific recipient in ECDHE encryption profiles.

func setSigningPublicKey(P256.Signing.PublicKey) throws

Sets the signing public key that the context requires to unlock a signed archive.

### Signing an encryption context

static func sign(encryptedStream: ArchiveByteStream, encryptionContext: ArchiveEncryptionContext) throws

Signs an encrypted archive using the credentials stored in the specified encryption context.

var signatureMode: ArchiveEncryptionContext.SignatureMode

The signature mode, such as an ECDSA Nist P-256 signature.

struct SignatureMode

Constants that describe the signature modes of an encryption context.

### Getting and setting encryption context properties

func decryptAttributes() -> Bool

Validates decryption keys, collects archive attributes, and updates the context with decrypted archive attributes.

var archiveIdentifier: Data?

An optional set of data that represents the archive identifier.

var authData: Data?

An optional, unencrypted set of data thatâ€™s stored in the archive prologue.

var checksumMode: ArchiveEncryptionContext.ChecksumMode

The checksum mode, such as the 256-bit SHA-256 checksum.

struct ChecksumMode

Constants that describe the checksum modes of an encryption context.

var containerSize: Int

The size of the compressed and encrypted archive.

var encryptionMode: ArchiveEncryptionContext.EncryptionMode

The encryption mode, such as symmetric key encryption.

struct EncryptionMode

Constants that describe the checksum modes of an encryption context.

var compressionAlgorithm: ArchiveCompression

The compression algorithm, such as LZFSE.

struct ArchiveCompression

Constants that describe compression algorithms.

var compressionBlockSize: Int

The compression block size that defines the size of the blocks, in bytes, that the context splits data into.

var paddingSize: Int

An integer value that, if not zero, specifies that the size of the final archive is a multiple of the padding size.

var profile: ArchiveEncryptionContext.Profile

The profile of the archve.

struct Profile

Constants that describe the profile of an encryption context.

var rawSize: Int

The size of the archive raw data.

var signatureEncryptionKey: SymmetricKey?

The signature encryption key that the context requires to sign an encrypted archive.

### Setting a password

var password: String?

The password used to encrypt or decrypt an archive.

func generatePassword() throws -> String

Generates a new password.

func setPassword(String) throws

Sets the password from the supplied string.
