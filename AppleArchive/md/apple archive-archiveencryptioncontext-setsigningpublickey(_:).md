``` source
func setSigningPublicKey(_ key: P256.Signing.PublicKey) throws
```

## Parameters 

`key`  

The recipient public key.

## Discussion

The public signing key is necessary to unlock a signed archive. If you donâ€™t provide a private key when you create a new archive, provide a public key to tie the encryption to the signing identity. In this case, you need to sign the archive offline using the corresponding signing private key.
