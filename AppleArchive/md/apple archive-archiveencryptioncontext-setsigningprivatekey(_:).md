``` source
func setSigningPrivateKey(_ key: P256.Signing.PrivateKey) throws
```

## Parameters 

`key`  

The signing private key.

## Discussion

If you set this on an encryption stream, you donâ€™t need to set the corresponding public key because Apple Archive derives the public key from the private key.

If you only provide a signing public key to the encryption stream, sign the archive with a private key after closing the stream. Use a private key that corresponds to the signing public key that you used to create the archive.
