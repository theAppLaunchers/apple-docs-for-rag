## Topics

### Profile Constants

static let hkdf_sha256_hmac__none__ecdsa_p256: ArchiveEncryptionContext.Profile

A constant that represents no encryption, authenticated container, signature is mandatory.

static let hkdf_sha256_aesctr_hmac__symmetric__none: ArchiveEncryptionContext.Profile

A constant that represents unsigned, symmetric key encryption.

static let hkdf_sha256_aesctr_hmac__symmetric__ecdsa_p256: ArchiveEncryptionContext.Profile

A constant that represents signed symmetric key encryption, signed with encrypted signature.

static let hkdf_sha256_aesctr_hmac__ecdhe_p256__none: ArchiveEncryptionContext.Profile

A constant that represents unsigned ECDHE public key encryption, where only the recipient with the corresponding private key can unlock the container.

static let hkdf_sha256_aesctr_hmac__ecdhe_p256__ecdsa_p256: ArchiveEncryptionContext.Profile

A constant that represents signed ECDHE public key encryption, where only the recipient with the corresponding private key can unlock the container.

static let hkdf_sha256_aesctr_hmac__scrypt__none: ArchiveEncryptionContext.Profile

A constant that represents unsigned password encryption using scrypt.
