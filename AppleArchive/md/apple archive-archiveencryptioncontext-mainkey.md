## Discussion

Use the main key to append data to an existing AEA archive with the encryptionStream(appendingTo:encryptionContext:flags:threadCount:) function.

You can use the original credentials for symmetric key or password encryption. You need this key to reopen archives created with the ECDHE profiles.

The main key canâ€™t be used to open the stream for decryption.
