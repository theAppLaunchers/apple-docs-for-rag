## Discussion

To support search continuation, be sure to include the `CoreSpotlightContinuation` key in your Info.plist file with the value `true`. When users continue a query they started in Spotlight, the system calls your app delegateâ€™s `application(_:willContinueUserActivityWithType:)` method with `CSQueryContinuationActionType`. Then, your app delegate receives an NSUserActivity object that contains a `userInfo` dictionary that includes the CSSearchQueryString key in its `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)` method. You use the query string associated with this key to continue the search.
