## Discussion

A `CSUserQuery/Responses-struct` structure contains the results of a query. Fetch this structure from the responses property of your query object to execute the query automatically and begin the delivery of the results. Each element that this structure returns to you is either a search result or a suggested completion of the current search text. Check the element type and handle it accordingly.

For more information about how to use this structure, see the responses property.
