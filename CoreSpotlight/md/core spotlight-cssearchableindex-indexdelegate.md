## Discussion

The delegate should conform to the CSSearchableIndexDelegate protocol. Set this property to handle communication with the index and perform index-management tasks for your app. In particular, long-running apps should set a delegate so that the index can be updated while the app is in the background. Alternatively, you can create an extension with a request handler that conforms to the CSSearchableIndexDelegate protocol and let the extension perform index updates when your app isnâ€™t running.
