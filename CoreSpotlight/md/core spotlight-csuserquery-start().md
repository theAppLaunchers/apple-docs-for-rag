## Discussion

This method uses the configured search parameters and query string to begin a search of the index. It then delivers the results of that search to the closures in the foundItemsHandler, foundSuggestionsHandler, and completionHandler properties of the query object.

Note

Donâ€™t call this method if you fetch the query results using the responses property. Accessing that property automatically starts the query.
