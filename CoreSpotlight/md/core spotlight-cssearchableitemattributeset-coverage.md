## Discussion

The string values in this property typically include a location (such as a place name or geographic coordinates), a temporal period (such as a period label, date, or date range), or a jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity).

Itâ€™s recommended that you select a value from a controlled vocabulary, and that when you need to specify a place or time period, you use a name instead of a numeric identifier, such as a set of coordinates or a date range.
