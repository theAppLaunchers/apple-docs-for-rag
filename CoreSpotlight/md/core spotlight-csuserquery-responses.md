## Discussion

Getting the value of this property starts the query and begins the delivery of responses. Typically, you get this property as part of a `for..in` loop to iterate over the responses, as shown in the following example:

```
var results: [CSUserQuery.Item] = []
var suggestions: [CSUserQuery.Suggestion] = []
let query = CSUserQuery(userQueryString: searchText, userQueryContext: queryContext)

for try await element in query.responses {
    switch(element) {
        case .item(let item):
            self.results.append(item)
            break
        case .suggestion(let suggestion):
            self.suggestions.append(suggestion)
            break
        @unknown default:
            break
    }
}
```
