Searching for information in your app

## Discussion

This method uses the configured search parameters and query string to begin a search of the index. It then delivers the results of that search to the closures in the foundItemsHandler and completionHandler properties of the query object.

Note

Donâ€™t call this method if you fetch the query results using the results property. Accessing that property automatically starts the query.
