## Overview

Use the VSAccountManagerDelegate methods to aid in displaying and dismissing authentication view controllers.

If the user isnâ€™t authenticated when your app calls enqueue(_:completionHandler:) with isInterruptionAllowed set to true, the system sends an authentication view controller to the delegate in the accountManager(_:present:) method for your app to present to the user.
