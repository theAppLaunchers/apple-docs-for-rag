## Discussion

In a carousel inteface, the first of two buttons invites the user to play the content associated with the current item. The action object you assign to this property provides the title and image to use for that button. When selected, the system loads the actionâ€™s URL.

In a sectioned interface, tvOS loads the URL for the specified action when the current item is focused and the user presses the play/pause button.
