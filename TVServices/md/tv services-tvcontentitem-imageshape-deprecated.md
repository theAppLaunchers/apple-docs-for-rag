## Discussion

When the TV Content object is being used to represent Top Shelf items, then the allowed values for this property depend on the topShelfStyle property of the object that implements the TV TopShelf extension. For more information, see TVTopShelfProvider.

If the topShelfStyle value is TVTopShelfContentStyle.inset, the valid values of this property are:

- TVContentItemImageShape.extraWide

If the topShelfStyle value is TVTopShelfContentStyle.sectioned, the valid values are:

- TVContentItemImageShape.poster

- TVContentItemImageShape.square

- TVContentItemImageShape.HDTV

If the value of this property is not valid for the current Top Shelf style, the system reserves the right to scale the image in any way.
