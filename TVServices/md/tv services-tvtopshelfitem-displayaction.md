## Discussion

In a carousel inteface, the second of two buttons invites the user to display additional details for the current item. The action object you assign to this property provides the title and image to use for that button. When selected, the system loads the actionâ€™s URL.

In a sectioned or inset interface, tvOS loads the URL for the specified action when the user selects the current item.
