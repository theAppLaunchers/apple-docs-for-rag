## Discussion

If you specify a value for this property, the system initially displays the corresponding video instead of a static image. The video plays in a loop until the preview video loads and is ready to play. If you do not specify a value for this property, the system displays the image you set using the setImageURL(_:for:) method.

The system does not play any sound content present in the video, so there is no need to include it when creating your assets.
