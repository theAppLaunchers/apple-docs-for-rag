Instance Method

# createEventForDigitizerCollection

Creates a HID event object that represents a digitizer collection.

DriverKit 19.0+macOS

``` source
IOHIDEvent * createEventForDigitizerCollection(IOHIDDigitizerCollection * collection, uint64_t timestamp, uint32_t reportID);
```

## Parameters 

`collection`  

A collection of IOHIDElement objects, each of which contains digitizer information to include in the event object.

`timestamp`  

The timestamp of the input report.

`reportID`  

The report ID.

## Return Value

An `IOHIDEvent` object containing the digitizer-related data. This method returns `NULL` if it encounters an error or if no elements in the collection contain updated values.

## Discussion

This method creates an `IOHIDEvent` object with any updated digitizer values that it finds. The handleDigitizerReport calls this method when processing an input report; donâ€™t call this method directly.
