# CompleteInputReport

Processes the results of an asynchronous request for an input report.

void CompleteInputReport(OSAction * action, IOReturn status, uint32_t actualByteCount, uint64_t completionTimestamp);
```

## Parameters 

`action`  

The completion action.

`status`

`actualByteCount`

## Discussion

If an asynchronous request for an input report was successful, this method handles the report and schedules a new asynchronous request for an updated report. If the request was unsuccessful, this method retries the initial request, resetting the USB device as needed if it is unresponsive.
