Instance Method

# Stop

Stops the device service associated with the specified provider.

DriverKit 19.0+macOS

``` source
kern_return_t Stop(IOService * provider);
```

## Parameters 

`provider`  

The provider associated with the current service. This object is the same one that the system previously passed to your serviceâ€™s Start method.

## Return Value

kIOReturnSuccess on success, or another value if an error occurs. See Error Codes.

## Discussion

Before terminating the object in `provider`, the system calls this method to stop the service associated with that object. Use your implementation of this method to stop all activity and put your driver in a quiescent state. Call `super` at the end of your implementation. After you call `super`, it is a programmer error to access the `provider` object.
