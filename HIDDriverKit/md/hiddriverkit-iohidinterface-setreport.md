Instance Method

# SetReport

Sends a report to the HID device.

DriverKit 19.0+macOS

``` source
kern_return_t SetReport(IOMemoryDescriptor * report, IOHIDReportType reportType, uint32_t reportID, IOOptionBits options);
```

## Parameters 

`report`  

A memory descriptor that contains the report data that you want to send to the HID device.

`reportType`  

The type of report you want to send to the device.

`reportID`  

The unique identifier for the report.

`options`  

Options to specify when sending the report.

## Return Value

kIOReturnSuccess on success, or another value if an error occurs. See Error Codes.

## Discussion

This method sets the report by calling the setReport method of its associated IOHIDDevice object. When sending the report to the device, this method combines the `reportID` and `options` together, with the `reportID` occupying the lower 8 bits of a 32-bit integer, and the `options` occupying the upper 24 bits.
