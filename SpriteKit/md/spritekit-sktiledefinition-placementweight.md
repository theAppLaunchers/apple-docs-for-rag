## Discussion

This value is used to determine how likely this tile definition is to be chosen for placement when a SKTileGroupRule has multiple tile definitions assigned to it. A higher value relative to the other definitions assigned to the rule make it more likely for this definition to be selected; lower values make it less likely. Defaults to 1. When set to 0, the definition will never be chosen as long as there is at least one other definition with a placementWeight above 0.
