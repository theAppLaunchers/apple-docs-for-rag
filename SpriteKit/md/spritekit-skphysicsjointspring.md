## Mentioned in 

Getting Started with Spring Joints

## Overview

An SKPhysicsJointSpring object simulates connecting two physics bodies together with a spring. The farther the two objects move from each other, the more force is applied to bring the two bodies back together.

## Topics

### First Steps

Getting Started with Spring Joints

Connect two physics bodies with a spring joint.

### Creating a Spring Joint

class func joint(withBodyA: SKPhysicsBody, bodyB: SKPhysicsBody, anchorA: CGPoint, anchorB: CGPoint) -> SKPhysicsJointSpring

Creates a new spring joint.

### Configuring a Spring Joint

var damping: CGFloat

Defines how the springâ€™s motion should be damped due to the forces of friction.

var frequency: CGFloat

Defines the frequency or stiffness characteristics of the spring.
