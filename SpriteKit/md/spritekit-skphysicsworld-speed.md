## Discussion

The default value is `1.0`, which means the simulation runs at normal speed. A value other than the default changes the rate at which time passes in the physics simulation. For example, a speed value of `2.0` indicates that time in the physics simulation passes twice as fast as the sceneâ€™s simulation time. A value of `0.0` pauses the physics simulation.
