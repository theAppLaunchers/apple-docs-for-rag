``` source
class func resize(
    toHeight height: CGFloat,
    duration: TimeInterval
) -> SKAction
```

## Parameters 

`height`  

The new height of the sprite.

`duration`  

The duration of the animation.

## Return Value

A new action object.

## Discussion

This action can only be executed by an SKSpriteNode object. When the action executes, the sprite’s size property animates to its new value.

This action is not reversible; the reverse of this action has the same duration but does not change anything.
