``` source
class func customAction(
    withDuration duration: TimeInterval,
    actionBlock block: @escaping (SKNode, CGFloat) -> Void
) -> SKAction
```

## Parameters 

`duration`  

The duration of the action, in seconds.

`block`  

The block to run. The block takes the following parameters:

node  
The node on which the action is running.

elapsedTime  
The amount of time that has passed in the animation.

## Return Value

A new action object.

## Discussion

When the action executes, the block is called repeatedly until the actionâ€™s duration expires. The elapsed time is computed and passed to the block whenever the block is called.

This action is not reversible; the reverse action executes the same block.

The following Swift code shows how you can create a custom action to update an attribute of an SKShader attached to a sprite node.

```
let customAction = SKAction.customAction(withDuration: 2.0) {
    node, elapsedTime in

    if let node = node as? SKSpriteNode {
        node.setValue(SKAttributeValue(float: Float(elapsedTime)),
                                       forAttribute: "a_time")
    }
}
```
