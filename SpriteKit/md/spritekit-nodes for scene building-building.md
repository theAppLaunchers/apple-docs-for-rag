class SKReferenceNode

A node thatâ€™s defined in an archived `.sks` file.

### Nodes that Draw

Display images, shapes, particles, text, video, tiles, or even 3D content.

Maximizing Node Drawing Performance

Structure your nodes for maximum performance.

class SKSpriteNode

### Nodes for Environmental Effects

Provide environmental effects to your scene, such as audio, lighting, or areas with specific physics characteristics.

class SKAudioNode

A node that plays audio.

class SKLightNode

A node that lights surrounding nodes.

class SKFieldNode

A node that applies physics effects to nearby nodes.

### Nodes that Modify Drawing

Modify the rendering of child nodes by cropping, applying Core Image filters, or performing 3D transformations.

class SKEffectNode

A node that renders its children into a separate buffer, optionally applying an effect, before drawing the final result.
