Initializer

# init(ciFilter:duration:)

Creates a transition that uses a Core Image filter to perform the transition.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalystmacOStvOSvisionOS

``` source
init(
    ciFilter filter: CIFilter,
    duration sec: TimeInterval
)
```

## Parameters 

`filter`  

A Core Image filter.

`sec`  

The duration of the transition.

## Return Value

A new transition.

## Discussion

The filter used to perform the transition must a be filter that requires only two image parameters (`inputImage`, `inputTargetImage`) and generates a single image (`outputImage`). The transition automatically sets the filterâ€™s `inputImage`, `inputTargetImage`, and `inputTime` properties. You must set up any other filter properties before creating the transition.
