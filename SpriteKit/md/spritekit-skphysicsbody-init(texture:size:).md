Initializer

# init(texture:size:)

Creates a physics body from the contents of a texture.

iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 1.0+

``` source
init(
    texture: SKTexture,
    size: CGSize
)
```

## Parameters 

`texture`  

The texture to convert into a physics body.

`size`  

The size of the physics body to return.

## Return Value

A new volume-based physics body.

## Discussion

Use this method when your sprite has a shape that you want replicated in its physics body. The texture is scaled to the new size and then analyzed. A new physics body is created that includes all of the texels in the texture that have a nonzero alpha value. The shape of this body attempts to strike a good balance between performance and accuracy. For example, fine details may be ignored if keeping them would cause a significant performance penalty.
