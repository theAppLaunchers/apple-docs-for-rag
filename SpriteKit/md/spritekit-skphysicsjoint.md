## Mentioned in 

Getting Started with Physics

## Overview

An SKPhysicsJoint object connects two physics bodies so that they are simulated together by the physics world. You never instantiate objects of this class directly; instead, you instantiate one of the subclasses that defines the kind of joint you want to make.

## Topics

### Connecting Bodies with Joints

Connecting Bodies with Joints

Add joints to nodes in your scene.

### Disconnecting Bodies from Joints

Disconnecting Bodies from Joints

Disconnect joints from nodes in your scene.

### Accessing or Setting a Jointâ€™s Bodies

var bodyA: SKPhysicsBody

The first body connected by the joint.

var bodyB: SKPhysicsBody

The second body connected by the joint.

### Reading the Stress and Speed that Are Currently Applied to a Joint

var reactionForce: CGVector

The instantaneous reaction force, in newtons, currently being directed at the anchor point.

var reactionTorque: CGFloat

Instantaneous reaction torque, in newton-meters, currently being directed at the anchor point.
