## Discussion

The value must be a number between `0.0` and `1.0`, inclusive. The default value (`0.0`) indicates that the color property is ignored and that the labelâ€™s font color should be used unmodified. For values greater than `0.0`, the font color is blended with the blend color, with the maximum value of 1.0 determining that the font color is 100% of the blend color.
