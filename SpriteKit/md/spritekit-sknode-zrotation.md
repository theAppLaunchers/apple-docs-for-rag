## Discussion

The default value is `0.0`, which indicates no rotation. A positive value indicates a counterclockwise rotation. When the coordinate system is rotated, it affects the node and its descendants. The rotation affects the nodeâ€™s frame property, hit testing, rendering, and other similar characteristics.
