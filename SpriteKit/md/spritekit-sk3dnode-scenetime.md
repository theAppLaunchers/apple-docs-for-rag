## Discussion

This timestamp determines the behavior of running animations, similar to how the playhead time in a video player application determines which frame of a movie to display. It applies only to animations whose usesSceneTimeBase property is true, including those loaded from a scene source using the playUsingSceneTimeBase option.

Use this property together with the above animation options when you want to directly control (or allow the user to directly control) the playback of animations.
