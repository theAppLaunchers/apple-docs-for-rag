# Creating a New Node By Rendering To a Texture

Render a portion of the node tree into a new texture.

## Overview

You can create a texture from some portion of on-screen content with texture(from:), or its variation, texture(from:crop:). Both of these functions are available for scenes rendered by SKView or WKInterfaceSKScene.

There are a couple reasons you might want to do this, for example:

- Creating a new sprite node whose texture reflects prior shading done with SKShader

- Flattening a hierarchy of nodes into a texture, either for performance, or to apply some effect. Note that this can also be done using SKEffectNode and setting shouldRasterize to true.

- Breaking appart an existing node into separate nodes, for example, for an explosion effect.
