## Mentioned in 

Lighting a Sprite with Light Nodes

## Discussion

To determine whether this sprite is affected by being a shadow generated by a light, its shadowCastBitMask property is tested against the lightâ€™s categoryBitMask property by performing a logical AND operation. If the comparison results in a nonzero value, the sprite is drawn using a shadowed effect.

The default value is 0x00000000 (all bits cleared).
