``` source
class func fadeOut(withDuration duration: TimeInterval) -> SKAction
```

## Parameters 

`duration`  

The duration of the animation.

## Return Value

A new action object.

## Mentioned in 

Getting Started with Actions

## Discussion

When the action executes, the nodeâ€™s alpha property animates from its current value to `0.0`. This causes the node to disappear.

This action is reversible; the reverse is created as if the following code is executed:

- Swift
- Obj-C

```
let action = SKAction.fadeIn(withDuration: sec)
```

```
[SKAction fadeInWithDuration: sec];
```
