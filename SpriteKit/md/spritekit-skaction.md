## Overview

SKAction is an animation that is executed by a node in the scene. Actions are used to change a node in some way (like move its position over time), but you can also use actions to change the scene, like doing a fadeout. When the scene processes its nodes, the actions associated with those nodes are processed.

## Topics

### First Steps

Getting Started with Actions

Create, configure, and run actions in SpriteKit.

Action Initializers

Use these functions to create actions.

### Controlling Action Timing

Configuring Action Timing

Time an action in a scene, by adding or modifying timing properties, or cancel an action.

var duration: TimeInterval

The duration required to complete an action.

var timingMode: SKActionTimingMode

A setting that controls the speed curve of an animation.

enum SKActionTimingMode

The modes that an action can use to adjust the apparent timing of the action.

var timingFunction: SKActionTimingFunction

A block used to customize the timing function.

typealias SKActionTimingFunction

The signature for the custom timing block.

var speed: CGFloat

A speed factor that modifies how fast an action runs.

### Using Action Names

Controlling Actions Precisely by Using Names

Set an actionâ€™s name property so you can access it later without needing an instance variable.

### Observing Live Changes

Detecting Changes at Each Step of an Animation

Get notified of a property change on your node subclass and retrieve the amount of change.
