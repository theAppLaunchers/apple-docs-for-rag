``` source
class func perform(
    _ selector: Selector,
    onTarget target: Any
) -> SKAction
```

## Parameters 

`selector`  

The selector of the method to call.

`target`  

The target object.

## Return Value

A new action object.

## Discussion

The action object maintains a strong reference to the target object.

When the action executes, the target objectâ€™s method is called. This action occurs instantaneously.

This action is not reversible; the reverse of this action calls the selector again.
