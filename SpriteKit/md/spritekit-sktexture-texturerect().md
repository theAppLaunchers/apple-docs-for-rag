func textureRect() -> CGRect
```

## Return Value

A rectangle in the unit coordinate space.

## Discussion

The default value is a rectangle that covers the entire texture `(0,0)` - `(1,1)`. You cannot set this value directly; to use only a portion of a texture, use the init(rect:in:) method to create a new texture.
