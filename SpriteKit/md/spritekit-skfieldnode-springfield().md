Type Method

# springField()

Creates a field node that applies a spring-like force that pulls physics bodies toward the field node.

**iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS**

``` source
@MainActor
class func springField() -> SKFieldNode
```

**watchOS**

``` source
class func springField() -> SKFieldNode
```

## Return Value

A new spring field node.

## Discussion

The strength of the field measures the strength of the spring. A positive number indicates that the body is accelerating toward the field node. The falloff property of a spring field node is set by default to `-1`.
