``` source
func applyImpulse(
    _ impulse: CGVector,
    at point: CGPoint
)
```

## Parameters 

`impulse`  

A vector that describes how much momentum to impart to the body. The impulse is measured in Newton-seconds.

`point`  

A point in scene coordinates that defines where the impulse was applied to the physics body.

## Discussion

Because this impulse is applied to a specific point on the object, it may change both the bodyâ€™s velocity and angular velocity.
