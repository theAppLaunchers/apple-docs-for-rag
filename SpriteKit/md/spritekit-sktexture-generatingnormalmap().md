```

## Return Value

A new texture object that contains a normal map.

## Discussion

A normal map texture is similar to an image texture, but instead of holding image data to be displayed onscreen, every texel represents a normal vector. Normal map textures are used to simulate 3D lighting (see the normalTexture property) or used to generate velocity values (see velocityField(with:)).

You can create normal maps in two different ways. First, you can take an existing image map and use it to generate a normal map. SpriteKit filters the color data in the texture and then uses it to generate a map based on pixel contrast. Alternatively, you can load a regular image file but treat it as a normal map. To do this, provide a texture with 32-bit `RGBx` pixel data. Each componentâ€™s 8-bit integer value is mapped to a floating point number between the values of `-1.0` and `1.0`. Use a `0` to represent `-1.0f`, a value of `127` to represent `0.0`, and a value of `255` to represent `+1.0`.

The image below shows two sprite nodes both with the same texture. The node on the right has a normal map from the same noise texture generated using the generatingNormalMap() method.
