    withConfiguration channelConfiguration: [AnyHashable : Any]!
) -> IOReturn
```

## Parameters 

`channelDelegate`  

The object that will play the role of channel delegate.

`channelConfiguration`  

The dictionary that describes the initial configuration for the channel.

## Return Value

Returns kIOReturnSuccess if the delegate is successfully registered.

## Discussion

A channel delegate is the object the L2CAP channel uses as target for data and events. The developer will implement only the the methods he/she is interested in. A list of the possible methods is at the end of this file in the definition of the informal protocol IOBluetoothL2CAPChannelDelegate. A newly opened L2CAP channel will not complete its configuration process until the client that opened it registers a connectionHandler. This prevents that case where incoming data is received before the client is ready.

NOTE: This method is only available in macOS 10.5 (Bluetooth v2.0) or later.
