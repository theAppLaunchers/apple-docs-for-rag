Instance Method

# writeSync(\_:length:)

Writes the given data synchronously over the target L2CAP channel to the remote device.

macOS

``` source
func writeSync(
    _ data: UnsafeMutableRawPointer!,
    length: UInt16
) -> IOReturn
```

## Parameters 

`data`  

Pointer to the buffer containing the data to send.

`length`  

The length of the given data buffer.

## Return Value

Returns kIOReturnSuccess if the data was written successfully.

## Discussion

The length of the data may not exceed the L2CAP channelâ€™s ougoing MTU. This method will block until the data has been successfully sent to the hardware for transmission (or an error occurs).

NOTE: This method is only available in macOS 10.2.5 (Bluetooth v1.2) or later.
