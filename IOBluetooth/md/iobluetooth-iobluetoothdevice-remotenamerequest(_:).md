Instance Method

# remoteNameRequest(\_:)

Issues a remote name request to the target device.

macOS

``` source
func remoteNameRequest(_ target: Any!) -> IOReturn
```

## Parameters 

`target`  

The target to message when the remote name request is complete

## Return Value

Returns kIOReturnSuccess if the remote name request was successfully issued (and if synchronous, if the request completed successfully).

## Discussion

If a target is specified, the request is asynchronous and on completion of the request, the method

- (void)remoteNameRequestComplete:(IOBluetoothDevice \*)device status:(IOReturn)status;

will be called on the specified target. If no target is specified, the request is made synchronously and wonâ€™t return until the request is complete. This call with operate with the default page timeout value. If a different page timeout value is desired, the method -remoteNameRequest:withPageTimeout: should be used instead.
