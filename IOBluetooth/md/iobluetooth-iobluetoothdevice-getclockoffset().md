Get the clock offset value of the device.

macOS

func getClockOffset() -> BluetoothClockOffset
```

## Return Value

Returns the clock offset value for the device.

This value is only meaningful if the target device has been seen during an inquiry. This can be by checking the result of -getLastInquiryUpdate. If nil is returned, then the device hasnâ€™t been seen.
