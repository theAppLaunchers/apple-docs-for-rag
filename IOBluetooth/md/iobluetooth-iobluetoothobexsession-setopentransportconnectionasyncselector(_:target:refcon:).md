Instance Method

# setOpenTransportConnectionAsyncSelector(\_:target:refCon:)

Allows you to set the selector to be used when a transport connection is opened, or fails to open.

macOS

``` source
func setOpenTransportConnectionAsyncSelector(
    _ inSelector: Selector!,
    target inSelectorTarget: Any!,
    refCon inUserRefCon: UnsafeMutableRawPointer!
)
```

## Parameters 

`inSelector`  

Selector to call on the target.

`inSelectorTarget`  

Target to be called with the selector.

`inUserRefCon`  

Userâ€™s refCon that will get passed to them when their selector is invoked.

## Discussion

You do not need to call this on the session typically, unless you have subclassed the OBEXSession to implement a new transport and that transport supports async opening of connections. If it does not support async open, then using this is pointless.
