Instance Method

# openConnection(\_:withPageTimeout:authenticationRequired:)

Create a baseband connection to the device.

macOS

``` source
func openConnection(
    _ target: Any!,
    withPageTimeout pageTimeoutValue: BluetoothHCIPageTimeout,
    authenticationRequired: Bool
) -> IOReturn
```

## Parameters 

`target`  

The target to message when the create connection call is complete

`pageTimeoutValue`  

The page timeout value to use for this call

`authenticationRequired`  

BOOL value to indicate whether authentication should be required for the connection

## Return Value

Returns kIOReturnSuccess if the connection was successfully created (or if asynchronous, if the CREATE_CONNECTION command was successfully issued).

## Discussion

If a target is specified, the open connection call is asynchronous and on completion of the CREATE_CONNECTION command, the method -connectionComplete:status: will be called on the specified target. If no target is specified, the call is synchronous and will not return until the connection is open or the CREATE_CONNECTION call has failed.

NOTE: This method is only available in macOS 10.2.7 (Bluetooth v1.3) or later.

As of OS X 10.7, this method will no longer mask out “Connection Exists” ‘errors’ with a success result code; your code must account for the cases where the baseband connection is already open.
