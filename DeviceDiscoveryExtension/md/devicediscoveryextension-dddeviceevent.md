iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOSvisionOS 1.0+

``` source
class DDDeviceEvent
```

## Overview

The extension creates and configures an instance of this class to represent a moment of interest in the device discovery life cycle. The eventâ€™s `eventType` (DDDeviceEvent.EventType) describes a particular status.

For example, when the extension discovers a device of interest, it instantiates an instance of this class with the type DDDeviceEvent.EventType.deviceFound.

```
```

Then, the extension provides the discovered device to the system using report(_:) for eventual display in the route picker view (AVRoutePickerView).

```
```
