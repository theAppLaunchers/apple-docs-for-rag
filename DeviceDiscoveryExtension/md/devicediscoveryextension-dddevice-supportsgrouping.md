## Discussion

This property provides a convenient way to send the same media stream to multiple devicesÂ and list them as a group in the AirPlay UI (AVRoutePickerView). For example, a set of speakers arranged around the room can implement stereo playback by each playing different audio channels from an audio stream.

When someone selects a media receiver in the AirPlay menu, the system checks if it supports grouping. If so, the AirPlay UI displays a checkbox next to any other media receivers that also support grouping and implement the same protocol (DDDevice.Protocol).

If a person selects multiple devices in the menu, the selected devices reorder next to each other in the list.

Note

Implement didReceiveEvent(_:) in the DDDiscoveryExtension to detect when a person changes the device grouping using the AirPlay UI.
