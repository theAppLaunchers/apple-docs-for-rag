# is_trial_period

An indicator of whether an auto-renewable subscription is in the free trial period.

App Store Receipts 1.0â€“1.7Deprecated

``` source
string is_trial_period
```

## Possible Values 

`true`  

The subscription is in the free trial period.

`false`  

The subscription is not in the free trial period.

## Discussion

This field is returned in the JSON response, in the responseBody.Latest_receipt_info and responseBody.Receipt.In_app arrays.

You can use this value to determine whether the specific record is in a subscription trial period. If a previous subscription period in the receipt has the value `"true" `for either the `is_trial_period` or is_in_intro_offer_period keys, the user is not eligible for a free trial or introductory price within that subscription group.
