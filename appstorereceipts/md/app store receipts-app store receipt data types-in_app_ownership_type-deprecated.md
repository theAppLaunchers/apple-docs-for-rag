`PURCHASED`  

The transaction belongs to the purchaser.

## Discussion

When family members benefit from a shared subscription, App Store updates their receipt to include the family-shared purchase. Use the value of `in_app_ownership_type` to understand whether a transaction belongs to the purchaser or a family member who benefits.

This field appears in the App Store server notifications unified receipt (unified_receipt.Latest_receipt_info) and in transaction receipts (responseBody.Latest_receipt_info).
