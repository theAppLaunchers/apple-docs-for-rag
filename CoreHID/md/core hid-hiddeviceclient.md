Communicating with human interface devices

## Overview

A human interface device (HID) is a computer peripheral intended to provide direction to the system from human input. The specification is a broad, industry-wide standard, maintained by the USB Implementers Forum. For more details, see Human Interface Devices (HID) Specifications and Tools.

A HIDDeviceClient is a connection to one HID device on the system. Itâ€™s created using a HIDDeviceClient.DeviceReference, received from a HIDDeviceManager. A HIDDeviceClient.DeviceReference is a simple reference to a specific HID device. The HID peripheral can be a USB device like a wired mouse, a Bluetooth device like a wireless keyboard, an onboard sensor like an accelerometer, or even a software based, virtual peripheral created using HIDVirtualDevice.

A HIDDeviceClient receives device notifications, such as input HID reports that are dispatched from the device in response to human input (like a keyboard key press) in monitorNotifications(reportIDsToMonitor:elementsToMonitor:). It sends get and set reports to the device to retrieve information or configure device functionality using dispatchSetReportRequest(type:id:data:timeout:). dispatchGetReportRequest(type:id:timeout:). It monitors or updates specific pieces of the HID report using HIDElement.

## Topics

### Create a device client

init?(deviceReference: HIDDeviceClient.DeviceReference)

Creates a client for a HID device.

struct DeviceReference

A reference to a HID device on the system.

let deviceReference: HIDDeviceClient.DeviceReference

The reference to the HID device used to create the HID client device.

### Get device information

var descriptor: Data

The HID specification compliant report descriptor for the associated HID device.

var deviceUsages: [HIDUsage]

A convenient list of all the usages that the device supports.

var isBuiltIn: Bool

A Boolean value that determines whether the device is built-in to the system or an external peripheral.

var localizationCode: HIDDeviceLocalizationCode

A location code that specifies the HID compliant localization code, if there is one.

var locationID: UInt64?

The location ID for the device, if there is one.

var manufacturer: String?

The manufacturer of the device, if known.

var modelNumber: String?

The model number for the device, if known.

let primaryUsage: HIDUsage

The HID specification compliant usage for the device.

var product: String?

The product name for the device, if known.

let productID: UInt32

The product ID for the device.

var serialNumber: String?

The serial number of the device, if known.

var transport: HIDDeviceTransport?

The data transport for the device.

var uniqueID: String?

A unique ID for the device, if there is one.

let vendorID: UInt32

The vendor ID for the device.

var versionNumber: UInt64?

The version of the device, if known.

var elements: [HIDElement]

All HID elements associated with the device.

### Interact with the device

func dispatchGetReportRequest(type: HIDReportType, id: HIDReportID?, timeout: Duration?) async throws -> Data

Send a get report request to the device over the transport.

func dispatchSetReportRequest(type: HIDReportType, id: HIDReportID?, data: Data, timeout: Duration?) async throws

Send a set report request to the device over the transport.

func seizeDevice() throws

Attempt to obtain the device so that this client is the only active client.

### Monitor device notifications

func monitorNotifications(reportIDsToMonitor: [ClosedRange&lt;HIDReportID>], elementsToMonitor: [HIDElement]) -> AsyncThrowingStream&lt;HIDDeviceClient.Notification, any Error>

Creates an asynchronous that receives notifications about the associated device.

enum Notification

Notifications for a HID device.

### Update element values

func updateElements([any HIDElementUpdate], timeout: Duration?) async -> HIDDeviceClient.HIDElementUpdateResult

Provide new update values for, or request current values from, lists of elements.

struct RequestElementUpdate

A request to pull the current value from a list of HID elements

struct ProvideElementUpdate

A structure that provides values for a list of HID elements.

struct HIDElementUpdateResult

A class to hold the results of an element update.

### Structures

struct UnsafeProperty

A wrapper around an object to facilitate working with subscripts.

### Instance Properties

var unownedExecutor: UnownedSerialExecutor

Retrieve the executor for this actor as an optimized, unowned reference.

### Subscripts

subscript(String) -> HIDDeviceClient.UnsafeProperty?

Get or set a property from the device.
