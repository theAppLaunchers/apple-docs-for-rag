Instance Method

# preconditionIsolated(\_:file:line:)

Stops program execution if the current task is not executing on this actor’s serial executor.

Core HIDSwiftiOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+macOS 10.15+tvOS 13.0+watchOS 6.0+

``` source
@backDeployed(before: macOS 14.0, iOS 17.0, watchOS 10.0, tvOS 17.0)
nonisolated
func preconditionIsolated(
    _ message: @autoclosure () -> String = String(),
    file: StaticString = #fileID,
    line: UInt = #line
)
```

## Parameters 

`message`  

The message to print if the assertion fails.

`file`  

The file name to print if the assertion fails. The default is where this method was called.

`line`  

The line number to print if the assertion fails The default is where this method was called.

## Discussion

This function’s effect varies depending on the build flag used:

- In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode’s Debug configuration), stops program execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.

- In `-O` builds (the default for Xcode’s Release configuration), stops program execution.

Note

This check is performed against the actor’s serial executor, meaning that / if another actor uses the same serial executor–by using that actor’s serial executor as its own `Actor/unownedExecutor`–this check will succeed , as from a concurrency safety perspective, the serial executor guarantees mutual exclusion of those two actors.
