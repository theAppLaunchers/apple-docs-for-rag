Instance Method

# seizeDevice()

Attempt to obtain the device so that this client is the only active client.

macOS 15.0+

``` source
func seizeDevice() throws
```

## Discussion

If successful, this client is the only one that receives notifications using monitorNotifications(reportIDsToMonitor:elementsToMonitor:), and the only one that can use certain functions to interact with the device. The device wonâ€™t be freed until the client that holds it is deinitialized. There must not be any outstanding calls when attempting to seize a device.

Throws

HIDDeviceError if the attempt to seize the device is unsuccessful. Notably, HIDDeviceError.busy is thrown if there are outstanding calls to monitorNotifications(reportIDsToMonitor:elementsToMonitor:), dispatchSetReportRequest(type:id:data:timeout:), dispatchGetReportRequest(type:id:timeout:), or updateElements(_:timeout:); and HIDDeviceError.exclusiveAccess is thrown if the device is currently seized by another client.
