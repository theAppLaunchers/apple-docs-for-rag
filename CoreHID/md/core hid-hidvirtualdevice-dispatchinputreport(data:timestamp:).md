Instance Method

# dispatchInputReport(data:timestamp:)

Dispatch an input report to the system.

macOS 15.0+

``` source
func dispatchInputReport(
    data: Data,
    timestamp: SuspendingClock.Instant
) async throws
```

## Parameters 

`data`  

The bytes to send as a part of the input report. Determining the correct values can be aided by referencing the deviceâ€™s report descriptor. If there are multiple reports, the first byte should be the report ID.

`timestamp`  

The time that the report originated.

## Discussion

This dispatches an input report to the system, as if a person is interacting with a physical control. For example, if the virtual device represents a keyboard, a keyboard report can be dispatched here to simulate a person pressing a key on the keyboard. The system receives the report and any HIDDeviceClient devices monitoring for such activity. activate(delegate:) must run successfully before this function runs.

Throws

HIDDeviceError if there is an issue with the request.
