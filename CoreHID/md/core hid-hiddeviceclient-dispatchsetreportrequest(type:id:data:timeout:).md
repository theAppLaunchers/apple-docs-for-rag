Instance Method

# dispatchSetReportRequest(type:id:data:timeout:)

Send a set report request to the device over the transport.

macOS 15.0+

``` source
func dispatchSetReportRequest(
    type: HIDReportType,
    id: HIDReportID? = nil,
    data: Data,
    timeout: Duration? = nil
) async throws
```

## Parameters 

`type`  

The HIDReportType of the report.

`id`  

The ID of the provided report, determined from the report descriptor. This is unnecessary if the descriptor has only one report.

`data`  

The bytes to send as a part of the request. Determining the correct values can be aided by referencing the deviceâ€™s descriptor.

`timeout`  

The maximum amount of time to wait for the device to receive the report before the calls time out and fails. Not providing a duration causes the call to wait forever.

## Discussion

Many HID devices accept set report requests to send data to the device or alter functionality. Exactly how a device interprets a set report depends on the device specific implementation, but most devices conform to the reports that they declare in their report descriptor. This function throws if another client obtains the device.

For more details, see Human Interface Devices (HID) Specifications and Tools.

Throws

HIDDeviceError if there is an issue with the request.
