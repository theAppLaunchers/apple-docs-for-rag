optional func physicsWorld(
    _ world: SCNPhysicsWorld,
    didUpdate contact: SCNPhysicsContact
)
```

## Parameters 

`world`  

The physics world that is processing the contact.

`contact`  

An object that describes the contact.

## Discussion

SceneKit calls this method on each step of the physics simulation (see the timeStep property) if information about the contact changesâ€”for example, if two bodies are sliding against one another.
