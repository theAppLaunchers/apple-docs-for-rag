```

## Discussion

When rendering materials with the physicallyBased lighting model, SceneKit illuminates surfaces differently according to the environment that surrounds them. For example, with physically based shading, even a diffuse surface takes on some color from the sky above it and the ground below it.

Tip

For realistic results, reuse the same contents for both the lighting environment and the background property.

For information about defining cube maps, see the discussion of the contents property.
