## Discussion

When using a High Dynamic Range (HDR) camera, SceneKit applies a process called *tone mapping* to translate the wide range of luminance values in the visible scene to the narrower range of brightness values that can be shown on a display. SceneKit determines a tone mapping curve from the minimumExposure, maximumExposure, exposureOffset, and whitePoint properties, along with a measure of scene luminance.

The default value is `1.0`. By setting this property to a higher or lower value, you can produce more gradual or more abrupt transitions between shadows and highlights.

This property has no effect if the wantsHDR value is false.
