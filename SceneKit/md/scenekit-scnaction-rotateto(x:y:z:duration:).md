Type Method

# rotateTo(x:y:z:duration:)

Creates an action that rotates the node to absolute angles in each of the three principal axes.

``` source
class func rotateTo(
    x xAngle: CGFloat,
    y yAngle: CGFloat,
    z zAngle: CGFloat,
    duration: TimeInterval
) -> SCNAction
```

## Parameters 

`xAngle`  

The amount to rotate the node counterclockwise around the x-axis of its local coordinate space, in radians.

`yAngle`  

The amount to rotate the node counterclockwise around the y-axis of its local coordinate space, in radians.

`zAngle`  

The amount to rotate the node counterclockwise around the z-axis of its local coordinate space, in radians.

`duration`  

The duration, in seconds, of the animation.

## Return Value

A new action object.

## Discussion

When the action executes, the nodeâ€™s rotation property animates to the new angle. Calling this method is equivalent to calling rotateTo(x:y:z:duration:usesShortestUnitArc:) and passing false for the `shortestUnitArc` parameter.

This action is not reversible; the reverse of this action has the same duration but does not change anything.
