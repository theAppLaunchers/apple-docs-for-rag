# suspensionStiffness

The spring coefficient of the suspension between the vehicle and the wheel.

var suspensionStiffness: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

The spring coefficient determines both how quickly the wheel returns to its natural position after a shock (for example, when the vehicle runs over a bump) and how much force from the shock it transmits to the vehicle. The default spring coefficient is `2.0`.
