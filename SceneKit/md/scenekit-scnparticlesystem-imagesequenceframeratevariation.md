## Discussion

Setting a nonzero value for this property randomizes the effect of the imageSequenceFrameRate property. SceneKit randomly adjusts the animation speed for each particle by up to half the imageSequenceFrameRateVariation value. For example, if the imageSequenceFrameRate value is `10.0` frames per second and the imageSequenceFrameRateVariation value is `10.0` seconds, each particle animates at a random rate between `5.0` and `15.0` frames per second.

The default value is `0.0` frames per second, specifying no randomization.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
