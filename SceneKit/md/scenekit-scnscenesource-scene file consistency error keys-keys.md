# Scene File Consistency Error Keys

Keys identifying errors found during a scene-file-format consistency check.

## Overview

If you specify true for the checkConsistency when creating or loading from a scene source, SceneKit verifies the scene file against the specification for its file format. SceneKit reports any format verification issues that occur as an array of dictionaries, identified by the in the SCNDetailedErrorsKey key in the userInfo dictionary of an NSError object. Each item in the array is a dictionary containing one or more of the keys listed above.

These keys and their values provide details about the location of the error in the scene file. Other properties of the returned NSError object describe the nature of the validation error.
