## Discussion

You provide this array of NSValue objects, each containing an SCNMatrix4 value, in the init(shapes:transforms:) method to create a compound shape. Use this array along with the sourceObject property to recover the information that was used to create the shape.

If the shape was created with the init(geometry:options:) or init(node:options:) method, this propertyâ€™s value is `nil`.
