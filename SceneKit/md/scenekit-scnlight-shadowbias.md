## Discussion

Rendering shadows from a shadow map can result in artifacts where the shadow color does not appear on all pixels in a shadowed surface as intended. (This effect is typically called *shadow acne*.) This property specifies the error margin SceneKit uses to correct such artifacts.

The default value is `1.0`.
