## Discussion

After each particle is spawned, it appears in the scene for a period of this duration before being removed from the scene. You can randomize the life spans of newly spawned particles with the particleLifeSpanVariation property.

The default value is `1.0` seconds.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
