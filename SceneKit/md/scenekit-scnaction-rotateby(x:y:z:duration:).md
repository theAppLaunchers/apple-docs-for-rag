Type Method

# rotateBy(x:y:z:duration:)

Creates an action that rotates the node in each of the three principal axes by angles relative to its current orientation.

``` source
class func rotateBy(
    x xAngle: CGFloat,
    y yAngle: CGFloat,
    z zAngle: CGFloat,
    duration: TimeInterval
) -> SCNAction
```

## Parameters 

`xAngle`  

The amount to rotate the node counterclockwise around the x-axis of its local coordinate space, in radians.

`yAngle`  

The amount to rotate the node counterclockwise around the y-axis of its local coordinate space, in radians.

`zAngle`  

The amount to rotate the node counterclockwise around the z-axis of its local coordinate space, in radians.

`duration`  

The duration, in seconds, of the animation.

## Return Value

A new action object.

## Discussion

When the action executes, the nodeâ€™s rotation property animates to the new angle.

This action is reversible; the reverse is created as if the following code had been executed:

```
[SCNAction rotateByX: -xAngle y: -yAngle z: -zAngle duration: duration];
```
