## Overview

Use animation events to add actions to animations, such as playing a sound to coincide with the movement of an animated character, or removing a node from the scene after playing an animation that fades out its visible geometry.

After you create an animation event, you attach it to an animation object using the objectâ€™s animationEvents property.
