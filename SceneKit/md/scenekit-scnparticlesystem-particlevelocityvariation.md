## Discussion

Setting a nonzero value for this property randomizes the effect of the particleVelocity property. SceneKit randomly adjusts the initial speed of each particle by up to half the particleVelocityVariation value. For example, if the particleVelocity value is `10.0` units per second and the particleVelocityVariation value is `5.0` units per second, newly spawned particles have random velocities between `7.5` and `12.5` units per second.

The default value is `0.0` units per second, specifying no randomization.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
