## Discussion

A bloom effect adds a soft glow to highlights (areas of bright color) in the rendered scene, simulating the way bright highlights appear to the human eye or a physical camera in a real-world scene. The bloom effect combines selective brightening and blurring effects; this property controls the blur portion of the effect. A value of zero effectively disables the bloom effect, and higher values result in a broader, softer glow. The default value is `4.0` pixels.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.

To enable this behavior, you must first enable the wantsHDR setting.
