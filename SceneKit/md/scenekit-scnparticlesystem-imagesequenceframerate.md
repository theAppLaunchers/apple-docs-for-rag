## Discussion

To specify a sequence of frames for animating each particle, arrange the frames as a grid in a single image, as shown in Figure 1. Then use the imageSequenceRowCount and imageSequenceColumnCount properties to specify the arrangement of frames in the images, and this property to define animation speed.

The default value is `0.0` frames per second, specifying no animation.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
