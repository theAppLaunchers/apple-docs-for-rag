``` source
class func group(_ actions: [SCNAction]) -> SCNAction
```

## Parameters 

`actions`  

An array of SCNAction objects.

## Return Value

A new group action object.

## Discussion

When the action executes, the actions that make up the group all start immediately and run in parallel. The duration of the group action is the longest duration among the collection of actions. If an action in the group has a duration less than the groupâ€™s duration, the action completes and then idles until the group completes the remaining actions. This matters most when creating a repeating action that repeats a group.

This action is reversible; it creates a new group action that contains the reverse of each action specified in the group.
