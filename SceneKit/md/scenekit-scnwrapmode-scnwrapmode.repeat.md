Case

# SCNWrapMode.repeat

Texture sampling uses only the fractional part of texture coordinates, passing through the range from `0.0` to (but not including) `1.0`.

SCNRepeat

## Discussion

Texture sampling in areas of the material whose texture coordinates would fall outside from `0.0` to `1.0` results in tiling the texture image across the surface using the material.

### Constants

case clamp

Texture coordinates are clamped to the range from `0.0` to `1.0`, inclusive.

case clampToBorder

Texture sampling uses texture colors for coordinates in the range from `0.0` to `1.0` (inclusive) and the material propertyâ€™s borderColor value otherwise.

case mirror

Texture sampling of texture coordinates outside range from `0.0` to `1.0` should behave as if the range reverses before repeating.
