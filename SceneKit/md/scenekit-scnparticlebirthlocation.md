Options for the initial location of each emitted particle, used by the birthLocation property.

## Overview

The emitterShape property determines the shape of the space in which new particles can be emitted, and the birthLocation property determines the locations of new particles relative to this shape.

To make a systemâ€™s particles emit from a single point, set the emitterShape property to `nil` (the default). In this case, SceneKit ignores the birthLocation property.

## Topics

### Constants

case surface

New particles can be created at any location on the surface of the emitter shape.

case volume

New particles can be created at any location within the volume of the emitter shape.

case vertex

New particles can be created at only at the locations of the vertices in the emitter shape.
