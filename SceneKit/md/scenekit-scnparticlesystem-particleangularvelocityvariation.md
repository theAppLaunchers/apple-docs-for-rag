## Discussion

Setting a nonzero value for this property randomizes the effect of the particleAngularVelocity property. SceneKit randomly adjusts the initial angular velocity of each particle by up to half the particleAngularVelocityVariation value. For example, if the particleAngularVelocity value is `10.0` degrees per second and the particleAngularVelocityVariation value is `5.0` degrees per second, newly spawned particles spin at random speeds between `7.5` and `12.5` degrees per second.

The default value is `0.0` degrees per second, specifying no randomization.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
