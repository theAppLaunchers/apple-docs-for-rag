## Overview

The vertex data and normal vectors in a geometry designate which side of each polygon is to be considered its front face, and the geometryâ€™s orientation with respect to the camera determines which front surfaces are currently visible. Typically, back-facing surfaces are found only on the interior of a closed geometry, obscured by front-facing surfaces, so rendering these surfaces has a performance cost but no visible effect.
