# Built-in Geometry Types

Basic shapes—such as spheres, boxes, and planes—and features for generating 3D objects from 2D text and Bézier curves.

## Topics

### Parametric Geometry

class SCNText

A geometry based on a string of text, optionally extruded to create a three-dimensional object.

class SCNShape

A geometry based on a two-dimensional path, optionally extruded to create a three-dimensional object.

### Basic Shapes

class SCNFloor

A plane that can optionally display a reflection of the scene above it.

class SCNBox

A six-sided polyhedron geometry whose faces are all rectangles, optionally with rounded edges and corners.

class SCNCapsule

A right circular cylinder geometry whose ends are capped with hemispheres.

class SCNCone

A right circular cone or frustum geometry.

class SCNCylinder

A right circular cylinder geometry.

class SCNPlane

A rectangular, one-sided plane geometry of specified width and height.

class SCNPyramid

A right rectangular pyramid geometry.

class SCNSphere

A sphere (or ball or globe) geometry.

class SCNTorus

A torus, or ring-shaped geometry.

class SCNTube

A tube or pipe geometry—a right circular cylinder with a circular hole along its central axis.

### Geometry

class SCNGeometry

A three-dimensional shape (also called a model or mesh) that can be displayed in a scene, with attached materials that define its appearance.

class SCNGeometrySource

A container for vertex data forming part of the definition for a three-dimensional object, or geometry.

class SCNGeometryElement

A container for index data describing how vertices connect to define a three-dimensional object, or geometry.
