## Discussion

The sphere is centered in its local coordinate system. For example, if you create a sphere whose radius is `5.0`, it extends from `-5.0` to `5.0` along each of the the x, y, and z-axes. A radius of zero or less creates an empty geometry.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
