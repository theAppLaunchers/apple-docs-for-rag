## Discussion

The new transaction is nested within the threadâ€™s current transaction, if there is one.

The first time you modify the scene graph during a pass through the run loop, SceneKit automatically creates a transaction and makes it the current transaction. (SceneKit commits that transaction when the next iteration of the run loops begins.) If you call this method to create a custom transaction before modifying the scene graph, your custom transaction becomes the current transaction.
