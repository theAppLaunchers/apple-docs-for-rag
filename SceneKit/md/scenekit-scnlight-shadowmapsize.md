## Discussion

SceneKit produces shadows by rendering the silhouettes of scene geometry into a 2D shadow map image and then projecting that image into the rendered scene. A larger shadow map image produces more detailed shadows at a higher cost to rendering performance; a smaller shadow map renders more quickly but results in pixelation at the edges of shadows.

The default value is CGSizeZero, specifying that SceneKit chooses a shadow map size automatically.
