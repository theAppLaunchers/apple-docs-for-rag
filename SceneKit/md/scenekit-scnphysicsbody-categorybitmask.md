# categoryBitMask

A mask that defines which categories this physics body belongs to.

## Discussion

Every physics body in a scene can be assigned to one or more categories, each corresponding to a bit in the bit mask. You define the mask values used in your game. Use this property together with the physicsShape and contactTestBitMask properties to define which physics bodies interact with each other and when your game is notified of interactions.

The default value is static for static bodies and default for dynamic and kinematic bodies.
