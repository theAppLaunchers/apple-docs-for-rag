## Discussion

The system emits this number of particles at a constant rate through the duration of the period specified by the emissionDuration property. A value of zero prevents the system from emitting particles, unless you randomize the birth rate with the birthRateVariation property.

The default value is `1`.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
