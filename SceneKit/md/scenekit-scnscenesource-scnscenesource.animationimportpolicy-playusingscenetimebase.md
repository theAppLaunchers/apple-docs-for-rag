static let playUsingSceneTimeBase: SCNSceneSource.AnimationImportPolicy
```

## Discussion

Using this policy is equivalent to manually loading each animation, setting its usesSceneTimeBase property to true, and adding it to the appropriate element of the scene. Use this policy when you want to directly control (or let the user directly control) the progress of animations.
