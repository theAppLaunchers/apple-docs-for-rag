## Discussion

Use this property to speed up or slow down the overall behavior of a particle system without changing the many individual properties (such as acceleration, particleAngularVelocity, and particleBounce) that affect the motion of particles.

The default value is 1.0. Lower values slow down the effect; higher values make the effect run faster.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
