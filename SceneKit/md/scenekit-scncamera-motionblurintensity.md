## Discussion

The default intensity of zero results in no motion blur effect. Higher values (toward a maximum of 1.0) create more pronounced motion blur effects.

Motion blur is not supported when wide-gamut color rendering is enabled. Wide-gamut rendering is enabled by default on supported devices; to opt out, set the `SCNDisableWideGamut` key in your app’s `Info.plist` file.

You can animate changes to this property’s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
