## Discussion

In photographic and stage lighting terminology, a gobo (also known as a *flag* or *cookie*) is a stencil, gel, or other object placed just in front of a light source, shaping or coloring the beam of light.

You alter the appearance of a spotlight by changing the contents property of the object permanently assigned to this property. As with other material properties, you can use a color or image, or a Core Animation layer containing animated content, as a lighting gobo.

This property applies only to lights whose type property is spot.
