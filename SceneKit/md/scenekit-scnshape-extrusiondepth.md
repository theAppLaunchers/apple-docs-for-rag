## Discussion

The extruded shape is centered at the zero point of its z-axis. For example, an extrusion depth of `1.0` creates a shape that extends from `-0.5` to `0.5` along the z-axis. An extrusion depth of zero creates a flat, one-sided shape.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
