var geometry: SCNGeometry? { get }

## Discussion

SceneKit renders this geometry instead of the original geometry when the level of detail is appropriate. Generally, levels of detail with larger worldSpaceDistance values or smaller screenSpaceRadius values should contain less complex geometries.

If the value of this property is `nil`, SceneKit renders no geometry at this level of detail.
