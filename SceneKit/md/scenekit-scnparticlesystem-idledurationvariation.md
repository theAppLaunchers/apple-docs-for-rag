## Discussion

Setting a nonzero value for this property randomizes the effect of the idleDuration property. For each idle period, SceneKit randomly adjusts the duration by up to half the idleDurationVariation value. For example, if the idleDuration value is `1.0` seconds and the idleDurationVariation value is `0.5` seconds, the system idles for a period of `0.75` to `1.25` seconds between emissions.

The default value is `0.0` seconds, specifying no randomization.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
