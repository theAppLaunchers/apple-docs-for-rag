## Discussion

Objects at this distance from the camera appear perfectly focused. Objects nearer to or farther from the camera than this distance appear increasingly blurred, with the behavior of the blur effect depending on the fStop, apertureBladeCount and focalBlurSampleCount properties. The default focus distance is `2.5`.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
