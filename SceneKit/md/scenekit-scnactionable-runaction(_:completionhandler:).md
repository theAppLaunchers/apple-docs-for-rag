    completionHandler block: (() -> Void)? = nil
)
```

```

## Parameters 

`action`  

The action to be performed.

`block`  

A completion block that SceneKit calls when the action completes.

## Discussion

Concurrency Note

In Swift, you can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
func runAction(_ action: SCNAction) async
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

The new action is processed the next time SceneKit prepares to render a frame.

SceneKit calls your block after the actionâ€™s duration is complete. For example, in a game you could use this method to show a Game Over message after performing a fade-out action on a node that displays a player character.
