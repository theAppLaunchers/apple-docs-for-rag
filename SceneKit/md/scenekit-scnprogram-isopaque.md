## Discussion

The default value is true, indicating that all fragments rendered by the program are fully opaque. In this case, SceneKit can composite these fragments into the final image without blending, improving rendering performance.

If your shader program renders fragment colors whose alpha value is less than `1.0`, change this propertyâ€™s value to false for proper blending.
