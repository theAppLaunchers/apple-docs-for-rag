## Discussion

Setting a nonzero value for this property randomizes the effect of the emissionDuration property. For each emission period, SceneKit randomly adjusts the duration by up to half the emissionDurationVariation value. For example, if the emissionDuration value is `1.0` seconds and the emissionDurationVariation value is `0.5` seconds, the system emits particles over a period of `0.75` to `1.25` seconds before stopping.

The default value is `0.0` seconds, specifying no randomization.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
