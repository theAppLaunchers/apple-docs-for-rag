## Discussion

If the the emitterShape property value is `nil` or the birthDirection property value is SCNParticleBirthDirection.constant, newly spawned particles emit in the direction specified by this property. You can randomize the direction of newly spawned particles with the spreadingAngle property.

The default value is the vector `{0.0, 0.0, 1.0}`, specifying that particles emit in the direction of the positive z-axis.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
