## Discussion

You provide this dictionary in the init(geometry:options:) or init(node:options:) method. Use this dictionary along with the sourceObject property to recover the information that was used to create the shape.

If the shape was created with the init(shapes:transforms:) method, this propertyâ€™s value is `nil`.
