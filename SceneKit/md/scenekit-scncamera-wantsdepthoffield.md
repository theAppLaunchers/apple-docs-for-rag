# wantsDepthOfField

A Boolean value that determines whether SceneKit renders depth-of-field blur effects for the camera.

## Discussion

This value is false by default, disabling depth-of-field effects.

Enabling this property causes SceneKit to render blur effects that model those created by a physical camera device (also known as *bokeh*). That is, objects in the scene appear more or less blurry depending on their distance from the camera and the cameraâ€™s focusDistance, and the intensity and style of the blur effect depend on the fStop and apertureBladeCount properties.

Note

For best results, also enable the wantsHDR property when using depth-of-field effects. High Dynamic Range rendering provides high contrast for distant bright points in the scene, creating more pronounced bokeh effects.
