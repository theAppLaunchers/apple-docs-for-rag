# maximumSuspensionForce

The maximum force of the suspension between the vehicle and the wheel, in newtons.

var maximumSuspensionForce: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

The physics simulation applies a force of no greater than this magnitude when contact with the ground causes the wheel to move relative to the vehicle. The default maximum suspension force is `6000.0`.
