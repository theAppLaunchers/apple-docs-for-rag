## Discussion

If false (the default), all positions, distances, and velocities in the particle system are in the sceneâ€™s world coordinate system. If true, the particle system runs in the local coordinate space of the node containing it.

Use this property to choose whether particles spawned by a moving emitter follow the system as it moves.
