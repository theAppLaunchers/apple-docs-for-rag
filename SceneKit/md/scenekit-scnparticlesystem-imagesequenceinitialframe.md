## Discussion

To specify a sequence of frames for animating each particle, arrange the frames as a grid in a single image, as shown in Figure 1. The total number of frames in an image sequence is the product of multiplying the imageSequenceRowCount and imageSequenceColumnCount properties. Frames are numbered starting at zero, indicating the top left image in the grid.

When you use image sequences for particles, SceneKit interpolates between frames of animation, so a fractional value specifies a partial fade between two animation frames.

The default value is `0.0`, specifying that animation begins with the top left image in the grid.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
