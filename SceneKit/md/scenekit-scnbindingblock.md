``` source
typealias SCNBindingBlock = (UInt32, UInt32, SCNNode?, SCNRenderer) -> Void
```

## Discussion

The block takes the following parameters:

`programID`  
The OpenGL program identifier for the current SCNProgram instance, as used by OpenGL functions such as `glValidateProgram`.

`location`  
The OpenGL location index for the symbol to be bound or unbound, as used by OpenGL functions such as `glUniform`.

`renderedNode`  
The SCNNode object being rendered.

`renderer`  
The SCNRenderer object responsible for rendering.

Call handleBinding(ofSymbol:handler:) or handleUnbinding(ofSymbol:handler:) to associate a handler block with a GLSL symbol for a SceneKit geometry or material.
