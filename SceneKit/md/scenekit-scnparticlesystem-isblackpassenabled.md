``` source
var isBlackPassEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Set this property to true to enhance visual contrast when using additive blending. The default value is false.

Important

Because a black pass requires rendering the entire particle system twice, enabling this option can severely affect rendering performance.
