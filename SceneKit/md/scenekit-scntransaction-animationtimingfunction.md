## Return Value

The media timing function for the transactionâ€™s animations.

## Discussion

Media timing functions, also known as *animation curves*, define the relationship between the elapsed time of an animation and its effect on a property. For example, the easeInEaseOut function creates an effect that begins slowly, speeds up, and then finishes slowly.
