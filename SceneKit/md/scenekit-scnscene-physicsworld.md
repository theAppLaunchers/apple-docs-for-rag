## Discussion

Every scene automatically creates a physics world object to simulate physics on nodes in the scene. You use this property to access the sceneâ€™s global physics properties, such as gravity, and to manage physics interactions between nodes. To make a node in the scene participate in the physics simulation, use either or both of its physicsBody and physicsField properties.
