SCNClampToBorder

## Discussion

Texture sampling in areas whose texture coordinates would fall outside this range uses the borderColor property instead of texel colors from the texture image.

### Constants

case clamp

Texture coordinates are clamped to the range from `0.0` to `1.0`, inclusive.

case `repeat`

Texture sampling uses only the fractional part of texture coordinates, passing through the range from `0.0` to (but not including) `1.0`.

case mirror

Texture sampling of texture coordinates outside range from `0.0` to `1.0` should behave as if the range reverses before repeating.
