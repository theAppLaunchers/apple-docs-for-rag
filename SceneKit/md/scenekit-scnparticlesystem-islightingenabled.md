var isLightingEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

If true, SceneKit uses the position, color, and other attributes of SCNLight objects in the scene to shade each rendered particle image. Use this option to enhance volumetric effects such as smoke and fog.

The default value is false.

Note

SceneKit uses only one SCNLight object to illuminate rendered particles. Use the categoryBitMask of the node containing the particle system to control which light applies to the particles.
