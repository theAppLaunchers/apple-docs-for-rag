``` source
func identifiersOfEntries(withClass entryClass: AnyClass) -> [String]
```

## Parameters 

`entryClass`  

The class of objects to find identifiers for.

## Return Value

An array of NSString objects, each the unique identifier of an object in the scene source.

## Discussion

SceneKit recognizes objects of the following classes in scene files:

- CAAnimation

- NSImage

- SCNCamera

- SCNGeometry

- SCNLight

- SCNMaterial

- SCNMorpher

- SCNNode

- SCNScene

- SCNSkinner

Each object in a scene file has an identifier that is unique for its class. These identifiers are determined by the software that created the scene fileâ€”for example, they may be descriptive names assigned by an artist using 3D authoring tools. For SceneKit classes with a name property (such as nodes and geometries), the name of an object loaded from a scene file is based on its identifier in the scene file.

Use this method to enumerate all objects in a scene file of a specified class without loading the objects and their content. For example, the following code finds the identifiers for all animations stored in a scene source:

```
NSArray *animations = [sceneSource identifiersOfEntriesWithClass:[CAAnimation class]];
```
