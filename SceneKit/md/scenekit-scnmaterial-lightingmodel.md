## Discussion

SceneKit provides several different lighting models, each of which combines information from a materialâ€™s visual properties with the lights and other contents of a scene. For details on how each lighting model affects rendering, see `Lighting Models`. For details on the contribution from each visual property, see Visual Properties for Special Effects.
