## Discussion

Setting a nonzero value for this property randomizes the effect of the birthRate property. For each emission period, SceneKit randomly adjusts the birth rate by up to half the birthRateVariation value. For example, if the birthRate value is `100` particles and the birthRateVariation value is `50` particles, the system randomly emits between 75 and 125 particles during its emissionDuration period.

The default value is `0.0` seconds, specifying no randomization.

You can animate changes to this propertyâ€™s value. See Animating SceneKit Content.
