``` source
class func customAction(
    duration seconds: TimeInterval,
    action block: @escaping (SCNNode, CGFloat) -> Void
) -> SCNAction
```

## Parameters 

`seconds`  

The duration of the action, in seconds.

`block`  

The block to run. The block takes the following parameters:

*node*  
The node on which the action is running.

*elapsedTime*  
The amount of time that has passed since the action began executing.

## Return Value

A new action object.

## Discussion

When the action executes, SceneKit calls the block repeatedly until the actionâ€™s duration expires. For each call, SceneKit computes the elapsed time and passes it to the block.

This action is not reversible; the reverse action executes the same block.
