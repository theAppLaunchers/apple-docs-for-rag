## Discussion

When using a High Dynamic Range (HDR) camera, SceneKit applies a process called *tone mapping* to translate the wide range of luminance values in the visible scene to the narrower range of brightness values that can be shown on a display. SceneKit determines a tone mapping curve from the minimumExposure, maximumExposure, exposureOffset, and whitePoint properties, along with a measure of scene luminance.

Exposure values are exponential: a value of `1.0` doubles brightness, a value of `2.0` quadruples brightness, a value of `-1.0` halves brightness, and so on. The default value is `-15.0`. Increasing the value causes darker portions of the scene to become under-exposed (uniformly black, losing definition). Decreasing the value adds more dynamic range for darker portions of the scene; however, a greater breadth of difference between the minimum and maximum exposures decreases contrast.

This property has no effect if the wantsHDR value is false.
