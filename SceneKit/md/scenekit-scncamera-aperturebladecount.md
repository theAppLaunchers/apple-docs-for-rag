## Discussion

When the wantsDepthOfField setting is enabled, SceneKit renders scenes using the camera with a depth-of-field blur (also called *bokeh*) effect modeled after those created by a real-world physical camera. One feature of real-world camera bokeh effects is the tendency of distant bright points to blur into larger shapes based on the shape of the aperture between the cameraâ€™s lens and its imaging plane (film or sensor). Physical cameras control aperture using a mechanism that moves several flat blades in or out to create a smaller or larger opening, so the natural bokeh effect in traditional photography produces polygon-shaped blur effects.

This property controls the number of blades in the simulated camera aperture, and thus the polygon shape seen in the resulting bokeh effect. For example, a blade count of 6 (the default) causes distant bright points to blur into hexagon shapes. Increasingly large blade counts result in the bokeh effect appearing more circular, as shown below.
