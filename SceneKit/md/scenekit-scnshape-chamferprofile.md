## Discussion

The value of this property must be a two-dimensional path starting at the point `{1, 0}` and ending at the point `{0, 1}`, determining the contour of the shape along its extruded sides, as illustrated in the figure below. If the value of this property is `nil` and the value of the chamferRadius property is greater than zero, SceneKit uses a chamfer profile in the shape of a quarter circle.
