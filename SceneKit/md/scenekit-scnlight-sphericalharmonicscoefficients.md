## Discussion

Spherical harmonic coefficients describe the distribution of light around a point in a format that can be used efficiently in real-time rendering. SceneKit supports spherical harmonics only for lights of the probe type.

The data is an 32-bit floating-point values, containing three noninterleaved data sets corresponding to the red, green, and blue sets of coefficients. SceneKit supports only level 2 spherical harmonics, so the array has 3 sets of 9 values, or 27 values total.
