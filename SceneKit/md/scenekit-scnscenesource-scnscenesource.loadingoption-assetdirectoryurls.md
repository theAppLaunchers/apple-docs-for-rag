static let assetDirectoryURLs: SCNSceneSource.LoadingOption
```

## Discussion

The value for this key is an NSArray object containing one or more NSURL objects, each of which references a directory.

A scene file may reference external resources, such as image files used as textures in material properties, using relative URL paths. When loading from a scene source, SceneKit first attempts to resolve these references relative to the directory containing the scene file. To search additional directories when loading, provide an array of URLs for this key and SceneKit searches them in order.

When working with a scene source constructed from an NSData object, you can use this option to provide locations in the filesystem for loading external resources.
