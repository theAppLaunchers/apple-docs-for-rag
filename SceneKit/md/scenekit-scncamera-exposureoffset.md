Instance Property

# exposureOffset

A logarithmic bias that adjusts the results of SceneKitâ€™s tone mapping operation, brightening or darkening the visible scene.

## Discussion

When using a High Dynamic Range (HDR) camera, SceneKit applies a process called *tone mapping* to translate the wide range of luminance values in the visible scene to the narrower range of brightness values that can be shown on a display. SceneKit determines a tone mapping curve from the minimumExposure, maximumExposure, exposureOffset, and whitePoint properties, along with a measure of scene luminance.

Use this property to bias the tone mapping curve. The default exposure offset is zero, specifying no bias. Positive values result in a brighter scene, and negative values result in a darker scene.

This property has no effect if the wantsHDR value is false.
