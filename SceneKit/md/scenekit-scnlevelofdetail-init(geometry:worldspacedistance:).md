Initializer

# init(geometry:worldSpaceDistance:)

Creates a level of detail with the specified geometry and threshold camera distance.

iOSiPadOSMac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.9+tvOSvisionOSwatchOS

``` source
convenience init(
    geometry: SCNGeometry?,
    worldSpaceDistance distance: CGFloat
)
```

## Parameters 

`geometry`  

The geometry to render for this level of detail, or `nil` if SceneKit should render no geometry at this level of detail.

`distance`  

The minimum distance from the current point of view for this level of detail to appear.

## Return Value

A level-of-detail object. You associate levels of detail with a SCNGeometry object using its levelsOfDetail property.

## Discussion

When rendering a geometry with associated levels of detail, SceneKit calculates the distance from the current point of view to the geometryâ€™s parent node, then renders the geometry for the SCNLevelOfDetail object with the smallest `distance` parameter greater than that distance.

If you pass `nil` for the geometry parameter, SceneKit renders no geometry for the level of detail. Creating a level-of-detail object with no geometry allows you to skip rendering costs entirely for an object when it would appear very far away or very small.
