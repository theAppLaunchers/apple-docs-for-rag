## Discussion

An array of constraint objects. Before rendering, SceneKit evaluates all constraints attached to a node hierarchy and adjusts node transformations appropriately.

Use the SCNLookAtConstraint class to make a node always point toward another node even as both are moved, or the SCNTransformConstraint class to apply arbitrary transformations at constraint evaluation time.
