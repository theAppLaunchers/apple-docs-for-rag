``` source
func hitTest(
    _ point: CGPoint,
    options: [SCNHitTestOption : Any]? = nil
) -> [SCNHitTestResult]
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`point`  

A point in the screen-space (view, layer, or GPU viewport) coordinate system of the scene renderer.

`options`  

A dictionary of options affecting the search. See Hit Testing Options Keys for acceptable values.

## Return Value

An array of SCNHitTestResult objects representing search results.

## Discussion

A 2D point in the rendered screen coordinate space can refer to any point along a line segment in the 3D scene coordinate space. Hit-testing is the process of finding elements of a scene located along this line segment. For example, you can use this method to find the geometry corresponding to a click event in a SceneKit view.
