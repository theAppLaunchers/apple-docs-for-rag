## Return Value

A new single node containing the combined geometries and materials of the node and its child node subtree.

## Discussion

Rendering complex node hierarchies can incur a performance cost. Each geometry and material requires a separate draw command to be sent to the GPU, and each draw command comes with a performance overhead. If you plan for a portion of your sceneâ€™s node hierarchy to remain static (with respect to itself, if not the rest of the scene), use this method to create a single node containing all elements of that node hierarchy that SceneKit can render using fewer draw commands.
