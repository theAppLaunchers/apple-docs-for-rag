## Discussion

An array of SCNGeometry objects.

A morpher blends between a base geometry, specified in the geometry property of the node the morpher is attached to, and one or more target geometries. The base geometry and all target geometries must be topologically identicalâ€”that is, they must contain the same number and structural arrangement of vertices.
