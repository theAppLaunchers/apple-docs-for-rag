## Discussion

With the default blend mode of SCNBlendMode.alpha, materials blend according to their alpha (opacity) valuesâ€”a pixel rendered with a higher alpha value appears more opaque than one with a lower alpha value. Change this property to create special effects. For example, the SCNBlendMode.add mode can make objects appear to glow.
