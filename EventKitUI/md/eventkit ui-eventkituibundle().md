## Discussion

A *bundle* is a directory with a standardized hierarchical structure that holds executable code and the resources used by that code. Bundles organize their contained resources into well-defined subdirectories.

By using a bundle object, you can access a bundleâ€™s resources without knowing the structure of the bundle. The bundle object provides a single interface for locating items, taking into account the bundle structure, user preferences, available localizations, and other relevant factors.
