## Overview

Presented modally, the event edit view controller provides a way for users to add new events, as well as edit or delete events from their calendar. New events are added to the userâ€™s default calendar unless they choose another calendar in the UI.

The controller includes delegates to receive a notification when the user saves an edit or deletes an event, or cancels from an edit session. The delegate must conform to EKEventEditViewDelegate.
