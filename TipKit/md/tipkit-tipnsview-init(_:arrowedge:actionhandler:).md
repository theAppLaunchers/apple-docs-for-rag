# init(\_:arrowEdge:actionHandler:)

Creates a tip view with an optional arrow.

macOS 15.0+

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
convenience init(
    _ tip: any Tip,
    arrowEdge: Edge? = nil,
    actionHandler: @escaping (Tips.Action) -> Void = { _ in }
)
```

## Parameters 

`tip`  

The tip to display.

`arrowEdge`  

The edge of the tip view that displays the arrow.

`actionHandler`  

The closure to perform when the user triggers a tipâ€™s action.

## Discussion

Use a `TipNSView` when you want to indicate the UI element to which the tip applies, but do not want to directly anchor the tip view to that element.
