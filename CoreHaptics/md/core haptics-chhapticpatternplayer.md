## Mentioned in 

Playing a single-tap haptic pattern

## Overview

Create instances of a pattern player through a CHHapticEngine object by calling a factory method such as makePlayer(with:). When you ask a pattern player to play a haptic pattern, the player submits those commands to the haptic engine on your behalf.

Use the advanced pattern player, CHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer, when your haptic pattern needs to change during playback, or when youâ€™d like to sync your haptic with a custom audio track. The advanced player allows your app to dynamically change haptic characteristics such as intensity and sharpness through dynamic parameters and parameter curves, capabilities not found in the standard player.
