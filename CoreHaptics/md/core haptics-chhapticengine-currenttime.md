## Discussion

This time applies to all haptic and audio events sent to and managed by the Core Haptics engine. Use the current time as a way to determine or track the start times of haptic and audio events, created as CHHapticEvent objects. It corresponds to the relativeTime and duration properties of haptic events.

Note

The Core Haptics engine time doesnâ€™t correlate to time used in media playback classes from other frameworks, such as AVAudioPlayer.
