protocol TransferRepresentation : Sendable
```

## Overview

Combine multiple existing transfer representations to compose a single transfer representation that describes how to transfer an item in multiple scenarios.

The following shows a `Greeting` type that transfers both as a `Codable` type and by proxy through its `message` string.

```
import UniformTypeIdentifiers

struct Greeting: Codable, Transferable {
    let message: String
    var displayInAllCaps: Bool = false

    static var transferRepresentation: some TransferRepresentation {
        CodableRepresentation(contentType: .greeting)
        ProxyRepresentation(exporting: \.message)
    }
}

extension UTType {
    static var greeting: UTType { .init(exportedAs: "com.example.greeting") }
}
```

## Topics

### Implementing a transfer representation

var body: Self.Body

A builder expression that describes the process of importing and exporting an item.

**Required**

associatedtype Body : TransferRepresentation

The transfer representation for the item.

**Required**

associatedtype Item : Transferable

The type of the item thatâ€™s being transferred.

**Required**

### Configuring exports

func exportingCondition((Self.Item) -> Bool) -> _ConditionalTransferRepresentation&lt;Self>

Prevents the system from exporting an item if it does not meet the supplied condition.

### Controlling visibility

func visibility(TransferRepresentationVisibility) -> some TransferRepresentation&lt;Self.Item> 

Specifies the kinds of apps and processes that can see an item in transit.

### Instance Methods

func suggestedFileName(String) -> some TransferRepresentation&lt;Self.Item> 

Provides a filename to use if the receiver chooses to write the item to disk.

func suggestedFileName((Self.Item) -> String?) -> some TransferRepresentation&lt;Self.Item> 

Provides a filename to use if the receiver chooses to write the item to disk.
