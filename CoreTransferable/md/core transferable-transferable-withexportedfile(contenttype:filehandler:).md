``` source
func withExportedFile(
    contentType: UTType?,
    fileHandler: (URL) async throws -> Result
) async throws -> Result
```

## Parameters 

`contentType`  

A content type of the requested file. If the content type is not provided, CoreTransferable creates a file from the first `TransferRepresentation` that supports export.

`fileHandler`  

A closure that accepts a file URL as a parameter. The file is written to a temporary destination and removed after the closure returns.

## Discussion

This converts a Transferable item into a temporary file, and removes it after `fileHandler` closure returns. The default implementation of this function is available to all types that conform to `Transferable` protocol.
