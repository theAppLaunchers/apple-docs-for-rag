Instance Property

# proactivelyLoadsVideo

A boolean value that indicates whether the Player downloads bytes before the user begins playback.

LivePhotosKit JS 1.3+

``` source
attribute Boolean proactivelyLoadsVideo;
```

## Discussion

Whether or not the Player downloads bytes at the provided videoSrc before the user begins playback.

If there are many Players on a page, a value of `false` enables configuration of videoSrc on all Players without forcing expensive downloads of each Playerâ€™s video asset.

If there are few Players on a page, a value of `true` decreases the warmup and loading time necessary after an attempt to initiate playback before playback actually begins.

This tradeoff is left to the developer, but in the interests of out-of-the-box scalability, this property defaults to `false`.
