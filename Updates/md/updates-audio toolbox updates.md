### Spatial audio with AUSpatialMixer

- Adjust the spatial mixer orientation to match someone’s head pose via compatible AirPods by setting the new kAudioUnitProperty_SpatialMixerEnableHeadTracking property to `true`. The system requires your app to have the com.apple.developer.coremotion.head-pose entitlement to observe this property.

- Tailor spatial mixing output according to a person’s personalized spatial audio profile that they configure in Settings by adding the com.apple.developer.spatial-audio.profile-access entitlement to your app.

- Instruct spatial mixing to ignore the new system spatial audio toggle in Control Center by adding the AVGameBypassSystemSpatialAudio key to your app’s `Info.plist`.
