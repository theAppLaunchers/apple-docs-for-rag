- Make symbols even more expressive with new animations. Find new ways to respond to peopleâ€™s input, convey status changes, and signal ongoing activity with WiggleSymbolEffect, RotateSymbolEffect, and BreatheSymbolEffect.

- Allow symbols to more intelligently transition between related variants with magic(fallback:). Slashes can now draw on and off, and badges can appear and disappear, or be replaced independently of the base symbol.

- Use repeat(_:) for new playback options for repeating animations. Apply a delay between repetitions, and use new, continuous repeat behavior with continuous to produce smoother animations when repeating indefinitely.
