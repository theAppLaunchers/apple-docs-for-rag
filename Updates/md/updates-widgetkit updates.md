### General

- Controls allow people to customize and configure Control Center, their Lock Screen, and the Action button with actions from your apps. Take advantage of ControlWidgetButton to execute an action and ControlWidgetToggle to toggle some state in your app.

- Accent views of widgets on iOS and iPadOS using widgetAccentable(_:).

- Provide context for when and where a widget is most relevant for surfacing in a Smart Stack with doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/widgetkit/widgetrelevances. Define context using a collection of doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/widgetkit/widgetrelevanceentry objects that work with existing TimelineProvider, AppIntentTimelineProvider, and IntentTimelineProvider protocols.

### Apple Watch

- Create interactive widgets on watchOS using a Button or Toggle to perform actions without launching your app.

- Use an AccessoryWidgetGroup container to provide up to three content views, optionally interactive, in a watchOS widget. Style AccessoryWidgetGroup content views using circular or roundedSquare.
