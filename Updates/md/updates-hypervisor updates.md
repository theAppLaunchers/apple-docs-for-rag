## June 2024

- Build your own virtual machine solutions with added support for nested virtualization in Apple silicon chips, and enable a hypervisor to run inside another virtual machine. Nested virtualization capabilities on a Mac with Apple silicon use a new exception level (EL), EL2, which the framework enables though several new methods, including hv_vm_config_set_el2_enabled(_:_:), and a number of enumeration constants that describe ARM system registers.

- Add support for virtualized ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) devices and provide an efficient mechanism to manage interrupt delivery to a virtual machine. Providing a GIC device reduces the custom code you need to write to emulate an interrupt controller.

- Add support for GIC hypervisor control system registers that GIC devices provide for nested virtualization support. Support for these registers allows hypervisors running in a virtual machine to inject interrupts to their guests.
