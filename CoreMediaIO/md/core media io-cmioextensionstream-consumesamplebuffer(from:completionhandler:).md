Consumes a sample buffer from a client.

Mac Catalyst 15.4+macOS 12.3+

``` source
func consumeSampleBuffer(
    from client: CMIOExtensionClient,
    completionHandler: @escaping (CMSampleBuffer?, UInt64, CMIOExtensionStream.DiscontinuityFlags, Bool, (any Error)?) -> Void
)
```

``` source
func consumeSampleBuffer(from client: CMIOExtensionClient) async throws -> (CMSampleBuffer, UInt64, CMIOExtensionStream.DiscontinuityFlags, Bool)
```

## Parameters 

`client`  

The client with a sample to process.

`completionHandler`  

A callback the system invokes with the following data:

`sampleBuffer`  
A sample buffer that contains the media sample to consume, or `nil` if an error occurs.

`sampleBufferSequenceNumber`  
The sequence number of the current sample.

`discontinuity`  
A flag that indicates if thereâ€™s a discontinuity in the stream.

`hasMoreSampleBuffers`  
A Boolean value that indicates whether there are more buffers available.

`error`  
An optional error. If an error occurs, it contains the details of the failure.
