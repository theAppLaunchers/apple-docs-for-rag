# deviceIsSuspended

A property key for a Boolean value that indicates whether the device is in a suspended state.

Mac Catalyst 15.4+macOS 12.3+

``` source
static let deviceIsSuspended: CMIOExtensionProperty
```

## Discussion

An example of when a device may be in a suspended state is when a user closes their laptop. While suspended, the device continues to respond to requests as if it were active, but the stream doesnâ€™t provide any data.

The property state for this property is a number that represents a Boolean value.
