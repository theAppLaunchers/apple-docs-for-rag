## Overview

Xcode discovers implementations of the `LibraryContentProvider` protocol in your project or workspace and examines their contents for items that it can add to the Xcode library. Add views by implementing the content providerâ€™s computed views property, and returning an array of LibraryItem instances initialized with the views you want to publish:

```
```

Add view modifiers by implementing the modifiers(base:) method and similarly returning an array of library items initialized with the modifiers you want to publish. For view modifiers, you also specify the type to which the modifiers apply:

```
```

For modifiers that you define in an extension to View, you can provide any view conformer as the `base`. For modifiers that you define on a particular view type, provide that type as the `base`.
