# iOS 16.1 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## Overview

The iOS 16.1 SDK provides support to develop apps for iPhone and iPad running iOS 16.1. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14.1 RC, available from Beta Software Downloads. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14.1, see Xcode 14.1 Release Notes.

### Home

#### Known issues

- You might receive an alert to turn on Wi-Fi when pairing a Matter accessory. (98460235)

  **Workaround:** Ensure your device is connected to your Wi-Fi network.

- Adjusting the color or color temperature might result in an unexpected color set on a Matter accessory. (98578966)

- Accessory details might not open if a Matter accessory is unreachable. (99232316)

- The device that initiates the pairing needs to use the same iCloud account as the home hub. Only the owner of a home, not an invited user, can pair Matter accessories. (76012945)

### Memory Allocation

#### Known Issues

- The system memory allocator `free` operation zeroes out all deallocated blocks in iOS 16.1 beta or later. Invalid accesses to free memory might result in new crashes or corruption, including:

  - Read-after-free bugs that previously observed the old contents of a block may now observe zeroes instead

  - Write-after-free bugs may now cause subsequent calls to `calloc` to return non-zero memory

  To debug these issues, use Address Sanitizer and Guard Malloc (see `libgmalloc(3)`). (97449075)

### StoreKit

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue where restoring transactions wouldnâ€™t prompt for authentication or restore any transactions if there was no App Store account signed in. (99506258)

- Fixed an issue where purchasing or restoring in-app transactions with hosted content would block new purchases or restores from processing. (100117681)
