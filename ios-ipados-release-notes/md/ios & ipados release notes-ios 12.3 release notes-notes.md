### Date and Time

#### New Features

- Support for the Reiwa (令和) era of the Japanese calendar, which began on May 1, 2019, is now available. The first year of Japanese-calendar era is represented as  “元年” (“Gannen”) instead of “1年”, except in the shorter numeric-style formats which typically also use the narrow era name; for example: “R1/05/01”.
