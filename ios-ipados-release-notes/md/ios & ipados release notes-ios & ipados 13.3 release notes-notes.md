# iOS & iPadOS 13.3 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## Overview

The iOS & iPadOS 13.3 SDK provides support for developing apps for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices running iOS & iPadOS 13.3. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 11.3 available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 11.3, see Xcode 11.3 Release Notes.

### Networking

#### New Features

- Certain top-level domains (TLDs) such as `.dev` and `.app` are now in the Foundation URLSession and NSURLConnection HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list. An app which uses URLSession to visit a matching URL will always navigate to the URL as `https://`, and never as cleartext `http://`. See the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Specification for more information about HSTS. (56247242)

### Safari

#### New Features

- Now supports NFC, USB, and Lightning FIDO2-compliant security keys in Safari, SFSafariViewController, and ASWebAuthenticationSession using the WebAuthn standard, on devices with the necessary hardware capabilities.
