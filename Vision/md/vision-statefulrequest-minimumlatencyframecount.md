Instance Property

# minimumLatencyFrameCount

The minimum number of frames that the request has to process before reporting any observations.

``` source
var minimumLatencyFrameCount: Int { get }
```

**Required** Default implementation provided.

## Discussion

The request provides this information after itâ€™s initialized with its required parameters.

Video-based requests often need a minimum number of frames before they can report any observations. For example, for movement detection that requires at least `5` frames, the minimumLatencyFrameCount for the request reports `5`, and after the request processes `5` frames, an observation returns the results.
