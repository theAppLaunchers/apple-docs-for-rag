## Overview

The Vision framework provides the ability to detect trajectories of objects in a video. The algorithm looks at the differences between frames of a video and identifies objects that travel along a parabolic path. A single object — like a bouncing ball — may produce multiple trajectories.

The sample code project shows you how to configure a trajectory detection request to analyze sample buffers. It explores how to set up a capture session to analyze a live-capture feed, and an asset reader to analyze a prerecorded video. When the sample app detects a trajectory, it illustrates it by displaying the detected path on the screen.

For more information about identifying trajectories, see Identifying Trajectories in Video.

### Configure the project and prepare your environment

You must run the sample code project on a physical device with an A12 processor or later.

The sample’s current configuration looks for a small object moving left to right in a video. Try the sample app by downloading and analyzing a prerecorded video of a person tossing a bean bag. For live capture, the sample app requires a stable scene with a fixed camera position and stationary background, so mount your iOS device to a tripod and keep it fixed on the field of view. You need to modify the trajectory request’s configuration based on your conditions when you use your own video.

### Create a trajectory request

Before the sample app creates a trajectory request, it gets sample buffers based on the selected source — live capture or a prerecorded video — in `CameraViewController`. After the AVCaptureSession or AVAssetReader retrieves a sample buffer, it passes to the `ContentAnalysisViewController`. The sample app creates a VNImageRequestHandler to perform the trajectory request with.

```
let visionHandler = VNImageRequestHandler(cmSampleBuffer: buffer,
                                          orientation: orientation,
                                          options: [:])
```

The sample app sets up a VNDetectTrajectoriesRequest object to define what the sample app looks for. It looks for trajectories after `1/60` second of video, and returns trajectories with a length of `6` or greater. Generally, developers use a shorter length for real-time apps, and longer lengths to observe finer and longer curves.

```
detectTrajectoryRequest = VNDetectTrajectoriesRequest(frameAnalysisSpacing: CMTime(value: 10, timescale: 600),
                                                      trajectoryLength: 6) { [weak self] (request: VNRequest, error: Error?) -> Void in

    guard let results = request.results as? [VNTrajectoryObservation] else {
        return
    }

    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self?.processTrajectoryObservation(results: results)
    }

}
```

After the sample app creates the `VNDetectTrajectoriesRequest`, it configures additional options that describe the radius of the object it’s looking for. To improve the efficiency of the analysis, it also specifies the region of interest.

```
// Following optional bounds by checking for the moving average radius
// of the trajectories the app is looking for.
detectTrajectoryRequest.objectMinimumNormalizedRadius = 10.0 / Float(1920.0)
detectTrajectoryRequest.objectMaximumNormalizedRadius = 30.0 / Float(1920.0)

// Help manage the real-time use case to improve the precision versus delay tradeoff.
detectTrajectoryRequest.targetFrameTime = CMTimeMake(value: 1, timescale: 60)

// The region of interest where the object is moving in the normalized image space.
detectTrajectoryRequest.regionOfInterest = normalizedFrame
```

After the sample app configures the trajectory request for the buffer, it processes the list of VNTrajectoryObservation results.

### Process the trajectory observation results

The sample app configuration targets the prerecorded video from the configuration section. The `VNDetectTrajectoriesRequest` follows objects moving on a parabolic path, and requires more than a single data point (trajectory length). After a request gathers enough data points to recognize the trajectory — a length of at least 5 — it passes the observation results that contain the trajectory information.

The first step in processing the results involves filtering the `VNTrajectoryObservation` based on the following conditions:

- The trajectory moves from left to right.

- The trajectory starts in the first half of the region of interest.

- The trajectory length increases to `8`, which indicates a throw instead of smaller movements.

- The trajectory contains a parabolic equation constant `a`, less than or equal to `0`, and implies there are either straight lines or downward-facing lines.

- The trajectory confidence is greater than `0.9`.

When the results meet the above conditions, the sample app deems the observation a valid trajectory. The sample app confirms the trajectory and makes any necessary correction to the path. If a left-to-right moving trajectory begins too far from a fixed region, the sample extrapolates it back to the region by using the available quadratic equation coefficients.

```
for trajectory in results {
    // Filter the trajectory.
    if filterParabola(trajectory: trajectory) {
        // Verify and correct an incomplete path.
        trajectoryView.points = correctTrajectoryPath(trajectoryToCorrect: trajectory)

        // Display a transition.
        trajectoryView.performTransition(.fadeIn, duration: 0.05)

        // Determine the size of the moving object that the app tracks.
        print("The object's moving average radius: \(trajectory.movingAverageRadius)")
    }
}
```

The sample app displays valid trajectories on the screen with particle effects by using SpriteKit.
