## Overview

This abstract superclass forms the basis of image alignment or registration output. You receive its subclasses, such as VNImageTranslationAlignmentObservation and VNImageHomographicAlignmentObservation, by performing specific registration requests. Donâ€™t create one of these classes yourself.
