``` source
class VNGeneratePersonSegmentationRequest
```

## Overview

Perform this request to detect and generate an image mask for a person in an image. The request returns the resulting image mask in an instance of VNPixelBufferObservation.

## Topics

### Creating a Request

init()

Creates a generate person segmentation request.

init(completionHandler: VNRequestCompletionHandler?)

Creates a generate person segmentation request with a completion handler.

### Configuring the Request

var outputPixelFormat: OSType

The pixel format of the output image.

var qualityLevel: VNGeneratePersonSegmentationRequest.QualityLevel

A value that indicates how the request balances accuracy and performance.

enum QualityLevel

Constants that define the levels of quality for a person segmentation request.

### Accessing the Results

var results: [VNPixelBufferObservation]?

The results of the segmentation request.

class VNPixelBufferObservation

An object that represents an image that an image-analysis request produces.

### Identifying Request Revisions

let VNGeneratePersonSegmentationRequestRevision1: Int

A constant for specifying revision 1 of the person segmentation generation request.

### Instance Methods

func supportedOutputPixelFormats() throws -> [NSNumber]

Returns a list of output pixel formats that the request supports.
