## Discussion

The rectangle is normalized to the dimensions of the processed image. Its origin is specified relative to the imageâ€™s lower-left corner.

The default value is `{ { 0, 0 }, { 1, 1 } }`.

Important

The request will fail to perform if you set this property to a rectangle outside the normalized coordinate space.
