``` source

```

## Overview

Adopt this protocol for potentially long-running Vision requests to provide information about progress throughout processing. For example, you can use the optional progressHandler to update the user interface, provide a percentage of completion, or process partial results.

Note

The Vision framework may call the progress handler on a different dispatch queue from the thread on which you initiated the original request, so ensure that your handler can execute asynchronously, in a thread-safe manner.

## Topics
