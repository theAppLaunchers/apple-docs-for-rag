Initializer

# init(cmSampleBuffer:depthData:orientation:options:)

Creates a request handler that performs requests on an image in a sample buffer that contains depth data.

iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 17.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
init(
    cmSampleBuffer sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer,
    depthData: AVDepthData,
    orientation: CGImagePropertyOrientation,
    options: [VNImageOption : Any] = [:]
)
```

## Parameters 

`sampleBuffer`  

The sample buffer that contains the image to analyze. If the sample buffer doesnâ€™t contain an image buffer with image data, the system raises an error.

`depthData`  

The depth data to associate with the image.

`orientation`  

The EXIF orientation of the image.

`options`  

A dictionary that specifies auxiliary information about the image.

## Discussion

Sample buffers may contain metadata, like the camera intrinsics. Vision algorithms that support this metadata use it in their analysis, unless overwritten by the options you specify.

Important

Use a physical device to perform your testing. Performing requests in Simulator may produce inaccurate results due to the inability of Core Image to render certain pixel formats in this environment.
