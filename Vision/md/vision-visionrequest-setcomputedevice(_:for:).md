``` source
mutating func setComputeDevice(
    _ computeDevice: MLComputeDevice?,
    for computeStage: ComputeStage
)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`computeDevice`  

The compute device to assign to the compute stage.

`computeStage`  

The compute stage.

## Discussion

If the parameter `computeDevice` is \`nil\`, the framework removes any explicit compute device assignment and allows the framework to select the device.

Configure any compute device for a given compute stage. When performing a request, the system makes a validity check. Use supportedComputeStageDevices to get valid compute devices for a requestâ€™s compute stages.
