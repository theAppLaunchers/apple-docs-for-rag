```

## Overview

Use this type of request to track the bounding boxes around objects previously identified in an image. Vision attempts to locate the same object from the input observation throughout the sequence.

## Topics

### Initializing an Object Tracking Request

init(detectedObjectObservation: VNDetectedObjectObservation)

Creates a new object tracking request with a detected object observation.

init(detectedObjectObservation: VNDetectedObjectObservation, completionHandler: VNRequestCompletionHandler?)

Creates a new object tracking request with a detected object observation.

### Identifying Request Revisions

let VNTrackObjectRequestRevision2: Int

A constant for specifying revision 2 of the object tracking request.

let VNTrackObjectRequestRevision1: Int

A constant for specifying revision 1 of the object tracking request.
