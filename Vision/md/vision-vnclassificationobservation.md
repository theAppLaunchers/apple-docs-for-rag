``` source
class VNClassificationObservation
```

## Overview

This type of observation results from performing a VNCoreMLRequest image analysis with a Core ML model whose role is classification (rather than prediction or image-to-image processing). Vision infers that an MLModel object is a classifier model if that model predicts a single feature. That is, the modelâ€™s modelDescription object has a non-`nil` value for its predictedFeatureName property.

## Topics

### Determining Classification

var identifier: String

Classification label identifying the type of observation.

### Measuring Confidence and Precision

var hasPrecisionRecallCurve: Bool

A Boolean variable indicating whether the observation contains precision and recall curves.

func hasMinimumPrecision(Float, forRecall: Float) -> Bool

Determines whether the observation for a specific recall has a minimum precision value.

func hasMinimumRecall(Float, forPrecision: Float) -> Bool

Determines whether the observation for a specific precision has a minimum recall value.
