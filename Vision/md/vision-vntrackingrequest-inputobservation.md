## Discussion

Providing an observation not returned from a tracker, such as a user-defined observation, begins a new tracker for the sequence. Providing an observation that was returned from a tracker continues the use of that tracker, to track the region to the next frame.

In general, unless specified in the requestâ€™s documentation or header file, you must define the rectangle in normalized coordinates, with the origin at the lower-left corner.
