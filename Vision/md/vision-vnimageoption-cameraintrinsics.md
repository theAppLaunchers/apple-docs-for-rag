## Discussion

The camera intrinsics matrix is a CFData instance containing a matrix_float3x3, which is a column-major matrix:

`fx` and `fy` are the focal length in pixels. For square pixels, they have the same value.

`ox` and `oy` are the coordinates of the principal point. The origin is the upper-left corner of the frame.
