## Overview

The framework provides the detected hand pose as a `VNIdentifiedPointsObservation`.

## Topics

### Configuring the Request

var maximumHandCount: Int

The maximum number of hands to detect in an image.

### Determining Supported Joints

var supportedJointNames: [VNHumanHandPoseObservation.JointName]

Retrieves the supported joint names.

class func supportedJointNames(forRevision: Int) throws -> [VNHumanHandPoseObservation.JointName]

Retrieves the supported joint names for a revision.

Deprecated

var supportedJointsGroupNames: [VNHumanHandPoseObservation.JointsGroupName]

Retrieves the supported joint group names.

class func supportedJointsGroupNames(forRevision: Int) throws -> [VNHumanHandPoseObservation.JointsGroupName]
