``` source
class VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest
```

## Overview

By default, a face landmarks request first locates all faces in the input image, then analyzes each to detect facial features.

If youâ€™ve already located all the faces in an image, or want to detect landmarks in only a subset of the faces in the image, set the inputFaceObservations property to an array of VNFaceObservation objects representing the faces you want to analyze. You can either use face observations output by a VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest or manually create VNFaceObservation instances with the bounding boxes of the faces you want to analyze.

## Topics

### Configuring a Face Landmarks Request

protocol VNFaceObservationAccepting

An image analysis request that operates on face observations.

### Accessing the Results

var results: [VNFaceObservation]?

The results of the face landmarks request.

class VNFaceObservation

Face or facial-feature information that an image analysis request detects.

### Locating Face Landmarks

var constellation: VNRequestFaceLandmarksConstellation

A variable that describes how a face landmarks request orders or enumerates the resulting features.

enum VNRequestFaceLandmarksConstellation

An enumeration of face landmarks in a constellation object.

### Identifying Request Revisions

class func revision(Int, supportsConstellation: VNRequestFaceLandmarksConstellation) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether a revision supports a constellation.

let VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequestRevision3: Int

A constant for specifying revision 3 of the face landmarks detection request.

let VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequestRevision2: Int

A constant for specifying revision 2 of the face landmarks detection request.

let VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequestRevision1: Int

A constant for specifying revision 1 of the face landmarks detection request.
