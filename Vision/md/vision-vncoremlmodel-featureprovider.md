## Discussion

This optional object conforms to the MLFeatureProvider protocol that the model uses to predict inputs that are not supplied by Vision. Vision provides the MLModel with the image for the inputImageFeatureName via the `VNRequestHandler`.

A feature provider is necessary for models that have more than one required input. Models with only one image input wonâ€™t use the feature provider.
