## Overview

A rectangle-detection request locates regions of an image with rectangular shape, like credit cards, business cards, documents, and signs. The request returns its observations in the form of RectangleObservation objects, and contains normalized coordinates of bounding boxes containing a rectangle.

Use this type of request to find the bounding boxes of rectangles in an image. Vision returns observations for rectangles found in all orientations and sizes, along with a confidence level to indicate how likely it is that the observation contains an actual rectangle.

To further configure or restrict the types of rectangles found, set properties on the request specifying a range of aspect ratios, sizes, and quadrature tolerance.

## Topics

### Creating a request

init(DetectRectanglesRequest.Revision?)

Creates a rectangle-detection request.

### Getting the revision

let revision: DetectRectanglesRequest.Revision

The algorithm or implementation the request uses.

static let supportedRevisions: [DetectRectanglesRequest.Revision]

The collection of revisions the request supports.

enum Revision

A type that describes the algorithm or implementation that the request performs.

### Inspecting a request

var maximumAspectRatio: Float

The maximum aspect ratio of the rectangle to detect.

var maximumObservations: Int

The maximum number of rectangles Vision returns.

var minimumAspectRatio: Float

The minimum aspect ratio of the rectangle(s) to detect.

var minimumConfidence: Float

The minimum acceptable confidence level for detected rectangles.

var minimumSize: Float

The minimum size of the rectangle to be detected, as a proportion of the smallest dimension.

var quadratureToleranceDegrees: Float

The maximum number of degrees a rectangle corner angle can deviate from 90Â°.
