iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Xcode 15.0+

## Overview

Note

This sample code project is associated with WWDC23 session 111241: Explore 3D body pose and person segmentation in Vision.

### Configure the sample code project

Before you run the sample code project in Xcode, ensure youâ€™re using an iOS device with an A12 chip or later. The input image should have all limbs of the subject visible.

Note

Due to a behavior change with `cameraOriginMatrix` API, if this sample project is run on a device on a build earlier than beta 3, camera position will be rotated 180 degrees.
