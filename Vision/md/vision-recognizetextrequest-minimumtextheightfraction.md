## Discussion

Specify a floating-point number relative to the image height. For example, to limit recognition to text thatâ€™s half of the image height, use `0.5`. Increasing the size reduces memory consumption and expedites recognition with the tradeoff of ignoring text smaller than the minimum height. The default value is `1/32`, or `0.03125`.
