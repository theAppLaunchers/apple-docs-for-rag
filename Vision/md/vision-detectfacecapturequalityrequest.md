# DetectFaceCaptureQualityRequest

A request that produces a floating-point number that represents the capture quality of a face in a photo.

``` source
struct DetectFaceCaptureQualityRequest
```

## Overview

This request produces a collection of FaceObservation objects with the property `FaceObservation/faceCaptureQuality` set to a value ranging from `0` to `1`. Faces with quality closer to `1` are better lit, sharper, and more centrally positioned than faces with quality closer to `0`.

If you donâ€™t execute the request, or the request fails, the property `FaceObservation/faceCaptureQuality` is `nil`.

## Topics

### Creating a request

init(DetectFaceCaptureQualityRequest.Revision?)

Creates a face capture quality request.

### Getting the revision

let revision: DetectFaceCaptureQualityRequest.Revision

The algorithm or implementation the request uses.

static let supportedRevisions: [DetectFaceCaptureQualityRequest.Revision]

The collection of revisions the request supports.

enum Revision

A type that describes the algorithm or implementation that the request performs.

### Inspecting a request

var inputFaceObservations: [FaceObservation]?

An array of face-observation objects to process as part of the request.
