Instance Method

# SetInputLatency

Sets the input latency of the clock device.

DriverKit 21.0+

``` source
kern_return_t SetInputLatency(uint32_t in_latency);
```

## Parameters 

`in_latency`  

The input latency value to set.

## Return Value

kIOReturnSuccess on success, or another value if an error occurs. For a list of error codes, see Error Codes.

## Discussion

Drivers can change the input latency of the clock device dynamically. If successful, changing the available input latency sends a notification to the host to update the object state.

This method synchronizes by using the work queue created by the object.
