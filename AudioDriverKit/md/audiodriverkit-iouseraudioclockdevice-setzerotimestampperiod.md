Instance Method

# SetZeroTimeStampPeriod

Sets the zero time stamp of the clock device.

DriverKit 21.0+

``` source
kern_return_t SetZeroTimeStampPeriod(uint32_t in_zts_period);
```

## Parameters 

`in_zts_period`  

The zero time stamp period.

## Return Value

kIOReturnSuccess on success, or another value if an error occurs. For a list of error codes, see Error Codes.

## Discussion

The parameter indicates the number of sample frames the host can expect between successive timestamps returned from GetCurrentZeroTimestamp. In other words, if GetCurrentZeroTimestamp returns a sample time of `x`, the host can expect that the next valid timestamp it recieves will be `x + in_zero_timestamp_period`.

Only set this value during the PerformDeviceConfigurationChange call. If you need to change the value at any other time, call RequestDeviceConfigurationChange. This allows I/O to stop and calls PerformDeviceConfigurationChange, during which you can set the value.

This method synchronizes by using the work queue created by the object.
