Instance Method

# GetZeroTimestampPeriod

Gets the zero time stamp of the clock device.

DriverKit 21.0+

``` source
uint32_t GetZeroTimestampPeriod();
```

## Return Value

The zero time stamp of the clock device.

## Discussion

The return value indicates the number of sample frames the host can expect between successive timestamps returned from GetCurrentZeroTimestamp. In other words, if GetCurrentZeroTimestamp returns a sample time of `x`, the host can expect that the next valid timestamp it recieves will be `x +` GetZeroTimestampPeriod.

This method synchronizes by using the work queue created by the object.
