Instance Method

# GetSupportsPrewarming

Returns a Boolean value that indicates clock deviceâ€™s support for prewarming.

DriverKit 21.0+

``` source
bool GetSupportsPrewarming();
```

## Return Value

`true` if the clock device supports prewarming; `false` otherwise.

## Discussion

A device that supports prewarming can enable a minimal state that allows it to be ready to start audio I/O immediately on demand.

This method synchronizes by using the work queue created by the object.
