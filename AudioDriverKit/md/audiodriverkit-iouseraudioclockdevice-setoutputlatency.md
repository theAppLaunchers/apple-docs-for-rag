Instance Method

# SetOutputLatency

Sets the output latency of the clock device.

DriverKit 21.0+

``` source
kern_return_t SetOutputLatency(uint32_t in_latency);
```

## Parameters 

`in_latency`  

The output latency value to set.

## Return Value

kIOReturnSuccess on success, or another value if an error occurs. For a list of error codes, see Error Codes.

## Discussion

Drivers can change the output latency of the clock device dynamically. If successful, changing the available output latency sends a notification to the host to update the object state.

This method synchronizes by using the work queue created by the object.
