## Discussion

The element selects one of possibly many items in the section of the object in which to look for the property. Element numbers begin with the main element, `0`, and increase sequentially.

Elements are particular to an instance of a class, meaning that two instances can have different numbers of elements in the same scope. Thereâ€™s no inheritance of elements.
