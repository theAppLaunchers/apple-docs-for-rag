Instance Property

# metalDeviceRegistryID

Requests the processor use the provided Metal device for processing.

macOS 15.0+

``` source
optional var metalDeviceRegistryID: UInt64 { get set }
```

## Discussion

This optional property requests that MERAWProcessor use `MTLDevice` corresponding to this ID for any Metal-based processing. This is optional and doesnâ€™t need to be implemented if the processor does not use Metal.
