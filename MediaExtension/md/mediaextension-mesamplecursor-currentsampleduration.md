# currentSampleDuration

The decode duration of the sample at the current position.

macOS 14.0+

var currentSampleDuration: CMTime { get }
```

## Discussion

This value is indefinite if the system needs to advance the sample past its current position to determine the decode duration. This can occur with streaming formats such as MPEG-2 transport streams.
