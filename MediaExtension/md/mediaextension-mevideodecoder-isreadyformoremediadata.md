Instance Property

# isReadyForMoreMediaData

A Boolean value that indicates the readiness of the decoder to accept more sample buffers.

macOS 14.0+

``` source
var isReadyForMoreMediaData: Bool { get }
```

**Required**

## Discussion

Video decoders which operate asynchronously often have a fixed capacity for buffers in flight in the decoder. This property allows the decoder to signal to Video Toolbox that its internal buffers are full and it canâ€™t accept more samples. The decoder needs to use MEVideoDecoderReadyForMoreMediaDataDidChangeNotification to notify Video Toolbox when this property changes.
