Instance Property

# extendedLanguageTag

A string that indicates the language tag associated with the track, as an IETF BCP 47 (RFC 4646) language identifier.

macOS 14.0+

``` source
var extendedLanguageTag: String? { get set }
```

## Discussion

`MediaToolbox` uses this property to group similar language tracks together or to match audio and caption tracks. Set this value to `nil` if the track doesnâ€™t have a language tag.
