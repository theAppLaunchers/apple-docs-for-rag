# Configuring Exposure Notifications

Define how Exposure Notifications work for a region by assigning server-based key-value pairs.

## Overview

The configuration fields listed below define the behavior for Exposure Notifications features such as exposure matching, Exposure Risk Value (ERV) calculation, and messaging for regions managed by a Public Health Authority (PHA). These values can be changed by using the server-to-server API or by contacting Apple to request a change. PHAs that only support Exposure Notifications Express can also change these values by logging into Apple Business Register (ABR).

Note

To learn more about using these keys with the Exposure Notifications server-to-server API, see Changing Configuration Values Using the Server‑to‑Server API.

Some keys are relevant to all Exposure Notifications behavior, while some keys are only used by Exposure Notifications Express. Keys used to display information to users, to customize the user interface, to adjust exposure calculations, and to configure test verification servers are only used by Exposure Notifications Express. The other values are used by both Exposure Notifications Express and Exposure Notifications apps.

Certain keys are marked as Required, and some are also marked Localizable, as noted in bold in the lists below.

For keys marked Required, a PHA must configure these values for a region before it can go live with Exposure Notifications, but you don’t need to include required keys in every server-to-server API request. If a required field already has a valid value, requests only need to include that key when requesting a change to that field.

Using keys marked Localizable, you can provide different values for different languages by appending an underscore followed by the ISO two-letter language code, then another underscore, and then the ISO two-letter country code for the region. For example, to provide a localized value of `agencyDisplayName` for French-Canadians, use the key `agencyDisplayName_FR_CA`. When using the server-to-server API, you can provide multiple localized versions of the same key in the same request. In ABR, localizable fields provide a button that allows you to enter additional localized values.

### Specify API Version

Exposure Notifications’ APIs are available in two versions. Version 1 requires a client app to function, while Version 2 — available on iOS 13.7 and later — works both with a client app or without an app by using Exposure Notifications Express.

`enVersion`  
An unsigned 8-bit integer that determines whether an app uses version 1 or 2 of the Exposure Notifications framework.

Note

Keys you use to display information to users, customize the UI, adjust exposure calculations, and configure test verification servers are only used by Exposure Notifications Express, including any field that takes a color, image, or URL, or that includes `header`, `message`, or `text` as part of its name.

### Set Region Information

A PHA can manage more than one region and can configure each region with different values. These values allow you to change region-specific information:

### Set Exposure Classifications

These keys define values that set the calculation threshold for customizable exposure classifications in Exposure Notifications Express. A PHA can define up to four classifications. If a PHA creates more than one classification, they will be checked in order, only moving on to the next classification if the threshold is not met.

Replace the trailing `X` in the key names below with a number from 1 to 4 to specify which classification’s value to change. For example, to change the Exposure Details Body for the second exposure classification, you would use the key `exposureDetailsBodyText_2`. Setting any threshold field to a value of 0 disables its notification.
