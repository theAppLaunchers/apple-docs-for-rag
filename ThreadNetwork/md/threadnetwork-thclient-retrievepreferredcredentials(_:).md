## Discussion

Concurrency note

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
func preferredCredentials() async throws -> THCredentials
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

When you call this method, an alert appears asking for user permission to access credentials.

Call the method as follows:

```
func obtainPreferredCredentials() async -> (cred: THCredentials? , err: Error? ) {
    let client = THClient()
    var credential: THCredentials?
    var err:Error?
    do {
        credential = try await client.preferredCredentials()
    } catch {
        err = error
    }
    return (credential, err)
}
```
