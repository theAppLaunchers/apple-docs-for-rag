## Discussion

Concurrency note

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
func allCredentials() async throws -> Set
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

The framework identifies the developer by the team ID. When calling this method, you receive credentials for your team ID only.

Call the method as follows:

```
func obtainAllCredentials() async -> (Set?, Error?) {
    let client = THClient()
    var credentials: Set?
    var err:Error?
    do {
        credentials = try await client.allCredentials()
    } catch {
        err = error
    }
    return (credentials, err)
}
```
