Concurrency note

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
func credentials(forBorderAgentID borderAgentID: Data) async throws -> THCredentials
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

The framework identifies the developer by the team ID. When calling this method, you receive credentials for your team ID only.

Call the method as follows:

```
func obtainCredentials(borderAgentID: Data) async -> (cred: THCredentials? ,err: Error? ) {
    let client = THClient()
    var credential: THCredentials?
    var err:Error?
    do {
        credential = try await client.credentials(forBorderAgentID: borderAgentID as Data)
    } catch {
        err = error
    }
    return (credential, err)
}
```
