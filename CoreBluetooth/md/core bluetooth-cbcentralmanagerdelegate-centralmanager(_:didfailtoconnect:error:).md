iOS 5.0+iPadOS 5.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.7+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
optional func centralManager(
    _ central: CBCentralManager,
    didFailToConnect peripheral: CBPeripheral,
    error: (any Error)?
)
```

## Parameters 

`central`  

The central manager that provides this information.

`peripheral`  

The peripheral that failed to connect.

`error`  

The cause of the failure, or `nil` if no error occurred.

## Discussion

The manager invokes this method when a connection initiated with the connect(_:options:) method fails to complete. Because connection attempts donâ€™t time out, a failed connection usually indicates a transient issue, in which case you may attempt connecting to the peripheral again.
