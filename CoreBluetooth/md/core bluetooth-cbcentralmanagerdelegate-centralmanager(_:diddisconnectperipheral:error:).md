iOS 5.0+iPadOS 5.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.7+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
optional func centralManager(
    _ central: CBCentralManager,
    didDisconnectPeripheral peripheral: CBPeripheral,
    error: (any Error)?
)
```

## Parameters 

`central`  

The central manager that provides this information.

`peripheral`  

The now-disconnected peripheral.

`error`  

The cause of the failure, or `nil` if no error occurred.

## Discussion

The manager invokes this method when disconnecting a peripheral previously connected with the connect(_:options:) method. The error parameter contains the reason for the disconnection, unless the disconnect resulted from a call to cancelPeripheralConnection(_:). After this method executes, the peripheral deviceâ€™s CBPeripheralDelegate object receives no further method calls.

All services, characteristics, and characteristic descriptors a peripheral become invalidated after it disconnects.
