## Discussion

When the peripheral manager receives a request from a connected central to read or write a characteristicâ€™s value, it calls the peripheralManager(_:didReceiveRead:) or peripheralManager(_:didReceiveWrite:) method of its delegate object. To respond to the corresponding read or write request, you call this method whenever you recevie one of these delegate method callbacks.
