## Discussion

Check this property in your implementation of the delegate methods centralManagerDidUpdateState(_:) and peripheralManagerDidUpdateState(_:) to determine whether your app can use Core Bluetooth. You can also use it to check the appâ€™s authorization status before creating a CBManager instance.

The initial value of this property is CBManagerAuthorization.notDetermined.
