## Discussion

Use this property to retrieve a human-readable name of the peripheral. A peripheral may have two different name types: one that the device advertises and another that the device publishes in its database as its Bluetooth low energy Generic Access Profile (GAP) device name. If a peripheral has both types of names, this property returns its GAP device name.
