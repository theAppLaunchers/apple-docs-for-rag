    didConnect peripheral: CBPeripheral
)
```

## Parameters 

`central`  

The central manager that provides this information.

`peripheral`  

The now-connected peripheral.

## Discussion

The manager invokes this method when a call to connect(_:options:) succeeds. You typically implement this method to set the peripheralâ€™s delegate and discover its services.
