## Discussion

The value of this property represents the unique identifier of the peer. The first time a local manager encounters a peer, the system assigns the peer a UUID, represented by a new UUID object. Peers use UUID instances to identify themselves, instead of by the CBUUID objects that identify a peripheralâ€™s services, characteristics, and descriptors.
