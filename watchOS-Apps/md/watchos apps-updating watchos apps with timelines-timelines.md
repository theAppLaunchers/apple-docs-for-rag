# Updating watchOS apps with timelines

Seamlessly schedule updates to your user interface, even while it’s inactive.

## Overview

When you schedule periodic updates to your user interface with TimelineView, updates continue to run even when your app is in the ScenePhase.background or ScenePhase.inactive state, making this an ideal choice for keeping a watchOS app up-to-date while in the Always On state. Additionally, you can use a `TimelineView` to drive other changes — such as animation — when your app is running in the foreground.

### Set up the timeline

Specify the part of your user interface that receives periodic updates using a `TimelineView`.

```
var body: some View {
    VStack {

        // Use a timeline to recalculate the value every minute.
        `TimelineView`(EveryMinuteTimelineSchedule()) { context in
            // Display the current amount of caffeine in the user's body.
            Text(coffeeData.mgCaffeineString(atDate: context.date) + " mg")
                .font(.body)
                .fontWeight(.bold)
                .foregroundColor(colorForCaffeineDose())
        }

        // Lay out static views here.
        Text("Current Caffeine Dose")
            .font(.footnote)

        Divider()
        ...
}
```

The `TimelineView` structure takes a schedule that determines when the system makes updates. It also takes a ViewBuilder that defines the updatable content. The system then calls the view builder, passing the context for each update.

The TimelineView.Context instance contains both the time and the current TimelineView.Context.Cadence for the updates. When creating the updatable content for the `TimelineView`, use the time from the context, not the current system time. When in Always On, the system may request views up to 5 minutes in the future.

The cadence also indicates the current maximum rate for updates that the `TimelineView` receives:

TimelineView.Context.Cadence.live  
Receives high-frequency updates that are suitable for driving animation.

TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds  
Receives up to one update per second.

TimelineView.Context.Cadence.minutes  
Receives up to one update per minute.

The cadence can change from update to update. Always check the current value and hide information that isn’t relevant. For example, a timer app may show the time remaining in minutes, seconds, and hundredths of a second when it receives updates at the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.live` frequency. It can also play animation at that frequency.

When the updates drop to the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds` frequency, the app hides the hundredths of seconds and swaps the animation for a static image. The countdown only shows minutes and seconds.

If the frequency drops to `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.minutes`, the app also hides the seconds and only shows the time remaining to the nearest minute.

### Specify the schedule

When you create a `TimelineView`, you must specify the update schedule, which is an instance that adopts the TimelineSchedule protocol. While you can create your own custom schedules, SwiftUI provides schedules for many common use cases.

The system attempts to trigger updates based on the schedule, but it can delay or defer an update based on the system’s current state. Additionally, if the schedule is more frequent than the current cadence, the system throttles the updates to the cadence.

Common schedules include:

EveryMinuteTimelineSchedule  
A schedule to update the `TimelineView` every minute. These updates align with the system clock. For example, if the schedule starts at 1:00 pm, you’d get updates at 1:01, 1:02, 1:03, and so on.

PeriodicTimelineSchedule  
A schedule to update your interface at a regular, repeating interval. When you create this schedule, you specify the starting time and the interval between updates.

AnimationTimelineSchedule  
A schedule to create a `TimelineView` instance with high-frequency updates for animated content. When you create the schedule, you can set both the minimum interval and a Boolean value that indicates whether the animation is currently paused. If you don’t set a minimum interval, the system picks an appropriate update interval. Additionally, it only updates the view when the paused parameter is false.

ExplicitTimelineSchedule  
A schedule to specify a list of update times. For example, an app that plays audiobooks might schedule updates for the beginning of each chapter. When you create an explicit timeline, you pass a Sequence, such as an Array of Date instances. The system updates the `TimelineView` at the time specified by each date in the sequence.

### Update during always on

You can use timeline views to update your watchOS app while it’s in the Always On state; however, you must be able to specify the view’s contents given a `Date` instance for a time in the future. To improve performance, the system may ask for views up to 5 minutes in the future. For example, an egg timer could use a `TimelineView` to display the time remaining during Always On because it can calculate the amount of time remaining given any arbitrary time in the future.

When your app is active and in the foreground, the timeline schedule runs in the TimelineScheduleMode.normal mode, and your `TimelineView` can receive updates at the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.live` cadence. When your app transitions into Always On, the timeline schedule also transitions into the TimelineScheduleMode.lowFrequency mode, the cadence generally drops, and the system may batch-load future updates.

Note

In the Always On state, apps running a background session may not need to use a `TimelineView` to update their user interface. Any changes the app makes while running in the background continue to update its interface; however, to preserve battery life, the system only refreshes the user interface about once per second. For more information, see Designing your app for the Always On state.

While the actual cadence can vary depending on the requested schedule and the current state of the system, apps generally receive an update frequency based on whether they have background runtime or are inactive, frontmost apps.

Apps with background runtime receive updates at the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds` frequency. This would include apps with an active background session (like workout or background audio apps) or apps executing a background refresh task.

Inactive apps receive updates as long as they remain in the frontmost state, generally at the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.minutes` frequency. However, if you request a short burst of updates at the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds` frequency, the system provides that cadence if possible.

For example, an egg timer could use an `ExplicitTimelineSchedule` to set up per-minute updates for most of the countdown, and switch to per-second updates for the last minute. If conditions permit, the system provides `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds` updates for the last minute.
