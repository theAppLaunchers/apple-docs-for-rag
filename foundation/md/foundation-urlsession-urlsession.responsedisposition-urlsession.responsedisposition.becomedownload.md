## Discussion

When used with the completion handler from urlSession(_:dataTask:didReceive:completionHandler:), this disposition converts the data task to a download task. This will result in your delegateâ€™s urlSession(_:dataTask:didBecome:) being called to provide you with the new download task that supersedes the current task.
