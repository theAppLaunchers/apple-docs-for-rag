Accessing cached data

## Discussion

If your app doesnâ€™t have special caching requirements or constraints, the default shared cache instance should be acceptable. Alternatively, you can create a custom URLCache object and set it as the shared cache instance (use `+[NSURLCache setSharedURLCache]` in Objective-C). You should do so before making any calls to this method.
