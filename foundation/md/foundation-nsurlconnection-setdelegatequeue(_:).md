``` source
func setDelegateQueue(_ queue: OperationQueue?)
```

## Parameters 

`queue`  

The operation queue to use when calling delegate methods.

## Discussion

By default, a connection is scheduled on the current thread in the default mode when it is created. If you create a connection with the init(request:delegate:startImmediately:) method and provide false for the `startImmediately` parameter, you can instead schedule the connection on an operation queue before starting it with the start() method.

You cannot reschedule a connection after it has started.

It is an error to schedule delegate method calls with both this method and the schedule(in:forMode:) method.

func unschedule(from: RunLoop, forMode: RunLoop.Mode)
