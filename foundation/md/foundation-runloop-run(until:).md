Runs the loop until the specified date, during which time it processes data from all attached input sources.

``` source
func run(until limitDate: Date)
```

## Parameters 

`limitDate`  

The date up until which to run.

## Discussion

If no input sources or timers are attached to the run loop, this method exits immediately; otherwise, it runs the receiver in the `NSDefaultRunLoopMode` by repeatedly invoking run(mode:before:) until the specified expiration date.

Manually removing all known input sources and timers from the run loop is not a guarantee that the run loop will exit. macOS can install and remove additional input sources as needed to process requests targeted at the receiverâ€™s thread. Those sources could therefore prevent the run loop from exiting.
