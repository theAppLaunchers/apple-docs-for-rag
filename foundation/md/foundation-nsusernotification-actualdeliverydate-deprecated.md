var actualDeliveryDate: Date? { get }
```

Deprecated

All NSUserNotifications API should be replaced with UserNotifications.frameworks API

## Discussion

The notification center will set this value if a notification is put in the scheduled list and the delivery time arrives.

If the notification is delivered directly using the deliver(_:) method of the NSUserNotificationCenter class, this value is set to the deliveryDate value. If the deliveryDate value `nil` this value is set to the current date.

This value is used to sort the list of notifications in the user interface.
