Instance Property

# httpBodyStream

The stream used to deliver the HTTP body.

iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 8.0+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
var httpBodyStream: InputStream? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The stream is returned for examination only; itâ€™s unsafe for the caller to manipulate the stream in any way.

Note

The httpBodyStream and httpBody are mutually exclusive - only one can be set on a given request. The body stream is preserved across copies, but is lost when the request is coded via the NSCoding protocol
