## Discussion

If no default time zone has been set, the current system time zone is used. If the current system time zone cannot be determined, the GMT time zone is used instead.

The default time zone is used by the app for date and time operations. You can set it to cause the app to run as if it were in a different time zone. Setting the default property clears any value that was previously set.

If you access the default class property, assign its value to a variable, and set a new default time zone, the object stored in the variable doesnâ€™t update to reflect the new default time zone. Contrast this behavior with that of the local class property, which returns a proxy object that always reflects the current system time zone.
