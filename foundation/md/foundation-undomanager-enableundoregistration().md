## Discussion

Because undo registration is enabled by default, it is often used to balance a prior disableUndoRegistration() message. Undo registration isnâ€™t actually re-enabled until an enable message balances the last disable message in effect. Raises an `NSInternalInconsistencyException` if invoked while no disableUndoRegistration() message is in effect.
