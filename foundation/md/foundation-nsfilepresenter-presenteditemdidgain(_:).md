``` source
optional func presentedItemDidGain(_ version: NSFileVersion)
```

## Parameters 

`version`  

The file version object containing information about the new file version.

## Discussion

Your delegate can use this method to determine how to incorporate data from the new version of the file or file package. If the file has not been modified by your code, you might simply update to the new version quietly. However, if your application has its own changes, you might need to ask the user how to proceed.
