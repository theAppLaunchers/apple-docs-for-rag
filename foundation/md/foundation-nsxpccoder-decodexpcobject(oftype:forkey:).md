Instance Method

# decodeXPCObject(ofType:forKey:)

Decodes an object and validates that its type matches the type a service provides over XPC.

iOS 7.0+iPadOS 7.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.9+

``` source
func decodeXPCObject(
    ofType type: xpc_type_t,
    forKey key: String
) -> xpc_object_t?
```

## Parameters 

`type`  

An opaque pointer to an encoded XPC object.

`key`  

A string that your app uses to reference the decoded object.

## Return Value

An object that XPC can encode.

## Discussion

The decodeXPCObject(ofType:forKey:) method validates that the type of the decoded object matches the type of the encoded object. If they donâ€™t match, the NSXPCCoder throws an exception in support of NSSecureCoding.

Be sure to check the result against null if you call an XPC function because calling an XPC function on a null object results in a crash.
