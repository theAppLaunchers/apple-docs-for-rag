``` source
struct AsyncBytes
```

## Overview

Use the `for`-`await`-`in` syntax to iterate over the bytes in this sequence. For text files, you can also use its `characters`, `unicodeScalars`, or `lines` properties to retrieve the contents in a more convenient format. Since all of these properties conform to AsyncSequence, as does the FileHandle property bytes, you can use methods defined by AsyncSequence to perform powerful inline processing. For example, you can skip the first `n` bytes of the file with `myFileHandle.bytes.prefix(n)`.
