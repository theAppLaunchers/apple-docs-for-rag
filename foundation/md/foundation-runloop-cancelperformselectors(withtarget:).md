``` source
func cancelPerformSelectors(withTarget target: Any)
```

## Parameters 

`target`  

The previously-specified target.

## Discussion

This method cancels the previously scheduled messages associated with the target, ignoring the selector and argument of the scheduled operation. This is in contrast to cancelPerform(_:target:argument:), which requires you to match the selector and argument as well as the target. This method removes the perform requests for the object from all modes of the run loop.
