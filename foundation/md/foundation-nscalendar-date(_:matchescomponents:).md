``` source
func date(
    _ date: Date,
    matchesComponents components: DateComponents
) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`date`  

The date for which to perform the calculation.

`components`  

The date components to match.

## Return Value

true if the given date matches the given components, otherwise false.

## Discussion

This method is useful for determining whether dates calculated by methods like nextDate(after:matching:value:options:) or enumerateDates(startingAfter:matching:options:using:) are exact, or required an adjustment due to a nonexistent time.
