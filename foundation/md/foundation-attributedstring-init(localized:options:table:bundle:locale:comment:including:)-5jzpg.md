Initializer

# init(localized:options:table:bundle:locale:comment:including:)

Creates an attributed string by looking up a localized string from the app’s bundle, including an attribute scope that a key path identifies.

iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+tvOS 15.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 8.0+

``` source
init(
    localized key: String.LocalizationValue,
    options: AttributedString.FormattingOptions = [],
    table: String? = nil,
    bundle: Bundle? = nil,
    locale: Locale? = nil,
    comment: StaticString? = nil,
    including scope: KeyPath
) where S : AttributeScope
```

## Parameters 

`key`  

The key for a string in the table that `table` identifies.

`options`  

Options that affect the handling of attributes.

`table`  

The bundle’s string table to search. If `table` is `nil` or is an empty string, the method attempts to use the table in `Localizable.strings`. The default is `nil`.

`bundle`  

The bundle to use for looking up strings. If `nil`, an app searches its main bundle. The default is `nil`.

`locale`  

The locale of the localized string to retrieve. If `nil`, this initializer uses the current locale. The default is `nil`.

`comment`  

The comment to place above the key-value pair in the strings file. This parameter provides the translator with some context about the localized string’s presentation to the user.

`scope`  

An AttributeScopes key path that identifies an attribute scope to associate with the attributed string.

## Discussion

To create localizable attributed strings, use Markdown syntax in your strings files. The following example shows a string from a Spanish localization:

```
"_Please visit our [website](https://www.example.com)._" = "_Visita nuestro [sitio web](https://www.example.com)._";
```

You load this string with one of the initializers that takes `localized` as its first parameter, like the following:

```
let visitString = AttributedString(localized: "_Please visit our [website](https://www.example.com)._")
```

The resulting attributed string contains an inlinePresentationIntent attribute to apply the emphasized presentation intent over the entire string. It also applies the link attribute to the text `sitio web`. User interface frameworks like SwiftUI and UIKit can then use these attributes when presenting the text to the user.

### Applying Automatic Grammar Agreement

To apply the automatic grammar agreement feature when loading a localized string, use Apple’s Markdown extension syntax: `^[text to inflect](inflect: true)`. The following example shows a format string with a Spanish localization for a food-ordering app.

```
"_Please visit our [website](https://www.example.com)._" = "_Visita nuestro [sitio web](https://www.example.com)._";
```

You load and localize this string as follows:

```
let orderString = AttributedString(
     localized: "Add ^[\(quantity) \(foodSizeSelection.localizedName) \(food.localizedName)](inflect: true) to your order")
// "Añadir 2 ensaladas grandes a tu pedido."
```

When the string loads, the automatic grammar agreement feature adjusts the text for `foodSizeSelection` and `food` to match the number and gender of the sentence.
