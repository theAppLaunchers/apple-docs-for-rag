## Overview

You typically use instances of UnitFrequency to represent specific quantities of frequency using the NSMeasurement class.

### Frequency

Frequency is a quantity of occurrences for a repeating event over time. The SI unit for frequency is the hertz (Hz), which is a derived as one occurrence per second (`1 Hz = 1 / 1s`).

The UnitFrequency class defines its baseUnit() as hertz, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:

| Name | Method | Symbol | Coefficient |
|----|----|----|----|
| Terahertz | terahertz | THz | `1e12` |
| Gigahertz | gigahertz | GHz | `1e9` |
| Megahertz | megahertz | MHz | `1000000.0` |
| Kilohertz | kilohertz | kHz | `1000.0` |
| Hertz | hertz | Hz | `1` |
| Millihertz | millihertz | mHz | `0.001` |
| Microhertz | microhertz | ÂµHz | `0.000001` |
| Nanohertz | nanohertz | nHz | `1e-9` |
