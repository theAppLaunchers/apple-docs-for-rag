Instance Method

# unarchiver(\_:didDecode:)

Informs the delegate that a given object has been decoded.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
optional func unarchiver(
    _ unarchiver: NSKeyedUnarchiver,
    didDecode object: Any?
) -> Any?
```

## Parameters 

`unarchiver`  

An unarchiver for which the receiver is the delegate.

`object`  

The object that has been decoded. `object` may be `nil`.

## Return Value

The object to use in place of `object`. The delegate can either return `object` or return a different object to replace the decoded one. In apps using ARC, the delegate should only return `nil` if `object` itself is `nil`. In apps not using ARC, the delegate can return `nil` to indicate that the decoded value is unchangedâ€”that is, `object` will be decoded.

## Discussion

This method is called after `object` has been sent init(coder:) and awakeAfter(using:).

The delegate may use this method to keep track of the decoded objects.
