``` source
func failWithError(_ error: any Error)
```

## Parameters 

`error`  

An error that indicates why decoding failed.

## Discussion

Typically, you call this method in your init(coder:) implementation. You should set the error when you detect problems such as lack of secure coding, data corruption, or a domain validation failure.

This method is only meaningful to call for decodes.

The effect of calling this method depends on the value of decodingFailurePolicy, as follows:

- If the policy is NSCoder.DecodingFailurePolicy.raiseException, calling this method throws an exception immediately. Swift code cannot catch this kind of exception.

- If the policy is NSCoder.DecodingFailurePolicy.setErrorAndReturn, calling this method sets the error property once per call to one of the `decode` methods. Calling it repeatedly has no effect until the call stack unwinds to one of these methodsâ€™ entry points.
