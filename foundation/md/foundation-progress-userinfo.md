## Discussion

A KVO-compliant dictionary that changes in response to setUserInfoObject(_:forKey:). The dictionary sends all of its KVO notifications on the thread that updates the property.

Some entries have meanings that the `NSProgress` class recognizes. For more information, see Recognizing Kinds of Progress, Using General Keys, Using File Operation Keys, and Recognizing Kinds of File Operations.
