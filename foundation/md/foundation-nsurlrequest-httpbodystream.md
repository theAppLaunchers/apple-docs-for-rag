## Discussion

`nil` if the body stream has not been set. The returned stream is for examination onlyâ€”it is not safe to manipulate the stream in any way.

The receiver will have either an HTTP body or an HTTP body stream, only one may be set for a request. A HTTP body stream is preserved when copying an NSURLRequest object, but is lost when a request is archived using the NSCoding protocol.
