``` source
func paths(
    forResourcesOfType ext: String?,
    inDirectory subpath: String?,
    forLocalization localizationName: String?
) -> [String]
```

## Parameters 

`ext`  

The filename extension of the files to locate.

If you specify an empty string or `nil`, the extension is assumed not to exist and all of the files in `subpath` are returned.

`subpath`  

The name of the bundle subdirectory to search.

`localizationName`  

The language ID for the localization. This parameter should correspond to the name of one of the bundleâ€™s language-specific resource directories without the `.lproj` extension.

## Return Value

An array containing the full pathnames for all bundle resources matching the specified criteria. This method returns an empty array if no matching resource files are found.

## Discussion

This method is equivalent to paths(forResourcesOfType:inDirectory:), except that only nonlocalized resources and those in the language-specific `.lproj` directory specified by `localizationName` are searched.
