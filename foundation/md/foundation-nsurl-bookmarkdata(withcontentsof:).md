## Discussion

This method doesnâ€™t check to see if `bookmarkFileURL` points to an alias file. This allows this method to work with any file containing bookmark data. If `bookmarkFileURL` refers to a file which does not contain bookmark data or to a non-file object, such as a directory or symbolic link, this method returns `nil` produces an error.

This method returns `nil` if bookmark data cannot be created.

Handling Errors in Swift

In Swift, this method returns a nonoptional result and is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure.

You call this method in a `try` expression and handle any errors in the `catch` clauses of a `do` statement, as described in Error Handling in The Swift Programming Language and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.
