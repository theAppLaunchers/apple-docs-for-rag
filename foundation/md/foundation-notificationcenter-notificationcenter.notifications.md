## Overview

Use the notifications(named:object:) method to create an instance of this type, then iterate over its elements with the `for`-`await`-`in` syntax.

Tip

The Notification type doesnâ€™t conform to Sendable, so iterating over this asynchronous sequence produces a compiler warning. You can use a `map(_:)-3wc5j` or `compactMap(_:)-6wlbd` operator on the sequence to extract sendable properties of the notification and iterate over those instead. See notifications(named:object:) for an example of this approach.
