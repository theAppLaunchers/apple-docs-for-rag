Instance Method

# urls(forResourcesWithExtension:subdirectory:)

Returns an array of file URLs for all resources identified by the specified file extension and located in the specified bundle subdirectory.

iOS 4.0+iPadOS 4.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.6+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func urls(
    forResourcesWithExtension ext: String?,
    subdirectory subpath: String?
) -> [URL]?
```

## Parameters 

`ext`  

The filename extension of the files to locate.

If you specify an empty string or `nil`, the extension is assumed not to exist and all of the files in `subpath` are returned.

`subpath`  

The name of the bundle subdirectory.

## Return Value

An array of file URLs for the resource files or `nil` if no files could be located at `subpath` with `extension`. Returns an empty array if no matching resource files are found.

## Discussion

If `subpath` is `nil`, this method searches the top-level non-localized resource directory and the top-level of any language-specific directories. (In macOS, the top-level non-localized resource directory is typically called `Resources` but in iOS, it is the main bundle directory.)

For example, suppose you have a Mac app with a modern bundle and you specify `@"Documentation"` for the `subpath` parameter. This method would first look in the `Contents/Resources/Documentation` directory of the bundle, followed by the `Documentation` subdirectories of each language-specific `.lproj` directory. (The search order for the language-specific directories corresponds to the userâ€™s preferences.) This method does not recurse through any other subdirectories at any of these locations. For more details see The Bundle Search Pattern in Bundle Programming Guide.
