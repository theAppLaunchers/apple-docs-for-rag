Instance Method

# urls(forResourcesWithExtension:subdirectory:)

Returns an array of file URLs for all resources identified by the specified file extension and located in the specified bundle subdirectory.

iOS 4.0+iPadOS 4.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.6+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func urls(
    forResourcesWithExtension ext: String?,
    subdirectory subpath: String?
) -> [URL]?
```

## Parameters 

`ext`  

The filename extension of the files to locate.

If you specify an empty string or `nil`, the extension is assumed not to exist and all of the files in `subpath` are returned.

`subpath`  

The name of the bundle subdirectory.

## Return Value

An array of file URLs for the resource files or `nil` if no files could be located at `subpath` with `extension`. Returns an empty array if no matching resource files are found.

## Discussion

If `subpath` is `nil`, this method searches the top-level non-localized resource directory and the top-level of any language-specific directories. (In macOS, the top-level non-localized resource directory is typically called `Resources` but in iOS, it is the main bundle directory.)

For example, suppose you have a Mac app with a modern bundle and you specify `@"Documentation"` for the `subpath` parameter. This method would first look in the `Contents/Resources/Documentation` directory of the bundle, followed by the `Documentation` subdirectories of each language-specific `.lproj` directory. (The search order for the language-specific directories corresponds to the user’s preferences.) This method does not recurse through any other subdirectories at any of these locations. For more details see The Bundle Search Pattern in Bundle Programming Guide.
