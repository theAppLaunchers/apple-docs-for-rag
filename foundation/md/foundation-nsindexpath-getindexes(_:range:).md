``` source
func getIndexes(
    _ indexes: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    range positionRange: NSRange
)
```

## Parameters 

`indexes`  

Pointer to a C array of at least as many NSUInteger objects as specified by the length of `positionRange`. On return, the array holds the index pathâ€™s indexes.

`positionRange`  

A range of valid positions within the index path. If the location plus the length of `positionRange` is greater than the length of the index path, this method raises an rangeException.

## Discussion

You must allocate the memory for the C array.
