``` source
func appendingPathComponent(_ str: String) -> String
```

## Parameters 

`str`  

The path component to append to the receiver.

## Return Value

A new string made by appending `aString` to the receiver, preceded if necessary by a path separator.

## Discussion

The following table illustrates the effect of this method on a variety of different paths, assuming that `aString` is supplied as “`scratch.tiff`”:

| Receiver’s String Value | Resulting String      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| “`/tmp`”                | “`/tmp/scratch.tiff`” |
| “`/tmp/`”               | “`/tmp/scratch.tiff`” |
| “`/`”                   | “`/scratch.tiff`”     |
| “” (an empty string)    | “`scratch.tiff`”      |

Note that this method only works with file paths (not, for example, string representations of URLs).

### Working with Paths

class func path(withComponents: [String]) -> String

Returns a string built from the strings in a given array by concatenating them with a path separator between each pair.

var pathComponents: [String]

The file-system path components of the receiver.

func completePath(into: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer&lt;NSString?>?, caseSensitive: Bool, matchesInto: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer&lt;NSArray?>?, filterTypes: [String]?) -> Int

Interprets the receiver as a path in the file system and attempts to perform filename completion, returning a numeric value that indicates whether a match was possible, and by reference the longest path that matches the receiver.

var fileSystemRepresentation: UnsafePointer&lt;CChar>

A file system-specific representation of the receiver.

func getFileSystemRepresentation(UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;CChar>, maxLength: Int) -> Bool

Interprets the receiver as a system-independent path and fills a buffer with a C-string in a format and encoding suitable for use with file-system calls.

var isAbsolutePath: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the receiver represents an absolute path.

var lastPathComponent: String

The last path component of the receiver.

var pathExtension: String

The path extension, if any, of the string as interpreted as a path.

var abbreviatingWithTildeInPath: String

A new string that replaces the current home directory portion of the current path with a tilde (`~`) character.

func appendingPathExtension(String) -> String?

Returns a new string made by appending to the receiver an extension separator followed by a given extension.

var deletingLastPathComponent: String

A new string made by deleting the last path component from the receiver, along with any final path separator.

var deletingPathExtension: String

A new string made by deleting the extension (if any, and only the last) from the receiver.

var expandingTildeInPath: String

A new string made by expanding the initial component of the receiver to its full path value.

var resolvingSymlinksInPath: String

A new string made from the receiver by resolving all symbolic links and standardizing path.

var standardizingPath: String

A new string made by removing extraneous path components from the receiver.
