## Discussion

This returns a null-terminated C string in file system representation.

This string is automatically freed in the same way that a returned object would be released. The caller must either copy the string or use getFileSystemRepresentation(_:maxLength:) if it needs to store the representation outside of the autorelease context in which the value was obtained.

The file system representation format is described in File Encodings and Fonts.
