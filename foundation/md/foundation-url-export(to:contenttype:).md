func export(
    to destinationDirectory: URL,
    contentType: UTType?
) async throws -> URL
```

`destinationDirectory`  

A directory to write the file to.

`contentType`  

A content type of the requested file. If `nil`, the first transfer representation is be used.

## Return Value

A URL of the created file. The file is owned by the application, and it is responsible for removing it when the file is not needed anymore.

If the `Transferable` is not backed by a file, this will write the data to specified destination. This function uses the first representation provided for a given type in `static var transferRepresentation` requirement of the `Transferable` protocol or in the `body` of a custom `TransferRepresentation`.

The default implementation of this function is available to all types that conform to `Transferable` protocol.
