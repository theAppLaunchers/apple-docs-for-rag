var resourceSpecifier: String? { get }
```

## Discussion

This property contains the resource specifier. Any percent-encoded characters are not unescaped. For example, in the URL `http://www.example.com/index.html?key1=value1#jumplink`, the resource specifier is `//www.example.com/index.html?key1=value1#jumplink` (everything after the colon).

Important

If the receiver does not specify a net location portion of the URL, as returned by the toll-free bridged `CFURL` function CFURLCopyNetLocation(_:), then this method returns only the path of the receiver. For example, in the URL `file:///file.txt`, the resource specifier is `/file.txt`.
