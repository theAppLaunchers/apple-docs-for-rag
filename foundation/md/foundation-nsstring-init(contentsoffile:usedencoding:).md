convenience init(
    contentsOfFile path: String,
    usedEncoding enc: UnsafeMutablePointer?
) throws
```

## Parameters 

`path`  

A path to a file.

`enc`  

Upon return, if the file is read successfully, contains the encoding used to interpret the file at `path`. For possible values, see NSStringEncoding.

## Return Value

## Discussion

Handling Errors in Swift

In Swift, this method returns a nonoptional result and is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure.

You call this method in a `try` expression and handle any errors in the `catch` clauses of a `do` statement, as described in Error Handling in The Swift Programming Language and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.
