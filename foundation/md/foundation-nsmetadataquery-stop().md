## Discussion

The receiver first completes gathering any unprocessed results. If a query is stopped before the gathering phase finishes, it does not post an `NSMetadataQueryDidStartGatheringNotification` notification.

You call this function to stop a query that is generating too many results to be useful but you still want to access the available results. If the receiver is sent a `startQuery` message after performing this method, the existing results are discarded.
