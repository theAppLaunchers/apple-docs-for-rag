``` source
optional func presentedItemDidResolveConflict(_ version: NSFileVersion)
```

## Parameters 

`version`  

The version object containing the conflicting change.

## Discussion

Your delegate can use this method to respond to the resolution of a version conflict by a different file presenter. This might occur if a version of your application running on another device resolves the conflict first. You might then use this method to update your user interface to indicate that there is no longer a conflict.
