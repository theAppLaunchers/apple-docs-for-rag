## Discussion

The system considers an interface expensive if itâ€™s more costly or consumes more power, such as 3G or LTE as compared to ethernet or Wi-Fi. You permit or deny use of expensive interfaces with the allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess property on URLSessionConfiguration or allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess on URLRequest.
