## Discussion

This property corresponds to the `nu` key of the Unicode BCP 47 extension.

For locale instances created with the `nu` specifier (such as `en-US@nu=jpanfin`), or with a custom Locale.Components, this property represents the custom numbering system. Otherwise, it represents the localeâ€™s default numbering system.
