## Discussion

The network service type provides a hint to the operating system about what the underlying traffic is used for. This hint enhances the systemâ€™s ability to prioritize traffic, determine how quickly it needs to wake up the cellular or Wi-Fi radio, and so on. By providing accurate information, you improve the ability of the system to optimally balance battery life, performance, and other considerations.
