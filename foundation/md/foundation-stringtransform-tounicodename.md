``` source
static let toUnicodeName: StringTransform
```

## Discussion

For example, the string ‚Äúüê∂üêÆ‚Äù transforms to ``` "``\N{DOG FACE}\N{COW FACE}" ``` .

Passing this constant to the applyTransform(_:reverse:range:updatedRange:) method is equivalent to passing kCFStringTransformToUnicodeName to CFStringTransform(_:_:_:_:).

Note

The result of a forward transformation delimits each Unicode name with enclosing curly braces and the leading character sequence `"\N"`. In some programming languages, `"\N{...}"` is used as an escape sequence for Unicode characters in strings and regular expressions; this isn‚Äôt supported in Swift or Objective-C. To perform the reverse transform of a string literal in Swift or Objective-C, escape the leading backslash (`"\\N{...}"`) for each Unicode name.
