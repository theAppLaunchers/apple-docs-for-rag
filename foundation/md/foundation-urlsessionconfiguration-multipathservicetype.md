Improving network reliability using Multipath TCP

## Discussion

Multipath TCP, defined by the IETF in RFC 6824, is an extension to TCP that permits multiple interfaces to transmit a single data stream. This capability allows a seamless handover from Wi-Fi to cellular, aimed at making both interfaces more efficient and improving the user experience.

The multipathServiceType property defines which policy the Multipath TCP stack uses to schedule traffic across Wi-Fi and cellular interfaces. The default value is `none`, meaning Multipath TCP is disabled. You can also select handover mode, which provides seamless handover between Wi-Fi and cellular.

Multipath TCP requires server support. Resources for Linux-based systems are available at https://mptcp.dev.
