``` source
class func fileURL(withPath path: String) -> URL
```

## Parameters 

`path`  

The path that the NSURL object will represent. `path` should be a valid system path, and must not be an empty path. If `path` begins with a tilde, it must first be expanded with expandingTildeInPath. If `path` is a relative path, it is treated as being relative to the current working directory.

## Return Value

An NSURL object initialized with `path`.

## Discussion

This method assumes that `path` is a directory if it ends with a slash. If `path` does not end with a slash, the method examines the file system to determine if `path` is a file or a directory. If `path` exists in the file system and is a directory, the method appends a trailing slash. If `path` does not exist in the file system, the method assumes that it represents a file and does not append a trailing slash.

As an alternative, consider using fileURL(withPath:isDirectory:), which allows you to explicitly specify whether the returned `NSURL` object represents a file or directory.
