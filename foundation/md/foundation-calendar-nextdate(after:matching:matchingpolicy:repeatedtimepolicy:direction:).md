Instance Method

# nextDate(after:matching:matchingPolicy:repeatedTimePolicy:direction:)

Computes the next date which matches (or most closely matches) a given set of components.

``` source
func nextDate(
    after date: Date,
    matching components: DateComponents,
    matchingPolicy: Calendar.MatchingPolicy,
    repeatedTimePolicy: Calendar.RepeatedTimePolicy = .first,
    direction: Calendar.SearchDirection = .forward
) -> Date?
```

## Parameters 

`date`  

The starting date.

`components`  

The components to search for.

`matchingPolicy`  

Specifies the technique the search algorithm uses to find results. Default value is `.nextTime`.

`repeatedTimePolicy`  

Specifies the behavior when multiple matches are found. Default value is `.first`.

`direction`  

Specifies the direction in time to search. Default is `.forward`.

## Return Value

A `Date` representing the result of the search, or `nil` if a result could not be found.

## Discussion

The general semantics follow those of the `enumerateDates` function. To compute a sequence of results, use the `enumerateDates` function, rather than looping and calling this method with the previous loop iterationâ€™s result.

### Scanning Dates

func startOfDay(for: Date) -> Date

Returns the first moment of a given Date, as a Date.

func enumerateDates(startingAfter: Date, matching: DateComponents, matchingPolicy: Calendar.MatchingPolicy, repeatedTimePolicy: Calendar.RepeatedTimePolicy, direction: Calendar.SearchDirection, using: (Date?, Bool, inout Bool) -> Void)

Computes the dates which match (or most closely match) a given set of components, and calls the closure once for each of them, until the enumeration is stopped.

enum MatchingPolicy

A hint to the search algorithm to control the method used for searching for dates.

enum RepeatedTimePolicy

Determines which result to use when a time is repeated on a day in a calendar (for example, during a daylight saving transition when the times between 2:00am and 3:00am may happen twice).
