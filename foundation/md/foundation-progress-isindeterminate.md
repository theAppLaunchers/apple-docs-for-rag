## Discussion

Use isIndeterminate progress only when youâ€™re unable to determine a reasonable value for either completedUnitCount or totalUnitCount. Progress is indeterminate when the value of the totalUnitCount or completedUnitCount is less than zero or if both values are zero. When progress is indeterminate, fractionCompleted returns `0.0` and isFinished returns `false`.

By default, Progress is KVO-compliant for this property. It sends notifications on the same thread that updates the property.

The following code snippet clarifies the behavior for setting both totalUnitCount and completedUnitCount to `0`.

```
let progress = Progress(totalUnitCount: 0) 
progress.completedUnitCount = 0 // default 
print("totalUnitCount: (progress.totalUnitCount)") 
print("completedUnitCount: (progress.completedUnitCount)") 
print("isIndeterminate: (progress.isIndeterminate)") 
print("fractionCompleted: (progress.fractionCompleted)") 
print("isFinished: (progress.isFinished)")
/*
Code Output:
totalUnitCount: 0 completedUnitCount: 0 isIndeterminate: true fractionCompleted: 0.0 isFinished: false
*/
```
