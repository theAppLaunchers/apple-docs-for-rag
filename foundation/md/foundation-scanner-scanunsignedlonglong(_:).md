Instance Method

# scanUnsignedLongLong(\_:)

Scans for an unsigned long long value from a decimal representation, returning a found value by reference.

``` source
func scanUnsignedLongLong(_ result: UnsafeMutablePointer?) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`result`  

Upon return, contains the scanned value. Contains `ULLONG_MAX` on overflow.

## Return Value

true if the receiver finds a valid decimal integer representation, otherwise false. Overflow is considered a valid decimal integer representation.

## Discussion

All overflow digits are skipped. Skips past excess digits in the case of overflow, so the receiverâ€™s position is past the entire decimal representation.

Invoke this method with `NULL` as `unsignedLongLongValue` to simply scan past an unsigned long decimal integer representation.
