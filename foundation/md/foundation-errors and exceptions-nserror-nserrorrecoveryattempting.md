# NSErrorRecoveryAttempting

A set of methods that provide options to recover from an error.

## Overview

The `NSErrorRecoveryAttempting` informal protocol provides methods that allow your application to attempt to recover from an error. These methods are invoked when an `NSError` object is returned that specifies the implementing object as the error `recoveryAttempter` and the user has selected one of the errorâ€™s localized recovery options. The method invoked depends on how the error is presented to the user. If the error is presented in a document-modal sheet, attemptRecovery(fromError:optionIndex:delegate:didRecoverSelector:contextInfo:) is invoked. If the error is presented in an application-modal dialog, attemptRecovery(fromError:optionIndex:) is invoked.
