Use removingPercentEncoding instead.

## Parameters 

`enc`  

The encoding to use for the returned string.

## Return Value

A new string made by replacing in the receiver all percent escapes with the matching characters as determined by the given encoding `encoding`. Returns `nil` if the transformation is not possible, for example, the percent escapes give a byte sequence not legal in `encoding`.
