## Discussion

The mutable data objectâ€™s length parameter is read-writeable. You can set this parameter to expand or truncate the number of bytes contained by the data object. If the mutable data object is expanded, the additional bytes are filled with zeros.

Important

Changing the length of a mutable data object invalidate any existing data pointers returned by the bytes or mutableBytes properties.
