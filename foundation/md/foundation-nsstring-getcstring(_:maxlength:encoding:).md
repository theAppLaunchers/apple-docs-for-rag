Instance Method

# getCString(\_:maxLength:encoding:)

Converts the string to a given encoding and stores it in a buffer.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func getCString(
    _ buffer: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    maxLength maxBufferCount: Int,
    encoding: UInt
) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`buffer`  

Upon return, contains the converted C-string plus the `NULL` termination byte. The buffer must include room for `maxBufferCount` bytes.

`maxBufferCount`  

The maximum number of bytes in the string to return in buffer (*including* the `NULL` termination byte).

`encoding`  

The encoding for the returned C string. For possible values, see NSStringEncoding.

## Return Value

true if the operation was successful, otherwise false. Returns false if conversion is not possible due to encoding errors or if `buffer` is too small.

## Discussion

Note that in the treatment of the `maxBufferCount` argument, this method differs from the deprecated getCString(_:maxLength:) method which it replaces. (The buffer should include room for `maxBufferCount` bytes; this number should accommodate the expected size of the return value plus the `NULL` termination byte, which this method adds.)

You can use canBeConverted(to:) to check whether a string can be losslessly converted to `encoding`. If it canâ€™t, you can use data(using:allowLossyConversion:) to get a C-string representation using `encoding`, allowing some loss of information (note that the data returned by data(using:allowLossyConversion:) is not a strict C-string since it does not have a `NULL` terminator).
