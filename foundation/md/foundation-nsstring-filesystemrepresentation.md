# fileSystemRepresentation

A file system-specific representation of the receiver.

var fileSystemRepresentation: UnsafePointer { get }
```

## Discussion

The returned C string will be automatically freed just as a returned object would be released; your code should copy the representation or use getFileSystemRepresentation(_:maxLength:) if it needs to store the representation outside of the memory context in which the representation was created.

Raises an characterConversionException if the receiver can’t be represented in the file system’s encoding. It also raises an exception if the receiver contains no characters.

Note that this method only works with file paths (not, for example, string representations of URLs).

To convert a `char *` path (such as you might get from a C library routine) to an `NSString` object, use the string(withFileSystemRepresentation:length:) method on FileManager.

### Working with Paths

class func path(withComponents: [String]) -> String

Returns a string built from the strings in a given array by concatenating them with a path separator between each pair.

var pathComponents: [String]

The file-system path components of the receiver.

func completePath(into: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer&lt;NSString?>?, caseSensitive: Bool, matchesInto: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer&lt;NSArray?>?, filterTypes: [String]?) -> Int

Interprets the receiver as a path in the file system and attempts to perform filename completion, returning a numeric value that indicates whether a match was possible, and by reference the longest path that matches the receiver.

func getFileSystemRepresentation(UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;CChar>, maxLength: Int) -> Bool

Interprets the receiver as a system-independent path and fills a buffer with a C-string in a format and encoding suitable for use with file-system calls.

var isAbsolutePath: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the receiver represents an absolute path.

var lastPathComponent: String

The last path component of the receiver.

var pathExtension: String

The path extension, if any, of the string as interpreted as a path.

var abbreviatingWithTildeInPath: String

A new string that replaces the current home directory portion of the current path with a tilde (`~`) character.

func appendingPathComponent(String) -> String

Returns a new string made by appending to the receiver a given string.

func appendingPathExtension(String) -> String?

Returns a new string made by appending to the receiver an extension separator followed by a given extension.

var deletingLastPathComponent: String

A new string made by deleting the last path component from the receiver, along with any final path separator.

var deletingPathExtension: String

A new string made by deleting the extension (if any, and only the last) from the receiver.

var expandingTildeInPath: String

A new string made by expanding the initial component of the receiver to its full path value.

var resolvingSymlinksInPath: String

A new string made from the receiver by resolving all symbolic links and standardizing path.

var standardizingPath: String

A new string made by removing extraneous path components from the receiver.
