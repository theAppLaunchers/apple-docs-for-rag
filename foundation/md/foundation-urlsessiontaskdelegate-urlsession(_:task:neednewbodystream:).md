## Parameters

`completionHandler`

## Mentioned in 

Uploading streams of data

## Discussion

The task calls this delegate method under two circumstances:

- To provide the initial request body stream if the task was created with uploadTask(withStreamedRequest:)

- To provide a replacement request body stream if the task needs to resend a request that has a body stream because of an authentication challenge or other recoverable server error.

Note

You donâ€™t need to implement this method if your code provides the request body using a file URL or a data object.
