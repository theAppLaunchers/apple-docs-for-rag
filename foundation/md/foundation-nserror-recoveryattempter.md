## Discussion

The recovery attempter must be an instance of a class that conforms to the NSSecureCoding and NSErrorRecoveryAttempting protocols. It must also be able to correctly interpret an index in the localizedRecoveryOptions property.

If userInfo doesnâ€™t contain a value for NSRecoveryAttempterErrorKey, this property is `nil`.
