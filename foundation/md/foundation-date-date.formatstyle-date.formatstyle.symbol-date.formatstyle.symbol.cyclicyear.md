## Overview

Calendars such as the Chinese lunar calendar and Hindu calendars use 60-year cycles of year names. If the calendar doesnâ€™t provide cyclic year-name data, or if the year value to format is out of the range of years for which the system provides cyclic name data, then the formatting is numeric, as in Date.FormatStyle.Symbol.Year.

The Date.FormatStyle.Symbol.CyclicYear type includes static factory variables that create custom Date.FormatStyle.Symbol.CyclicYear objects:

| Factory variable | Description |
|----|----|
| abbreviated | A shortened representation of the cyclic year appropriate for space-constrained applications. |
| narrow | The shortest representation of the cyclic year. |
| wide | The full representation of the cyclic year. |

If no format is specified as a parameter, the abbreviated static variable is the default format.

For more information about formatting dates, see Date.FormatStyle.
