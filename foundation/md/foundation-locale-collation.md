## Discussion

This property corresponds to the `co` key of the Unicode BCP 47 extension.

For locale instances created with the `co` specifier (such as `en-US@co=phonetic`), or with a custom Locale.Components, this property represents the custom collation. Otherwise, it represents the localeâ€™s default sort order.
