## Discussion

Once added, the specified operation remains in the queue until it finishes executing.

Important

An operation object can be in at most one operation queue at a time and this method throws an invalidArgumentException exception if the operation is already in another queue. Similarly, this method throws an invalidArgumentException exception if the operation is currently executing or has already finished executing.
