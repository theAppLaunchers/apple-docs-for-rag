## Discussion

`NSNotFound` is typically used by various methods and functions that search for items in serial data and return indices, such as characters in a string object or `id` objects in an `NSArray` object.

### Special Considerations

Prior to OS X v10.5, `NSNotFound` was defined as `0x7fffffff`. For 32-bit systems, this was effectively the same as `NSIntegerMax`. To support 64-bit environments, `NSNotFound` is now formally defined as `NSIntegerMax`. This means, however, that the value is different in 32-bit and 64-bit environments. You should therefore not save the value directly in files or archives. Moreover, sending the value between 32-bit and 64-bit processes via Distributed Objects will not get you `NSNotFound` on the other side. This applies to any Cocoa methods invoked over Distributed Objects and which might return `NSNotFound`, such as the `indexOfObject:` method of `NSArray` (if sent to a proxy for an array).
