## Discussion

This notification is sent only upon a change received from iCloud; it is not sent when your app sets a value.

The user info dictionary can contain the reason for the notification as well as a list of which values changed, as follows:

- The value of the NSUbiquitousKeyValueStoreChangeReasonKey key, when present, indicates why the key-value store changed. Its value is one of the constants in Change Reason Values.

- The value of the NSUbiquitousKeyValueStoreChangedKeysKey, when present, is an array of strings, each the name of a key whose value changed.

The notification object is the NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore object whose contents changed.

Important

Early in your appâ€™s launch sequence, register for the didChangeExternallyNotification notification using the NotificationCenter class. Specify the default key-value store object (obtained using the default class method) as the object whose notifications you want to receive.
