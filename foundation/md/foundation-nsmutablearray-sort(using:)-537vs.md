A selector that specifies the comparison method to use to compare elements in the array.

The `comparator` message is sent to each object in the array and has as its single argument another object in the array. The `comparator` method should return `NSOrderedAscending` if the array is smaller than the argument, `NSOrderedDescending` if the array is larger than the argument, and `NSOrderedSame` if they are equal.
