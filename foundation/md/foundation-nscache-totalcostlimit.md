## Discussion

If `0`, there is no total cost limit. The default value is `0`.

When you add an object to the cache, you may pass in a specified cost for the object, such as the size in bytes of the object. If adding this object to the cache causes the cacheâ€™s total cost to rise above `totalCostLimit`, the cache may automatically evict objects until its total cost falls below `totalCostLimit`. The order in which the cache evicts objects is not guaranteed.

This is not a strict limit, and if the cache goes over the limit, an object in the cache could be evicted instantly, at a later point in time, or possibly never, all depending on the implementation details of the cache.
