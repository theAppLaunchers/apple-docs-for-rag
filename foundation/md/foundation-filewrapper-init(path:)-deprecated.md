Initializer

# init(path:)

Initializes a file wrapper instance whose kind is determined by the type of file-system node located by the path.

macOS 10.0â€“10.10Deprecated

``` source
convenience init?(path: String)
```

Deprecated

Use init(url:options:) instead.

## Parameters 

`path`  

Pathname of the file-system node the file wrapper is to represent.

## Return Value

File wrapper for `node`.

## Discussion

If `node` is a directory, this method recursively creates file wrappers for each node within that directory.

### Special Considerations

Beginning with OS X v10.6, the preferred method of referring to files is with a `file://` URL. Therefore, this method has been deprecated in favor of init(url:options:).
