## Discussion

All individual undo operations back to the matching beginUndoGrouping() message are grouped together and reversed by a later undo() or undoNestedGroup() message. Undo groups can be nested, thus providing functionality similar to nested transactions. Raises an `NSInternalInconsistencyException` if thereâ€™s no beginUndoGrouping() message in effect.

This method posts an NSUndoManagerCheckpoint and an NSUndoManagerDidCloseUndoGroup just before the group is closed.
