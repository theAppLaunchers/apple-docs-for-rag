```

## Discussion

Numeric comparison only applies to the numerals in the string, not other characters that would have meaning in a numeric representation such as a negative sign, a comma, or a decimal point.

This option only applies to compare methods, not find.

### Constants

static var caseInsensitive: NSString.CompareOptions

A case-insensitive search.

static var literal: NSString.CompareOptions

Exact character-by-character equivalence.

static var backwards: NSString.CompareOptions

Search from end of source string.

static var anchored: NSString.CompareOptions

Search is limited to start (or end, if `NSBackwardsSearch`) of source string.

static var diacriticInsensitive: NSString.CompareOptions

Search ignores diacritic marks.

static var widthInsensitive: NSString.CompareOptions

Search ignores width differences in characters that have full-width and half-width forms, as occurs in East Asian character sets.

static var forcedOrdering: NSString.CompareOptions

Comparisons are forced to return either `NSOrderedAscending` or `NSOrderedDescending` if the strings are equivalent but not strictly equal.

static var regularExpression: NSString.CompareOptions

The search string is treated as an ICU-compatible regular expression. If set, no other options can apply except caseInsensitive and anchored. You can use this option only with the `rangeOfString:`â€¦ methods and replacingOccurrences(of:with:options:range:).
