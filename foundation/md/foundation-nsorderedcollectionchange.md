## Overview

An ordered collection change represents changes by adding, removing, or moving objects within an ordered collection. Changes with an associated index indicate a move within the collection.

## Topics

### Creating a Change

convenience init(object: Any?, type: NSCollectionChangeType, index: Int)

Creates a change object that represents inserting or removing an object from an ordered collection at a specific index.

init(object: Any?, type: NSCollectionChangeType, index: Int, associatedIndex: Int)

Creates a change object that represents inserting, removing, or moving an object from an ordered collection at a specific index.

### Accessing the Change

var changeType: NSCollectionChangeType

The type of change.

var index: Int

The index location of the change.

var object: Any?

An object the change inserts or removes.

var associatedIndex: Int

When this property is set to a value other than NSNotFound, the receiver is one half of a move, and this value is the index of the changeâ€™s counterpart of the opposite type in the diff.
