## Discussion

After closing the top-level undo group, this method invokes undoNestedGroup().

This method also invokes endUndoGrouping() if the nesting level is 1. Raises an `NSInternalInconsistencyException` if more than one undo group is open (that is, if the last group isnâ€™t at the top level).

This method posts an NSUndoManagerCheckpoint.
