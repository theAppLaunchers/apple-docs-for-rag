## Discussion

This array contains all the remaining objects of the enumerator in enumerated order. It does not contain objects that have already been enumerated with previous nextObject() messages.

Accessing this property exhausts the enumeratorâ€™s collection so that subsequent invocations of nextObject() return `nil`.
