Initializer

# init(protocolFamily:socketType:protocol:address:)

Initializes the receiver as a local socket with the provided arguments.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
init?(
    protocolFamily family: Int32,
    socketType type: Int32,
    protocol: Int32,
    address: Data
)
```

## Parameters 

`family`  

The protocol family for the socket port. Possible values are defined in ``, such as `AF_LOCAL`, `AF_INET`, and `AF_INET6`.

`type`  

The type of socket.

`protocol`  

The specific protocol to use from the protocol family.

`address`  

The family-specific socket address for the receiver copied into an `NSData` object.

## Return Value

A local socket port initialized with the provided arguments.

## Discussion

The receiver must be added to a run loop before it can accept connections or receive messages. Incoming messages are passed to the receiverâ€™s delegate method handlePortMessage:.

To create a standard TCP/IP socket, use init(tcpPort:).
