## Discussion

On decode failure, the NSCoder will capture the failure as an NSError, and prevent further decodes (by returning `0` / `nil` equivalent as appropriate).

Use this policy if you know that all encoded objects use failWithError(_:) to communicate decode failures and donâ€™t raise exceptions for error propagation.
