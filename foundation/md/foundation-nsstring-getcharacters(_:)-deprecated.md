Instance Method

# getCharacters(\_:)

Copies all characters from the receiver into a given buffer.

``` source
func getCharacters(_ buffer: UnsafeMutablePointer)
```

Deprecated

This method is unsafe because it could potentially cause buffer overruns. Use getCharacters(_:range:) instead.

## Parameters 

`buffer`  

Upon return, contains the characters from the receiver. `buffer` must be large enough to contain all characters in the string (`[string length]*sizeof(unichar)`).

## Discussion

Invokes getCharacters(_:range:) with `buffer` and the entire extent of the receiver as the range.
