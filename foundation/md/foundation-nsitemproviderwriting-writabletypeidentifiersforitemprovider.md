## Discussion

Provide uniform type identifiers (UTIs) in order from highest fidelity to lowest. If your app employs a native data representation, place that first in the array.

Implement this version of the property to offer a minimal list of UTIs that *all* resulting item provider instances can support. For example, using this version of the property for an NSURL object, your implementation should return the `public.url` UTI but not `public.file-url`.

Use the class version of this property when you do not initialize an item provider with an object, thereby deferring the underlying objectâ€™s instantiation until the destination app needs it.
