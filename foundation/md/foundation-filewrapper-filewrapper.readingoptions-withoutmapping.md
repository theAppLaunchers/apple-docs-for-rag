## Discussion

You can use this option to keep `NSFileWrapper` from memory-mapping files. This is useful if you want to make sure your application doesnâ€™t hold files open (mapped files are open files), therefore preventing the user from ejecting DVDs, unmounting disk partitions, or unmounting disk images. In macOS 10.6 and later, `NSFileWrapper` memory-maps files that are on internal drives only. It never memory-maps files on external drives or network volumes, regardless of whether this option is used.
