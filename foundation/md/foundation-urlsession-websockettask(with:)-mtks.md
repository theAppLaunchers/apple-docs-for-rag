``` source
func webSocketTask(with request: URLRequest) -> URLSessionWebSocketTask
```

## Parameters 

`request`  

A URL request that indicates a WebSockets endpoint with which to connect.

## Discussion

You can modify the requestâ€™s properties prior to calling resume() on the task. The task uses these properties during the HTTP handshake phase.

To add custom protocols, add a header with the key `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`, and a comma-separated list of protocols you want to negotiate with the server. The custom HTTP headers provided by the client remain unchanged for the handshake with the server.
