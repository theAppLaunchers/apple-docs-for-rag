## Discussion

This is often the object that posted this notification. In Objective-C, it may be `nil`.

Typically you use this method to find out what object a notification applies to when you receive a notification.

For example, suppose youâ€™ve registered an object to receive the message `handlePortDeath:` when the `PortInvalid` notification is posted to the notification center and that `handlePortDeath:` needs to access the object monitoring the port that is now invalid. `handlePortDeath:` can retrieve that object as shown here:

Example of accessing notification object in Objective-C:

```
- (void)handlePortDeath:(NSNotification *)notification
{
    ...
    [self reclaimResourcesForPort:notification.object];
    ...
}
```
