Instance Method

# connection(\_:willCacheResponse:)

Sent before the connection stores a cached response in the cache, to give the delegate an opportunity to alter it.

``` source
optional func connection(
    _ connection: NSURLConnection,
    willCacheResponse cachedResponse: CachedURLResponse
) -> CachedURLResponse?
```

## Parameters 

`connection`  

The connection sending the message.

`cachedResponse`  

The proposed cached response to store in the cache.

## Return Value

The actual cached response to store in the cache. The delegate may return `cachedResponse` unmodified, return a modified cached response, or return `nil` if no cached response should be stored for the connection.

## Discussion

This method is called only if the URLProtocol handling the request decides to cache the response. As a rule, responses are cached only when all of the following are true:

- The request is for an HTTP or HTTPS URL (or your own custom networking protocol that supports caching).

- The request was successful (with a status code in the `200–299` range).

- The provided response came from the server, rather than out of the cache.

- The NSURLRequest object’s cache policy allows caching.

- The cache-related headers in the server’s response (if present) allow caching.

- The response size is small enough to reasonably fit within the cache. (For example, if you provide a disk cache, the response must be no larger than about 5% of the disk cache size.)
