## Discussion

A multiplier is a factor used in conversions between numbers and strings (that is, numbers as stored and numbers as displayed). When the input value is a string, the multiplier is used to divide, and when the input value is a number, the multiplier is used to multiply. These operations allow the formatted values to be different from the values that a program manipulates internally.
