# NSUserScriptTask

An object that executes scripts.

macOS 10.8+

``` source
class NSUserScriptTask
```

## Overview

The NSUserScriptTask class is able to run all the scripts normally run by the one of its subclasses, however it ignores the results. It is intended to execute user-supplied scripts and will execute them outside of the applicationâ€™s sandbox, if any.

If you need to execute scripts and get the input and output information use the NSUserUnixTask, NSUserAppleScriptTask, and NSUserAutomatorTask sub classes.

## Topics

### Specifying the Script

init(url: URL) throws

var scriptURL: URL

The URL of the script file.

### Executing the User Script

func execute(completionHandler: NSUserScriptTask.CompletionHandler?)

Executes the script with no input and ignoring any result.

### Constants

typealias CompletionHandler

Implement this block to retrieve the error of the script executed by execute(completionHandler:).
