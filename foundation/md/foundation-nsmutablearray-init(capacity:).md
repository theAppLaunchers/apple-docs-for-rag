``` source
init(capacity numItems: Int)
```

## Parameters 

`numItems`  

The initial capacity of the new array.

## Return Value

An array initialized with enough memory to hold `numItems` objects. The returned object might be different than the original receiver.

## Discussion

Mutable arrays expand as needed; `numItems` simply establishes the objectâ€™s initial capacity.

This method is a designated initializer.
