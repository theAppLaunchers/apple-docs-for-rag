## Discussion

Weekday units are the numbers 1 through *n*, where *n* is the number of days in the week. For example, in the Gregorian calendar, *n* is 7 and Sunday is represented by 1.

This value is interpreted in the context of the calendar with which it is usedâ€”see Calendars, Date Components, and Calendar Units in Date and Time Programming Guide.
