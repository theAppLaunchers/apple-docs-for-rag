iOS 4.0+iPadOS 4.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.6+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func addOperations(
    _ ops: [Operation],
    waitUntilFinished wait: Bool
)
```

## Parameters 

`ops`  

The operations to be added to the queue.

`wait`  

If true, the current thread is blocked until all of the specified operations finish executing. If false, the operations are added to the queue and control returns immediately to the caller.

## Discussion

An operation object can be in at most one operation queue at a time and cannot be added if it is currently executing or finished. This method throws an `NSInvalidArgumentException` exception if any of those error conditions are true for any of the operations in the `ops` parameter.

Once added, the specified `operation` remains in the queue until its isFinished method returns true.
