``` source
func range(
    of searchString: String,
    options mask: NSString.CompareOptions = [],
    range rangeOfReceiverToSearch: NSRange
) -> NSRange
```

## Parameters 

`searchString`  

The string for which to search.

`mask`  

A mask specifying search options. The following options may be specified by combining them with the C bitwise `OR` operator: `NSCaseInsensitiveSearch`, `NSLiteralSearch`, `NSBackwardsSearch`, and `NSAnchoredSearch`. See String Programming Guide for details on these options.

`rangeOfReceiverToSearch`  

The range within the receiver for which to search for `aString`.

Raises an `NSRangeException` if

`rangeOfReceiverToSearch`

is invalid.

## Return Value

An `NSRange` structure giving the location and length in the receiver of

## Discussion

`searchString`

within

`rangeOfReceiverToSearch`

in the receiver, modulo the options in `mask`. The range returned is relative to the start of the string, not to the passed-in range. Returns ``` {``NSNotFound``, 0} ``` if

`searchString`

is not found or is empty (`""`).

## Discussion

`NSString` objects are compared by checking the Unicode canonical equivalence of their code point sequences. T

he length of the returned range and that of

`searchString`

may differ if equivalent composed character sequences are matched.

Important

When working with text thatâ€™s presented to the user, use the localizedStandardRange(of:) method instead.
