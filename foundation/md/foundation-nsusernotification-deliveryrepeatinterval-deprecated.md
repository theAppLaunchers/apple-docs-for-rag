Instance Property

# deliveryRepeatInterval

Specifies the date components that control how often a user notification is repeated.

```

Deprecated

## Discussion

This value may be `nil` if the notification should not repeat.

The date component values are relative to the date the notification was delivered.

If the calendar value of the `deliveryRepeatInterval` is `nil`, the current calendar is used to calculate the repeat interval. For example, if a notification should repeat every hour, set the `hour` property of the `deliveryRepeatInterval` to `1`.

This value is ignored unless the user notification is scheduled with the NSUserNotificationCenter object.
