Instance Property

# terminationHandler

A completion block the system invokes when the task completes.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
var terminationHandler: ((Process) -> Void)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The system passes the task object to the block to allow access to the task parameters, for example to determine if the task completed successfully.

This block isnâ€™t guaranteed to be fully executed prior to waitUntilExit() returning.
