Instance Method

# objectsByEvaluating(withContainers:)

Returns the actual object or objects specified by the receiver as evaluated in the context of given container object.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
func objectsByEvaluating(withContainers containers: Any) -> Any?
```

## Return Value

The actual object or objects specified by the receiver as evaluated in the context of its container object or objects (`containers`).

## Discussion

Invokes indicesOfObjectsByEvaluating(withContainer:count:) on `self` to get an array of pointers to indices of elements in `containers` that have values paired with the message receiverâ€™s key. This method then uses key-value coding to obtain the object or objects associated with the key; it returns these objects or `nil` if there are no matching values in containers. If there are multiple matching values, they are returned in an `NSArray`; if matching values are `nil`, `NSNull` objects are substituted. If `containers` is an `NSArray`, the method recursively evaluates each element in the array and returns an `NSArray` with evaluated objects (including `NSNulls`) in their corresponding slots.

### Evaluating an object specifier

func indicesOfObjectsByEvaluating(withContainer: Any, count: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;Int>) -> UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;Int>?

This primitive method must be overridden by subclasses to return a pointer to an array of indices identifying objects in the key of a given container that are identified by the receiver of the message.

var objectsByEvaluatingSpecifier: Any?

Returns the actual object represented by the nested series of object specifiers.
