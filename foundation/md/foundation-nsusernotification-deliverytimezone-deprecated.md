## Discussion

If this value is `nil` and the user switches time zones, the notification center will adjust the time of presentation to account for the time zone change.

If a notification should be delivered at a time in a specific time zone (regardless of whether the user switches time zones), set this value to the specific time zone, for example the current time zone.
