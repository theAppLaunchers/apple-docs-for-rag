``` source
func replaceObjects(
    in range: NSRange,
    with objects: UnsafePointer?,
    count: Int
)
```

## Parameters 

`range`  

The range of the objects to replace.

`objects`  

A C array of objects.

`count`  

The number of values from the objects C array to insert in place of the objects in `range`. This number will be the count of the new arrayâ€”it must not be negative or greater than the number of elements in objects.

## Discussion

Elements are added to the new array in the same order they appear in objects, up to but not including index count.
