## Discussion

When a student taps on an assignment associated with an app that adopts ClassKit, the framework redirects the student to the corresponding app using either a universal link or a user activity, depending on the appâ€™s configuration. Use the isClassKitDeepLink property of a NSUserActivity instance that you receive to test if that activity is from ClassKit. See Linking directly to assignments for more information.
