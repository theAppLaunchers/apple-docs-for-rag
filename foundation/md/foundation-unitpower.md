## Overview

You typically use instances of UnitPower to represent specific quantities of power using the NSMeasurement class.

### Power

Power is the amount of energy used over time. The SI unit for power is the watt (W), which is derived as one joule per second (1W = 1J / 1s).

The UnitPower class defines its baseUnit() as watts, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:

| Name | Method | Symbol | Coefficient |
|----|----|----|----|
| Terawatts | terawatts | TW | `1e12` |
| Gigawatts | gigawatts | GW | `1e9` |
| Megawatts | megawatts | MW | `1000000.0` |
| Kilowatts | kilowatts | kW | `1000.0` |
| Watts | watts | W | `1` |
| Milliwatts | milliwatts | mW | `0.001` |
| Microwatts | microwatts | ÂµW | `0.000001` |
| Nanowatts | nanowatts | nW | `1e-9` |
| Picowatts | picowatts | pW | `1e-12` |
| Femtowatts | femtowatts | fW | `1e-15` |
| Horsepower | horsepower | hp | `745.7` |
