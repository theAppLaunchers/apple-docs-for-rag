Instance Method

# boundingRect(with:options:attributes:)

Calculates and returns the bounding rect for the receiver drawn using the given options and display characteristics, within the specified rectangle in the current graphics context.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
func boundingRect(
    with size: NSSize,
    options: NSString.DrawingOptions = [],
    attributes: [NSAttributedString.Key : Any]? = nil
) -> NSRect
```

## Parameters 

`size`  

The size of the rectangle to draw in.

`options`  

String drawing options.

`attributes`  

A dictionary of text attributes to be applied to the string. These are the same attributes that can be applied to an `NSAttributedString` object, but in the case of `NSString` objects, the attributes apply to the entire string, rather than ranges within the string.

## Return Value

The bounding rect for the receiver drawn using the given options and display characteristics. The rect origin returned from this method is the first glyph origin.

## Discussion

This method works in single-line, baseline rendering configuration by default. If the string drawing option `NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin` is specified, the method behaves in multiline configuration.
