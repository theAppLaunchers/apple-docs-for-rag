## Discussion

This method asynchronously spawns the new thread and invokes the receiverâ€™s main() method on the new thread. The isExecuting property returns true once the thread starts executing, which may occur after the start() method returns.

If you initialized the receiver with a target and selector, the default main() method invokes that selector automatically.

If this thread is the first thread detached in the application, this method posts the NSWillBecomeMultiThreaded with object `nil` to the default notification center.
