``` source
init(
    request: URLRequest,
    cachedResponse: CachedURLResponse?,
    client: (any URLProtocolClient)?
)
```

## Parameters 

`request`  

The URL request for the URL protocol object. This request is retained.

`cachedResponse`  

A cached response for the request; it may be `nil` if there is no existing cached response for the request.

`client`  

An object that provides an implementation of the URLProtocolClient protocol that this instance uses to communicate with the URL Loading System. This client object is retained.

## Return Value

The initialized protocol object.

## Discussion

Subclasses should override this method to do any custom initialization. Donâ€™t call this method explicitly. When you register your custom protocol class, the system will initialize instances of your protocol as needed.

This is the designated initializer for URLProtocol.
