Instance Method

# encodeArray(ofObjCType:count:at:)

Encodes an array of the given Objective-C type, provided the number of items and a pointer.

``` source
func encodeArray(
    ofObjCType type: UnsafePointer,
    count: Int,
    at array: UnsafeRawPointer
)
```

## Discussion

The values are encoded from the buffer beginning at `address`. `itemType` must contain exactly one type code. `NSCoder`â€™s implementation invokes encodeValue(ofObjCType:at:) to encode the entire array of items. Subclasses that implement the encodeValue(ofObjCType:at:) method do not need to override this method.

This method must be matched by a subsequent decodeArray(ofObjCType:count:at:) message.

For information on creating an Objective-C type code suitable for `itemType`, see Type Encodings.

### Special Considerations

You should not use this method to encode C arrays of Objective-C objects. See decodeArray(ofObjCType:count:at:) for more details.
