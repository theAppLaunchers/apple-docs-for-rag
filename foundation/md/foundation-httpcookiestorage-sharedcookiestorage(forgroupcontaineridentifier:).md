## Discussion

By default, apps and associated app extensions will have different data containers. As a result, the value of the HTTPCookieStorage classâ€™s shared property will refer to different persistent cookie stores when called by the app and by its extensions.You can use this method to create a persistent cookie storage available to all apps and extensions with access to the same app group.

Subsequent calls to the this method with the same identifier will return the same storage instance.
