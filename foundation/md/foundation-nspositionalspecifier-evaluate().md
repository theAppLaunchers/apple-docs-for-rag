Instance Method

# evaluate()

Causes the receiver to evaluate its position.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
func evaluate()
```

## Discussion

Calling insertionContainer, insertionKey, insertionIndex, or insertionReplaces also causes the receiver to be evaluated, if it hasnâ€™t already been evaluated.
