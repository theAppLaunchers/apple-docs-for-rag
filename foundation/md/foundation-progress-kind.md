## Discussion

This property identifies the kind of progress for the progress object, such as file. It can be `nil`.

If you set a non-`nil` value to kind, the default localizedDescription getter uses the kind of progress. The localizedDescription getter determines how to use the values of other properties, along with values in the user info dictionary, to create a string representation.
