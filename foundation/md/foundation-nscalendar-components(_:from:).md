Instance Method

# components(\_:from:)

Returns the date components representing a given date.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func components(
    _ unitFlags: NSCalendar.Unit,
    from date: Date
) -> DateComponents
```

## Parameters 

`unitFlags`  

The components into which to decompose `date`.

`date`  

The date for which to perform the calculation.

## Return Value

An `NSDateComponents` object containing `date` decomposed into the components specified by `unitFlags`. Returns `nil` if `date` falls outside of the defined range of the receiver or if the computation cannot be performed.

## Discussion

The Weekday ordinality, when requested, refers to the next larger (than Week) of the requested units. Some computations can take a relatively long time.

The following example shows how to use this method to determine the current year, month, and day, using an existing calendar (`gregorian`):

```
unsigned unitFlags = NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit |  NSDayCalendarUnit;
NSDate *date = [NSDate date];
NSDateComponents *comps = [gregorian components:unitFlags fromDate:date];
```
