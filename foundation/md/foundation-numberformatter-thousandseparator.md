# thousandSeparator

The character the receiver uses as a thousand separator.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
var thousandSeparator: String! { get set }
```

## Discussion

If you donâ€™t have thousand separators enabled through any other means (such as format), using this method enables them.

### Special Considerations

This method is for use with formatters using `NSNumberFormatterBehavior10_0` behavior.
