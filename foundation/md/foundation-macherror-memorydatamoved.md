Type Property

# memoryDataMoved

A page was requested of a memory manager via memory_object_data_request for an object using a MEMORY_OBJECT_COPY_CALL strategy, with the VM_PROT_WANTS_COPY flag being used to specify that the page desired is for a copy of the object, and the memory manager has detected the page was pushed into a copy of the object while the kernel was walking the shadow chain from the copy to the object. This error code is delivered via memory_object_data_error and is handled by the kernel (it forces the kernel to restart the fault). It will not be seen by users.
