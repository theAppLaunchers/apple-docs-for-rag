## Discussion

Weekday ordinal units represent the position of the weekday within the next larger calendar unit, such as the month. For example, *2* is the weekday ordinal unit for the *second* Friday of the month.

This value is interpreted in the context of the calendar with which it is usedâ€”see Calendars, Date Components, and Calendar Units in Date and Time Programming Guide.
