## Discussion

If you receive an NSUserActivity instance that has its isClassKitDeepLink property set to true, then the activityâ€™s contextIdentifierPath contains the identifier path of the context associated with the assignment that the user tapped to generate the user activity. See Linking directly to assignments for more information.
