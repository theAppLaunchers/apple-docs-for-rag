## Discussion

See DistributedNotificationCenter.SuspensionBehavior for details on how the receiver delivers notifications to their observers when normal notification delivery is suspended.

The NSApplication class automatically suspends distributed notification delivery when the application is not active. Applications based on the Application Kit framework should let AppKit manage the suspension of notification delivery. Foundation-only programs may have occasional need to use this method.
