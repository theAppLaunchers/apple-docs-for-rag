Instance Method

# remove(\_:in:)

Removes all occurrences within a specified range in the array of a given object.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func remove(
    _ anObject: Any,
    in range: NSRange
)
```

## Parameters 

`anObject`  

The object to be removed from the arrayâ€™s content.

`range`  

The range from which to remove `anObject`.

Important

Raises an exception `NSRangeException` if `aRange` exceeds the bounds of the array.

## Discussion

Matches are determined by comparing `anObject` to the objects in the receiver using the `isEqual:` method. If the array does not contain `anObject` within `aRange`, the method has no effect (although it does incur the overhead of searching the contents).
