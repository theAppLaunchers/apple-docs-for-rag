``` source
func scanDouble(_ result: UnsafeMutablePointer?) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`result`  

Upon return, contains the scanned value. Contains `HUGE_VAL` or `–HUGE_VAL` on overflow, or `0.0` on underflow.

## Return Value

true if the receiver finds a valid floating-point representation, otherwise false. Overflow or underflow are both considered valid floating-point representations.

## Discussion

Skips past excess digits in the case of overflow, so the scanner’s position is past the entire floating-point representation.

Invoke this method with `NULL` as `doubleValue` to simply scan past a double value representation. Floating-point representations are assumed to be IEEE compliant.
