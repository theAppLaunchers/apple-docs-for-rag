``` source
func scheduleSendBarrierBlock(_ block: @escaping () -> Void)
```

## Parameters 

`block`  

A block or closure to execute. This block takes no parameters and returns no value.

## Discussion

This barrier block runs after any outstanding send commands complete. However, the remote process isnâ€™t guaranteed to receive the sent messages by the time the block executes. If you need to ensure the remote process received a message, wait for a reply from the process.
