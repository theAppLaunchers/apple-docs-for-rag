## Discussion

The value of this property is true if the cookie should only be sent using HTTP headers, false otherwise.

Cookies can be marked as HTTP-only by a server (or by JavaScript code). Cookies marked as such must only be sent via HTTP Headers in HTTP requests for URLs that match both the path and domain of the respective cookies.

Note

RFC 6265 formally defines the `HttpOnly` attribute.

Important

To prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, donâ€™t deliver cookies marked as HTTP-only to JavaScript code.
