``` source
func enumerateObjects(
    options opts: NSEnumerationOptions = [],
    using block: (Any, Int, UnsafeMutablePointer) -> Void
)
```

## Parameters 

`opts`  

The options for the enumeration. For possible values, see NSEnumerationOptions.

`block`  

A closure or block to execute for each object in the array, taking three arguments:

- The object.

- The index of the object in the array.

- A reference to a Boolean value, which the closure can set to true in order to stop further enumeration of the array. If a closure stops further enumeration, that closure continues to run until itâ€™s finished. When the concurrent enumeration option is specified, enumeration stops after all of the currently running closures finish.

## Discussion

This method executes synchronously. By default, the enumeration starts with the first object and continues serially through the array to the last object. You can specify concurrent and/or reverse as enumeration options to modify this behavior.
