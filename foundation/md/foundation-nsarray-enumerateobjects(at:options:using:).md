Instance Method

# enumerateObjects(at:options:using:)

Executes a given block using the objects in the array at the specified indexes.

iOS 4.0+iPadOS 4.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.6+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func enumerateObjects(
    at s: IndexSet,
    options opts: NSEnumerationOptions = [],
    using block: (Any, Int, UnsafeMutablePointer) -> Void
)
```

## Parameters 

`s`  

The indexes of the objects over which to enumerate.

`opts`  

A bit mask that specifies the options for the enumeration (whether it should be performed concurrently and whether it should be performed in reverse order).

`block`  

The block to apply to elements in the array.

The block takes three arguments:

obj  
The element in the array.

idx  
The index of the element in the array.

stop  
A reference to a Boolean value. The block can set the value to true to stop further enumeration of the array. If a block stops further enumeration, that block continues to run until itâ€™s finished. When the `NSEnumerationConcurrent` enumeration option is specified, enumeration stops after all of the currently running blocks finish. The `stop` argument is an out-only argument. You should only ever set this Boolean to true within the block.

## Discussion

By default, the enumeration starts with the first object and continues serially through the array to the last element specified by `indexSet`. You can specify `NSEnumerationConcurrent` and/or `NSEnumerationReverse` as enumeration options to modify this behavior.

This method executes synchronously.

Important

If the block parameter or the `indexSet` is `nil` this method will raise an exception.
