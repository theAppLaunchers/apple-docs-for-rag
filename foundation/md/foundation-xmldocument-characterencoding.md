Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
var characterEncoding: String? { get set }
```

## Parameters 

`encoding`  

A string that specifies an encoding; it must match the name of an IANA character set. See http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets for a list of valid encoding specifiers.

## Discussion

Typically the encoding is specified in the XML declaration of a document that is processed, but it can be set at any time. If the specified encoding does not match the actual encoding, parsing of the document might fail.
