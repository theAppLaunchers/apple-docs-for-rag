## Overview

You typically use instances of UnitAcceleration to represent specific quantities of acceleration using the NSMeasurement class.

### Acceleration

Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Acceleration can be expressed by SI derived units in terms of meters per second squared (m/s2).

The UnitAcceleration class defines its baseUnit() as metersPerSecondSquared, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:

| Name | Method | Symbol | Coefficient |
|----|----|----|----|
| Meters Per Second Squared | metersPerSecondSquared | m/sÂ² | `1.0` |
| Gravity | gravity | g | `9.81` |

## Topics
