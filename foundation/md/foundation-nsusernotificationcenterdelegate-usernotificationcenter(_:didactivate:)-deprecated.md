## Discussion

This would be a good time to take action in response to user interacting with a specific notification.

To take an action when your application is launched as a result of a user clicking on a notification, be sure to implement the applicationDidFinishLaunching(_:) method in the application class that implements the NSApplicationDelegate protocol. The notification parameter to that method has a `userInfo` dictionary, and if that dictionary has the `NSApplicationLaunchUserNotificationKey` key. The value of that key is the NSUserNotification object that caused the application to launch. The `NSUserNotification` object is delivered to the `NSApplication` delegate because that message will be sent before your application has a chance to set a delegate for the `NSUserNotificationCenter`.
