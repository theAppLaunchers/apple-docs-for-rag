Instance Method

# send(before:)

Attempts to send the message before `aDate`, returning true if successful or false if the operation times out.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
func send(before date: Date) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`date`  

The instant before which the message should be sent.

## Return Value

true if the operation is successful, otherwise false (for example, if the operation times out).

## Discussion

If an error other than a time out occurs, this method could raise an `NSInvalidSendPortException`, `NSInvalidReceivePortException`, or an `NSPortSendException`, depending on the type of send port and the type of error.

If the message cannot be sent immediately, the sending thread blocks until either the message is sent or `aDate` is reached. Sent messages are queued to minimize blocking, but failure can occur if multiple messages are sent to a port faster than the portâ€™s owner can receive them, causing the queue to fill up. Therefore, select a value for `aDate` that provides enough time for the message to be processed before the next message is sent. See the Port class specification for information on receiving a port message.
