## Discussion

When the system detects a conflict involving versions of a file, it sets this property to false to indicate an unresolved conflict. After you resolve the conflict, set this property to true to tell the system it is resolved; you must then remove any versions of the file that are no longer useful.

Important

If you do not explicitly remove versions of a file that are no longer useful, iCloud continues to sync them to all a userâ€™s devices and those versions continue to consume user iCloud quota.

To remove an unused version of a file, call the remove() method. To remove all unused versions of a file, call the removeOtherVersionsOfItem(at:) method.

Important

Never set the value of this property to false. If you do, the system raises an exception.

Resolving a conflict causes the file version object to be removed from any reports about conflicting versions, such as those returned by the unresolvedConflictVersionsOfItem(at:) method.
