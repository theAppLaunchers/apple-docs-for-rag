## Discussion

Set this property to `true` to tell the task that the app would benefit from receiving a partial response body in increments. If the app canâ€™t process the response until it has all the data, set this property to `false`. Task performance may improve when this value is `false`, in which case the task only delivers data when complete.

This property defaults to `true`, except in the following cases which default to `false`:

- The task delivers results to a completion handler rather than to a delegate.

- The task is a download task.
