## Discussion

Logs an error message to the Apple System Log facility (see `man 3 asl`). If the `STDERR_FILENO` file descriptor has been redirected away from the default or is going to a tty, it will also be written there. If you want to direct output elsewhere, you need to use a custom logging facility.

The message consists of a timestamp and the process ID prefixed to the string you pass in. You compose this string with a format string, `format`, and one or more arguments to be inserted into the string. The format specification allowed by these functions is that which is understood by `NSString`â€™s formatting capabilities (which is not necessarily the set of format escapes and flags understood by `printf`). The supported format specifiers are described in String Format Specifiers. A final hard return is added to the error message if one is not present in the format.

In general, you should use the NSLog function instead of calling this function directly. If you do use this function directly, you must have prepared the variable argument list in the `args` argument by calling the standard C macro `va_start`. Upon completion, you must similarly call the standard C macro `va_end` for this list.

Output from `NSLogv` is serialized, in that only one thread in a process can be doing the writing/logging described above at a time. All attempts at writing/logging a message complete before the next thread can begin its attempts.

The effects of `NSLogv` are not serialized with subsystems other than those discussed above (such as the standard I/O package) and do not produce side effects on those subsystems (such as causing buffered output to be flushed, which may be undesirable).
