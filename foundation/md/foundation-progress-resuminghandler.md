``` source
var resumingHandler: (() -> Void)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

If the receiver is a suboperation of another progress object, the system invokes the resumingHandler block when pausing the containing progress object.

### Special Considerations

Youâ€™re responsible for resuming any work for the progress object.

You can invoke the resuming handler on any queue. If you must do work on a specific queue, dispatch to that queue from within the resuming handler block.
