Instance Method

# connection(\_:willSend:redirectResponse:)

Sent when the connection determines that it must change URLs in order to continue loading a request.

``` source
optional func connection(
    _ connection: NSURLConnection,
    willSend request: URLRequest,
    redirectResponse response: URLResponse?
) -> URLRequest?
```

## Parameters 

`connection`  

The connection sending the message.

`request`  

The proposed redirected request. The delegate should inspect the redirected request to verify that it meets its needs, and create a copy with new attributes to return to the connection if necessary.

`response`  

The URL response that caused the redirect. May be `nil` in cases where this method is called because of URL canonicalization.

## Return Value

The actual URL request to use in light of the redirection response. The delegate may return `request` unmodified to allow the redirect, return a new request, or return `nil` to reject the redirect and continue processing the connection.

## Discussion

If `redirectResponse` is `nil`, the URL was canonicalized (rewritten into its standard form) by the URLProtocol object handling the request. Update your user interface to show the standardized form of the URL, then return the original request unmodified.

Otherwise, to cancel the redirect, call the `connection` objectâ€™s `cancel` method, then return the provided request object.

To receive the body of the redirect response itself, return `nil` to cancel the redirect. The connection continues to process, eventually sending your delegate a `connectionDidFinishLoading` or `connection:didFailLoadingWithError:` message, as appropriate.

To redirect the request to a different URL, create a new request object and return it.

Important

Your delegate method is called on the thread where the connection is scheduled. If you call the `cancel` method, do so on that same thread.

The delegate should be prepared to receive this message multiple times.

func connection(NSURLConnection, needNewBodyStream: URLRequest) -> InputStream?

Called when an `NSURLConnection` needs to retransmit a request that has a body stream to provide a new, unopened stream.
