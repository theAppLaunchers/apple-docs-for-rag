## Overview

In addition to the methods in this protocol, be sure to implement the methods in the URLSessionTaskDelegate and URLSessionDelegate protocols to handle events common to all task types and session-level events, respectively.

Note

An URLSession object need not have a delegate. If no delegate is assigned, a system-provided delegate is used, and you must provide a completion callback to obtain the data.

## Topics

### Handling download life cycle changes

func urlSession(URLSession, downloadTask: URLSessionDownloadTask, didFinishDownloadingTo: URL)

Tells the delegate that a download task has finished downloading.

**Required**

### Resuming paused downloads

func urlSession(URLSession, downloadTask: URLSessionDownloadTask, didResumeAtOffset: Int64, expectedTotalBytes: Int64)

Tells the delegate that the download task has resumed downloading.

### Receiving progress updates

func urlSession(URLSession, downloadTask: URLSessionDownloadTask, didWriteData: Int64, totalBytesWritten: Int64, totalBytesExpectedToWrite: Int64)

Periodically informs the delegate about the downloadâ€™s progress.
