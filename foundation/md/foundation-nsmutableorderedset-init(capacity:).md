# init(capacity:)

Returns an initialized mutable ordered set with a given initial capacity.

``` source
init(capacity numItems: Int)
```

## Parameters 

`numItems`  

The initial capacity of the new ordered set.

## Return Value

An initialized mutable ordered set with initial capacity to hold `numItems` members.

## Discussion

Mutable ordered sets allocate additional memory as needed, so `numItems` simply establishes the setâ€™s initial capacity.

This method is a designated initializer of `NSMutableOrderedSet`.
