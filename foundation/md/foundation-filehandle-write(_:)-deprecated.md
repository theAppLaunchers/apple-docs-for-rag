func write(_ data: Data)
```

Deprecated

To handle errors when writing data to the file handle, use write(contentsOf:) in Swift and writeData:error: in Objective-C.

## Parameters 

`data`  

The data to write to the file handle.

## Discussion

If the handle represents a file, writing takes place at the file pointer’s current position. After it writes the data, the method advances the file pointer by the number of bytes written.

Important

This method raises fileHandleOperationException if the file descriptor is closed or isn’t valid, if the handle represents an unconnected pipe or socket endpoint, if there isn’t any free space on the file system, or if any other writing error occurs.
