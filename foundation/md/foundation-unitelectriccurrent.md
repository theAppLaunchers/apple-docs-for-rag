## Overview

You typically use instances of UnitElectricCurrent to represent specific quantities of electric current using the NSMeasurement class.

### Electric Current

Electric current is the flow of electric charge. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), which is defined in terms the production of electromagnetic force between two parallel linear conductors. It can also be expressed as the flow of one coulomb per second (1A = 1C / s).

The UnitElectricCurrent class defines its baseUnit() as amperes, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:

| Name | Method | Symbol | Coefficient |
|----|----|----|----|
| Megaamperes | megaamperes | MA | `1000000.0` |
| Kiloamperes | kiloamperes | kA | `1000.0` |
| Amperes | amperes | A | `1.0` |
| Milliamperes | milliamperes | mA | `0.001` |
| Microamperes | microamperes | ÂµA | `0.000001` |
