## Discussion

This property controls whether tasks within sessions based on this configuration should automatically provide cookies from the shared cookie store when making requests.

If you want to provide cookies yourself, set this value to false and provide a `Cookie` header either through the sessionâ€™s httpAdditionalHeaders property or on a per-request level using a custom NSURLRequest object.

The default value is true.
