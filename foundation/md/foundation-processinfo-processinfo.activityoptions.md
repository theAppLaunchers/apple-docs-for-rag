``` source
struct ActivityOptions
```

## Overview

To include one of these individual flags in one of the sets, use bitwise `OR`; for example, during a presentation you might use:

```
NSActivityUserInitiated | NSActivityIdleDisplaySleepDisabled
```

To exclude from one of the sets, use bitwise `AND` with `NOT`; for example, during a user initiated action that may be safely terminated with no application interaction in case of logout you might use:

```
NSActivityUserInitiated & ~NSActivitySuddenTerminationDisabled
```
