Specifies an array of scheduled user notifications that have not yet been delivered.

macOS 10.8â€“11.0Deprecated

``` source
var scheduledNotifications: [NSUserNotification] { get set }
```

Deprecated

All NSUserNotifications API should be replaced with UserNotifications.frameworks API

## Discussion

Newly scheduled notifications are added to the end of the array. You may also bulk-schedule notifications by setting this array. Bulk setting new scheduled notifications unschedules existing notifications.

Note

The scheduled user notification could be changing to a delivered notification at the time you are calling this method. and if that case the user notification will still be delivered.
