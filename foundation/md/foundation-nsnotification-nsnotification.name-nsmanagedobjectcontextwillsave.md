## Discussion

This notification’s `object` is the context that’s about to save. Only use the notification to operate on the in-process save operation. For example, to insert additional managed objects. Don’t peform any asynchronous work or block the calling thread. NSManagedObjectContext posts notifications to the same thread that creates it.

There is no `userInfo` dictionary.
