``` source
func replaceCharacters(
    in range: NSRange,
    with str: String
)
```

## Parameters 

`range`  

A range specifying the characters to replace.

`str`  

A string specifying the characters to replace those in `range`.

## Discussion

The new characters inherit the attributes of the first replaced character from `range`. Where the length of `range` is 0, the new characters inherit the attributes of the character preceding `range` if it has any, otherwise of the character following `range`.

Raises an rangeException if any part of `range` lies beyond the end of the receiverâ€™s characters.
