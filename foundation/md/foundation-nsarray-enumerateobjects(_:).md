``` source
func enumerateObjects(_ block: (Any, Int, UnsafeMutablePointer) -> Void)
```

## Parameters 

`block`  

A closure or block to execute for each object in the array, taking three arguments:

- The object.

- The index of the object in the array.

- A reference to a Boolean value, which the closure can set to true in order to stop further enumeration of the array. If a closure stops further enumeration, that closure continues to run until itâ€™s finished.

## Discussion

This method executes synchronously. Values allocated within the block are deallocated after the block is executed.
