Instance Method

# symbolicLinkDestination()

Provides the pathname referenced by the file wrapper object, which must be a symbolic-link file wrapper.

macOS 10.0â€“10.10Deprecated

``` source
func symbolicLinkDestination() -> String
```

Deprecated

Use symbolicLinkDestinationURL instead.

## Return Value

Pathname the file wrapper references (the destination of the symbolic link the file wrapper represents).

## Discussion

Beginning with OS X v10.6, the preferred method of referring to files is with a `file://` URL. Therefore, this method has been deprecated in favor of symbolicLinkDestinationURL.

This method raises `NSInternalInconsistencyException` if the receiver is not a symbolic-link file wrapper.
