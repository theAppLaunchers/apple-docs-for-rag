    withCString bytes: UnsafePointer,
    length: Int
) -> Any?
```

Deprecated

Use init(CString:encoding:) instead.

## Discussion

`cString` must not be NULL. `cString` should contain characters in the default C-string encoding. This method converts `length` \* `sizeof(char)` bytes from `cString` and doesn’t stop short at a `NULL` character.
