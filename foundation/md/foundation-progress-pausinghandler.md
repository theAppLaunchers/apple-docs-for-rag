## Discussion

If the receiver is a suboperation of another progress object, the system invokes the pausingHandler block when pausing the containing progress object.

### Special Considerations

Youâ€™re responsible for pausing any work for the progress object.

You can invoke the pausing handler on any queue. If you must do work on a specific queue, dispatch to that queue from within the pausing handler block.
