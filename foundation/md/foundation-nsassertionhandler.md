## Overview

`NSAssertionHandler` objects are automatically created to handle false assertions. Assertion macros, such as `NSAssert` and `NSCAssert`, are used to evaluate a condition, and if the condition evaluates to false, the macros pass a string to an `NSAssertionHandler` object describing the failure. Each thread has its own `NSAssertionHandler` object. When invoked, an assertion handler prints an error message that includes the method and class (or function) containing the assertion and raises an `NSInternalInconsistencyException`.

You create assertions only using the assertion macrosâ€”you rarely need to invoke `NSAssertionHandler` methods directly. The macros for use inside methods and functions send handleFailureInMethod:object:file:lineNumber:description: and handleFailureInFunction:file:lineNumber:description: messages respectively to the current assertion handler. The assertion handler for the current thread is obtained using the current class method. See doc:nsassertionhandler/nsassertionhandlerkey/nsassertionhandlerkey if you need to customize the behavior of NSAssertionHandler.
