# init(forReadingAtPath:)

Returns a file handle initialized for reading the file, device, or named socket at the specified path.

``` source
convenience init?(forReadingAtPath path: String)
```

## Parameters 

`path`  

The path to the file, device, or named socket to access.

## Return Value

The initialized file handle object or `nil` if no file exists at `path`.

## Discussion

The system sets the file pointer to the beginning of the file. You canâ€™t write data to the returned file handle object. Use the readDataToEndOfFile() or readData(ofLength:) methods to read data from it.

When using this method to create a file handle object, the file handle owns its associated file descriptor and is responsible for closing it.
