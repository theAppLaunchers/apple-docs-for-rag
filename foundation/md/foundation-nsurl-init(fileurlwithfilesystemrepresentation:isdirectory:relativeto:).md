# init(fileURLWithFileSystemRepresentation:isDirectory:relativeTo:)

Initializes a URL object with a C string representing a local file system path.

``` source
init(
    fileURLWithFileSystemRepresentation path: UnsafePointer,
    isDirectory isDir: Bool,
    relativeTo baseURL: URL?
)
```

## Parameters 

`path`  

A null-terminated C string in file system representation containing the path to represent as a URL. If this path is a relative path, it is treated as being relative to the current working directory.

`isDir`  

true if the last path part is a directory, otherwise false.

`baseURL`  

The base URL for the new URL object. This must be a file URL. If `path` is absolute, this URL is ignored.

## Return Value

Returns the initialized object.

## Discussion

The file system representation format is described in File Encodings and Fonts.
