Instance Property

# scriptErrorString

Sets a script error string that is associated with execution of the command.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
var scriptErrorString: String? { get set }
```

## Parameters 

`errorString`  

A string that describes an error.

## Discussion

If you override performDefaultImplementation() and an error occurs, you should call this method to supply a string that provides a useful explanation. In fact, any script handler should call this method when an error occurs.

Calling this method alone does not cause an error message to be displayedâ€”you must also call scriptErrorNumber to supply an error number.
