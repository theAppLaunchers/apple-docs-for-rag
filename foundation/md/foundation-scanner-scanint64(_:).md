Instance Method

# scanInt64(\_:)

Scans for a long long value from a decimal representation, returning a found value by reference.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func scanInt64(_ result: UnsafeMutablePointer?) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`result`  

Upon return, contains the scanned value. Contains `LLONG_MAX` or `LLONG_MIN` on overflow.

## Return Value

true if the receiver finds a valid decimal integer representation, otherwise false. Overflow is considered a valid decimal integer representation.

## Discussion

All overflow digits are skipped. Skips past excess digits in the case of overflow, so the receiverâ€™s position is past the entire decimal representation.

Invoke this method with `NULL` as `longLongValue` to simply scan past a long decimal integer representation.
