## Discussion

The exact format depends on the locale. Possible values of date interval style include: omitted, numeric, abbreviated, long, and complete.

The following code sample shows a variety of date interval style format results using the `en_US` locale.

```
if let today = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -120, to: Date()),
   let thirtyDaysBeforeToday = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -30, to: today) {
   // today: Apr 11, 2021 at 7:14 AM
   // thirtyDaysBeforeToday: Mar 12, 2021 at 7:14 AM

   // Create a Range.
   let last30days = thirtyDaysBeforeToday..

The default date style is `numeric`.
