``` source
func matchesContents(of url: URL) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`url`  

URL of the file-system node with which to compare the file wrapper.

## Return Value

true when the contents of the file wrapper match the contents of `url`, false otherwise.

## Discussion

The contents of files are not compared; matching of regular files is based on file modification dates. For a directory, children are compared against the files in the directory, recursively.

Because children of directory file wrappers are not read immediately by the init(url:options:) method unless the `NSFileWrapperReadingImmediate` reading option is used, even a newly-created directory file wrapper might not have the same contents as the directory on disk. You can use this method to determine whether the file wrapperâ€™s contents in memory need to be updated.

If the file wrapper needs updating, use the read(from:options:) method with the `NSFileWrapperReadingImmediate` reading option.

This table describes which attributes of the file wrapper and file-system node are compared to determine whether the file wrapper matches the node on disk:

| File-wrapper type | Comparison determinants                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Regular file      | Modification date and access permissions. |
| Directory         | Children (recursive).                     |
| Symbolic link     | Destination pathname.                     |
