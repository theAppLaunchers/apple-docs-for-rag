## Discussion

This property corresponds to the `cu` key of the Unicode BCP 47 extension.

For locale instances created with the `cu` specifier (such as `en-US@cu=cad`), or with a custom Locale.Components, this property represents the custom currency. Otherwise, it represents the localeâ€™s default currency.
