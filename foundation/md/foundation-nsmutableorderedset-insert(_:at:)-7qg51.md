Instance Method

# insert(\_:at:)

Inserts the given object at the specified index of the mutable ordered set, if it is not already a member.

``` source
func insert(
    _ object: Any,
    at idx: Int
)
```

## Parameters 

`object`  

The object to insert into the setâ€™s content.

`idx`  

The index in the mutable ordered set at which to insert `object`. This value must not be greater than the count of elements in the array.

Important

Important: Raises an rangeException if `idx` is greater than the number of elements in the mutable ordered set.

## Discussion

If the object is already a member, this method has no effect. If the specified index is already occupied, the objects at that index and beyond are shifted by adding `1` to their indexes to make room for the inserted object.
