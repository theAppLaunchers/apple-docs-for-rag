Returns a counted set object initialized with enough memory to hold a given number of objects.

``` source
init(capacity numItems: Int)
```

## Parameters 

`numItems`  

The initial capacity of the new counted set.

## Return Value

A counted set object initialized with enough memory to hold `numItems` objects

## Discussion

The method is the designated initializer for NSCountedSet.

Note that the capacity is simply a hint to help initial memory allocationâ€”the initial count of the object is `0`, and the set still grows and shrinks as you add and remove objects. The hint is typically useful if the set will become large.
