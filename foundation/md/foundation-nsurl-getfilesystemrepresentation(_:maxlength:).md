    _ buffer: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    maxLength maxBufferLength: Int
) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`buffer`  

A buffer large enough to hold the path. On return, contains a null-terminated C string in file system representation.

`maxBufferLength`  

The size of `buffer` in bytes (typically `MAXPATHLEN` or `PATH_MAX`).
