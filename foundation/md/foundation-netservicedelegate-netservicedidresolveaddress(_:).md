optional func netServiceDidResolveAddress(_ sender: NetService)
```

## Parameters 

`sender`  

The service that was resolved.

## Discussion

The delegate can use the addresses method to retrieve the serviceâ€™s address. If the delegate needs only one address, it can stop the resolution process using stop(). Otherwise, the resolution will continue until the timeout specified in resolve(withTimeout:) is reached.
