## Discussion

To create a URL session for use by an app extension, set this property to a valid identifier for a container shared between the app extension and its containing app.

Important

If you try to create a URL session from your app extension but fail to set this property to a valid value, the URL session is invalidated upon creation.

For information about app extensions, see App Extension Programming Guide.
