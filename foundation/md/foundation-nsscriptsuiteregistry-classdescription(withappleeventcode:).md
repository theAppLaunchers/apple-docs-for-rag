func classDescription(withAppleEventCode appleEventCode: FourCharCode) -> NSScriptClassDescription?
```

## Discussion

Overriding behavior is important here. Multiple classes can have the same code if the classes have an uninterrupted linear inheritance from one another. For example, if class B is a subclass of A and class C is a subclass of B, and all three classes have the same four-character Apple event code, then this method returns the class description for class C.
