## Discussion

This property contains an array of `NSOperation` objects. To add an object to this array, use the addDependency(_:) method.

An operation object must not execute until all of its dependent operations finish executing. Operations are not removed from this dependency list as they finish executing. You can use this list to track all dependent operations, including those that have already finished executing. The only way to remove an operation from this list is to use the removeDependency(_:) method.
