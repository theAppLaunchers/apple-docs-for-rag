## Overview

Use the methods of this class to access, create, and manage file revisions in your app.

Each file version instance contains metadata about a single revision, including the location of the associated file, the modification date of the revision, and whether the revision is discardable.

In Mac apps, you can use file version objects to track changes to a local file over time and to prevent the loss of data during editing. When managing local versions, the document architecture creates versions at specific points in the lifetime of your application. Your application can also create versions explicitly at times that your application designates as appropriate.

In addition to managing local files, the system also uses this class to manage cloud-based files. For files in the cloud, there is usually only one version of the file at any given time. However, additional file versions may be created in cases where two different computers attempt to save the file to the cloud at the same time. In that case, one file is chosen as the current version and any other versions are tagged as being in conflict with the original. Conflict versions are reported to the appropriate file presenter objects and should be resolved as soon as possible so that the corresponding files can be removed from the cloud.

class func unresolvedConflictVersionsOfItem(at: URL) -> [NSFileVersion]?

Returns an array of version objects that are currently in conflict for the specified URL.

### Replacing and Deleting Versions

func replaceItem(at: URL, options: NSFileVersion.ReplacingOptions) throws -> URL

Replace the contents of the specified file with the contents of the current versionâ€™s file.

func remove() throws
