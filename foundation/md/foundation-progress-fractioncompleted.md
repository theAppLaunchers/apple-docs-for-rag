## Discussion

If the receiver object doesnâ€™t have any suboperations, fractionCompleted is generally the result of dividing completedUnitCount by totalUnitCount. Setting both totalUnitCount and completedUnitCount properties to zero indicates that there is no progress to track. In this case, the isIndeterminate property returns false and the fractionCompleted property returns `0.0`.

If the receiver does have suboperations, fractionCompleted reflects progress from those progress objects in addition to its own completedUnitCount. When the suboperations finish, the completedUnitCount of the containing progress object updates.
