## Overview

The `NSURLConnectionDownloadDelegate` protocol describes methods that should be implemented by the delegate of instances of `NSURLConnection` created using Newsstand Kitâ€™s `download(with:)` method. The methods in this protocol provide progress information about the download of a URL asset and, when downloading concludes, provide a file URL where the downloaded file can be accessed.

In addition to the methods described in this protocol, an `NSURLConnection` delegate should also implement the methods described in the NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol.

Note

If you are using `NSURLConnection` directly, your delegate class should instead implement the methods defined in the NSURLConnectionDataDelegate protocol.

## Topics

### Managing Downloads of URL Assets

func connection(NSURLConnection, didWriteData: Int64, totalBytesWritten: Int64, expectedTotalBytes: Int64)

Sent to the delegate to deliver progress information for a download of a URL asset to a destination file.

func connectionDidResumeDownloading(NSURLConnection, totalBytesWritten: Int64, expectedTotalBytes: Int64)

Sent to the delegate when an URL connection resumes downloading a URL asset that was earlier suspended.

func connectionDidFinishDownloading(NSURLConnection, destinationURL: URL)

Sent to the delegate when the URL connection has successfully downloaded the URL asset to a destination file.
