## Overview

You typically use instances of UnitLength to represent specific quantities of length using the NSMeasurement class.

### Length

Length is the dimensional extent of matter. The SI unit for length is the meter (m), which is defined in terms of the distance traveled by light in a vacuum.

The UnitLength class defines its baseUnit() as meters, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:

| Name | Method | Symbol | Coefficient |
|----|----|----|----|
| Megameters | megameters | Mm | `1000000.0` |
| Kilometers | kilometers | kM | `1000.0` |
| Hectometers | hectometers | hm | `100.0` |
| Decameters | decameters | dam | `10.0` |
| Meters | meters | m | `1.0` |
| Decimeters | decimeters | dm | `0.1` |
| Centimeters | centimeters | cm | `0.01` |
| Millimeters | millimeters | mm | `0.001` |
| Micrometers | micrometers | Âµm | `0.000001` |
| Nanometers | nanometers | nm | `1e-9` |
| Picometers | picometers | pm | `1e-12` |
| Inches | inches | in | `0.0254` |
| Feet | feet | ft | `0.3048` |
| Yards | yards | yd | `0.9144` |
| Miles | miles | mi | `1609.34` |
| Scandinavian Miles | scandinavianMiles | smi | `10000` |
| Light Years | lightyears | ly | `9.461e+15` |
| Nautical Miles | nauticalMiles | NM | `1852` |
| Fathoms | fathoms | ftm | `1.8288` |
| Furlongs | furlongs | fur | `201.168` |
| Astronomical Units | astronomicalUnits | ua | `1.496e+11` |
| Parsecs | parsecs | pc | `3.086e+16` |
