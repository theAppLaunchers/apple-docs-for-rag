## Discussion

All listeners start suspended and must be resumed before they begin processing incoming requests.

If called on the service() object, this method never returns. Therefore, you should call it as the last step inside the XPC serviceâ€™s `main` function after setting up any desired initial state and configuring the listener itself.

If called on any other NSXPCListener, the connection is resumed, and the method returns immediately.
