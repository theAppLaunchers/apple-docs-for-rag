## Discussion

The observers can then issue the appropriate messages to begin reading the data. To cause the posting of this notification, you must send either waitForDataInBackgroundAndNotify() or waitForDataInBackgroundAndNotify(forModes:) to an appropriate `NSFileHandle` object.

The notification object is the `NSFileHandle` object that sent the notification. This notification doesnâ€™t contain a `userInfo` dictionary.
