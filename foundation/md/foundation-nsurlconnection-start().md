## Discussion

Calling this method is necessary only if you create a connection with the init(request:delegate:startImmediately:) method and provide false for the `startImmediately` parameter. If you donâ€™t schedule the connection in a run loop or an operation queue before calling this method, the connection is scheduled in the current run loop in the default mode.
