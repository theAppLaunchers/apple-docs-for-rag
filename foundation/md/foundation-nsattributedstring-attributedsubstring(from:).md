func attributedSubstring(from range: NSRange) -> NSAttributedString
```

## Parameters

## Return Value

An `NSAttributedString` object consisting of the characters and attributes within `aRange` in the receiver.

## Discussion

Raises an rangeException if any part of `aRange` lies beyond the end of the receiverâ€™s characters. This method treats the length of the string as a valid range value that returns an empty string.
