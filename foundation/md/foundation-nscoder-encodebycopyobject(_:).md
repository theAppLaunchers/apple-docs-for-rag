Instance Method

# encodeBycopyObject(\_:)

An encoding method for subclasses to override such that it creates a copy, rather than a proxy, when decoded.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func encodeBycopyObject(_ anObject: Any?)
```

## Discussion

`NSCoder`â€™s implementation simply invokes encode(_:).

This method must be matched by a corresponding decodeObject() message.
