## Discussion

The object in the user info dictionary for the key NSHelpAnchorErrorKey. If the user info dictionary doesnâ€™t contain a value for NSHelpAnchorErrorKey, this property is `nil`.

If this property is non-`nil` for an error being presented by init(error:), the alert panel will include a help anchor button that can display this string.
