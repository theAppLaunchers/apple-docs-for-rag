func addOperation(_ block: @escaping () -> Void)
```

## Parameters 

`block`  

The block to execute from the operation. The block takes no parameters and has no return value.

## Discussion

This method adds a single block to the receiver by first wrapping it in an operation object. You should not attempt to get a reference to the newly created operation object or determine its type information.
