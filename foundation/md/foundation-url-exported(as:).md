``` source
func exported(as contentType: UTType?) async throws -> Data
```

## Parameters 

`contentType`  

A content type of the returned data. If no content type is provided, CoreTransferable generates data using the first `TransferRepresentation` in the `Transferable` conformance that supports export.

## Discussion

If the `Transferable` is backed by a file `URL`, this might cause loading the entire file contents into memory. This function uses the first representation that conforms to the given content type in `static var transferRepresentation` requirement of the `Transferable` protocol or in the `var body` property of a custom `TransferRepresentation`.

The default implementation of this function is available to all types that conform to `Transferable` protocol.
