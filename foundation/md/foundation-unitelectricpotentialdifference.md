## Overview

You typically use instances of UnitElectricPotentialDifference to represent specific quantities of electric potential difference using the NSMeasurement class.

### Electric Potential Difference

Electric potential difference is the amount of electric potential energy of a point charge at a point in space. The SI unit for electric potential difference is the volt (V), which is derived as the difference in electric potential energy between two points of a linear conductor when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points (1V = 1W/1A).

The UnitElectricPotentialDifference class defines its baseUnit() as volts, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:

| Name | Method | Symbol | Coefficient |
|----|----|----|----|
| Megavolts | megavolts | MV | `1000000.0` |
| Kilovolts | kilovolts | kV | `1000.0` |
| Volts | volts | V | `1.0` |
| Millivolts | millivolts | mV | `0.001` |
| Microvolts | microvolts | ÂµV | `0.000001` |
