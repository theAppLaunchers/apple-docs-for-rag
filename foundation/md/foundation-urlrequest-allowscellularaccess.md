var allowsCellularAccess: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Setting this property to `true` makes the request eligible to run over cellular, subject to other considerations (including, but not limited to, the URLSessionConfigurationâ€™s allowsCellularAccess property). Setting this value to `false` ensures that the request will never run over cellular.
