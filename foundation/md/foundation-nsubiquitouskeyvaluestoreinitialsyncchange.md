## Discussion

Your attempt to write to key-value storage was discarded because an initial download from iCloud has not yet happened. That is, before you can first write key-value data, the system must ensure that your appâ€™s local, on-disk cache matches the truth in iCloud.

Initial downloads happen the first time a device is connected to an iCloud account, and when a user switches their primary iCloud account.
