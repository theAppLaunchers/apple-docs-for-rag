Initializer

# init(block:arguments:)

Creates an expression object that uses the block for evaluating objects.

``` source
init(
    block: @escaping (Any?, [NSExpression], NSMutableDictionary?) -> Any,
    arguments: [NSExpression]?
)
```

## Parameters 

`block`  

The Block is applied to the object to be evaluated.

The Block takes three arguments and returns a value:

evaluatedObject  
The object to be evaluated.

expressions  
An array of predicate expressions that evaluates to a collection.

context  
A dictionary that the expression can use to store temporary state for one predicate evaluation.

Note that `context` is mutable, and that it can only be accessed during the evaluation of the expression. You must not attempt to retain it for use elsewhere. \]

The Block returns the `evaluatedObject`.

`arguments`  

An array containing `NSExpression` objects that will be used as parameters during the invocation of selector.

For a selector taking no parameters, the array should be empty. For a selector taking one or more parameters, the array should contain one `NSExpression` object which will evaluate to an instance of the appropriate type for each parameter.

If there is a mismatch between the number of parameters expected and the number you provide during evaluation, an exception may be raised or missing parameters may simply be replaced by `nil` (which occurs depends on how many parameters are provided, and whether you have over- or underflow).

See init(forFunction:arguments:) for a complete list of arguments.

## Return Value

An expression that filters a collection using the specified Block.
