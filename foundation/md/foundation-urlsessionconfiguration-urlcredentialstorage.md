## Discussion

This property determines the credential storage object used by tasks within sessions based on this configuration.

If you donâ€™t want to use a credential store, set this property to `nil`.

For default and background sessions, the default value is the shared credential store object.

For ephemeral sessions, the default value is a private credential store object that stores data in memory only, and is destroyed when you invalidate the session.
