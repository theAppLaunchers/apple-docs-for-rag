## Discussion

The request body of the receiver will be this input stream. The entire contents of the stream will be sent as the body, as in an HTTP `POST` request. The input stream should be unopened and the receiver will take over as the streamâ€™s delegate.

Setting a body stream clears any data in httpBody. These values are mutually exclusive.
