## Discussion

To donate a user activity to Siri Shortcuts, set isEligibleForPrediction to true and make the user activity current. To make the user activity current, call the activityâ€™s becomeCurrent() method, or assign it to the userActivity property on a UIViewController or UIResponder object.
