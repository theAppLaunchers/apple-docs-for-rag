Instance Method

# image(forResource:)

Returns an `NSImage` instance associated with the specified name, which can be backed by multiple files representing different resolution versions of the image.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
func image(forResource name: NSImage.Name) -> NSImage?
```

## Parameters 

`name`  

The filename of the image resource file. Including a filename extension is optional.

## Return Value

The `NSImage` object associated with the specified name, or `nil` if no file is found.

## Discussion

This method accommodates Appleâ€™s naming conventions for high-resolution versions of the image. For example, if your bundle contains files named `button.png`, `button@2x.png`, and `button.pdf` then `imageForResource:@"button"` returns an `NSImage` object backed by all three files. Each time the `NSImage` object is drawn, it selects the representation best for the drawing context.

Images requested using this method whose name ends in the word `Template` are automatically marked as template images.

This method does not look up images based on setName(_:) or get named system images. Use init(named:) for that purpose.

This method does not cache its search results.
