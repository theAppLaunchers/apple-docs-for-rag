## Discussion

The setter combines an array containing any number of URLQueryItem key-value pairs into a query string and sets the `URLComponents` query property. This property assumes the query item names and values are already correctly percent-encoded. It also assumes that the query item names donâ€™t contain the query item delimiter characters `&` and `=`. Attempting to set an incorrectly percent-encoded query item or a query item name with the query item delimiter characters `&` and `=` raises fatalError(_:file:line:).
