## Overview

The TVML frameworks provide several built-in ways to play media items. After loading the initial page, the app automatically plays music in the background. The user navigates between two images and the app loads and plays a video or audio media item after the user selects an image. Both of these media items play using the built-in TVMLJKit JS media player.
