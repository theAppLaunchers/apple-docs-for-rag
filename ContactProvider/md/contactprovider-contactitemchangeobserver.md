# ContactItemChangeObserver

A protocol that defines a system observer that receives a resumable enumeration of changed contact items.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+

``` source
protocol ContactItemChangeObserver
```

## Overview

Your implementation of enumerateChanges(startingAt:for:) receives an observer that conforms to this type. As you enumerate over your contacts, you provide them to the observer with the didUpdate(_:) and didDelete(_:) methods.

func didDelete([ContactItem.Identifier])

struct Identifier

### Ending enumeration

func didFinishEnumeratingChanges(upTo: ContactItemSyncAnchor, moreComing: Bool)

Marks a sync anchor of changed contact items as completed.

**Required**

struct ContactItemSyncAnchor

A snapshot point into enumerating changed contact items.

func didFinishEnumeratingChangesWithError(any Error)

Finishes the change enumeration with an error, indicating failure, to the observer.
