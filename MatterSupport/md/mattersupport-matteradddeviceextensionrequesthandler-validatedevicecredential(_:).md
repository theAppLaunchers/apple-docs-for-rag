Instance Method

Performs verification and attestation checks.

``` source
func validateDeviceCredential(_ deviceCredential: MatterAddDeviceExtensionRequestHandler.DeviceCredential) async throws
```

## Overview

Override this method to perform additional verification and attestation checks, which execute after Appleâ€™s built-in device attestation checks. If either attestation fails as indicated by an exception thrown here, a warning dialog appears before proceeding.

This is the first callback that the system invokes during the setup flow. It runs after selecting a device but before commissioning, and can abort commissioning if the credential is rejected by throwing an exception.
