## Discussion

Provides the URL for a new tab page, if provided by the extension; otherwise `nil` if no page is defined.

The app should prompt the user for permission to use the extensionâ€™s new tab page as the default.

Note

Navigation to the override new tab page is only possible after this extension has been loaded.
