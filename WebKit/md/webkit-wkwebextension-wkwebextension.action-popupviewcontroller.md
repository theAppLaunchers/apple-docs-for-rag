## Discussion

The view controller adaptively adjusts its presentation style based on where it is presented from, preferring popover.

It contains a web view preloaded with the pop-up page and automatically adjusts its `preferredContentSize` to fit the web viewâ€™s content size. The presentsPopup property should be checked to determine the availability of a pop-up before using this property.

Dismissing the view controller will close the pop-up and unload the web view.
