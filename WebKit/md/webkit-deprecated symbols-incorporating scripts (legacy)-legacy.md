WebScripting

\`WebScripting\` is an informal protocol that defines methods that classes can implement to export their interfaces to a WebScript environment such as JavaScript.

class WebUndefined

`WebUndefined` objects are simply used to represent the JavaScript “undefined” value in methods when bridging between JavaScript and Objective-C. For example, if you invoke a JavaScript function that returns the JavaScript “undefined” value, then a `WebUndefined` object is returned to the Objective-C calling context.
