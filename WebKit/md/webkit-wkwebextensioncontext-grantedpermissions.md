## Discussion

Permissions that donâ€™t expire will have a distant future date. This will never include expired entries at time of access.

Setting this property will replace all existing entries. Use this property for saving and restoring permission status in bulk.

Permissions in this dictionary should be explicitly granted by the user before being added. Any permissions in this collection will not be presented for approval again until they expire. This value should be saved and restored as needed by the app.
