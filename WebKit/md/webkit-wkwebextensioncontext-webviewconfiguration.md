## Discussion

Returns a customized copy of the configuration, originally set in the web extension controller configuration, for this extension.

The app must use this configuration when initializing web views intended to navigate to a URL originating from this extension’s base URL.

The app must also swap web views in tabs when navigating to and from web extension URLs. This property returns `nil` if the context isn’t associated with a web extension controller. The returned configuration copy can be customized prior to web view initialization.

Note

Navigations will fail if a web view using this configuration attempts to navigate to a URL that doesn’t originate from this extension’s base URL. Similarly, navigations will be canceled if a web view not configured with this configuration attempts to navigate to a URL that does originate from this extension’s base URL.
