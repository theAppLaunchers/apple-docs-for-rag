```

## Overview

A WKWindowFeatures object contains the attributes that a webpage requests from its containing web view. You donâ€™t create a WKWindowFeatures object directly. When a navigation action results in the display of a new web view, WKWebView creates this object and passes it to the webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:) method of its UI delegate object. The delegate uses the information in this object to configure and return the new web view.
