## Discussion

true if the web views should use a page cache; otherwise, false.

Pages are cached when they are added to a back-forward list, and removed from the cache when they are removed from a back-forward list. Because the page cache is global, caching a page in one back-forward list may cause a page in another back-forward list to be removed from the cache.
