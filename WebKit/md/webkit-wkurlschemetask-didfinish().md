## Discussion

This method signals to WebKit that it has all of the resourceâ€™s data and the task is now complete. Call this method after sending a response and the resource data to WebKit using the didReceive(_:) and didReceive(_:) methods.

This method raises an exception if you call it before the didReceive(_:) method, or if the task is already complete. It also raises an exception if you call it after WebKit calls the webView(_:stop:) method of the corresponding handler object.
