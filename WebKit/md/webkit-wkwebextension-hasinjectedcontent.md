var hasInjectedContent: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

If this property is `YES`, the extension has content that can be injected by matching against the extensionâ€™s requested match patterns.

Note

Once the extension is loaded, use the hasInjectedContent property on an extension context, as the injectable content can change after the extension is loaded.
