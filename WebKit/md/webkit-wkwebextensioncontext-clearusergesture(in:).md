iOS 18.4+iPadOS 18.4+Mac Catalyst 18.4+macOS 15.4+visionOS 2.4+

``` source
@MainActor
func clearUserGesture(in tab: any WKWebExtensionTab)
```

## Parameters 

`tab`  

The tab from which the user gesture should be cleared.

## Discussion

When a user gesture is no longer relevant in a tab, this method should be called to update the extension context.

This will revoke the extensionâ€™s access to features that require active user interaction, such as `activeTab`. User gestures are automatically cleared during navigation in certain scenarios; this method is needed if the app intends to clear the gesture more aggressively.
