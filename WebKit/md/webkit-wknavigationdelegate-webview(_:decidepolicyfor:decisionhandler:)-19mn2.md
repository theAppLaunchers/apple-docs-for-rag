Replacing UIWebView in your app

## Discussion

Use this method to allow or deny a navigation request after the web view receives the response to its original URL request. The `navigationResponse` parameter contains the details of the response, including the type of data that the response contains. If you implement this method, always execute the `decisionHandler` block at some point. You may execute it synchronously from your delegate methodâ€™s implementation, or execute it asynchronously after your method returns.
