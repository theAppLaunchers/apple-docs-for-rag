iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.10+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
@MainActor
optional func webView(
    _ webView: WKWebView,
    didCommit navigation: WKNavigation!
)
```

## Parameters 

`webView`  

The web view that is loading the content.

`navigation`  

The navigation object that uniquely identifies the load request.

## Discussion

After the navigation delegateâ€™s webView(_:decidePolicyFor:decisionHandler:) method approves the navigation response, the web view begins processing it. As changes become ready, the web view calls this method immediately before it starts to update the main frame.
