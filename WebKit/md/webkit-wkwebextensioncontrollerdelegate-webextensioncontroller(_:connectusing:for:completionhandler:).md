Instance Method

# webExtensionController(\_:connectUsing:for:completionHandler:)

Called when an extension context wants to establish a persistent connection to an application.

iOS 18.4+iPadOS 18.4+Mac Catalyst 18.4+macOS 15.4+visionOS 2.4+

``` source
@MainActor
optional func webExtensionController(
    _ controller: WKWebExtensionController,
    connectUsing port: WKWebExtension.MessagePort,
    for extensionContext: WKWebExtensionContext,
    completionHandler: @escaping ((any Error)?) -> Void
)
```

``` source
@MainActor
optional func webExtensionController(
    _ controller: WKWebExtensionController,
    connectUsing port: WKWebExtension.MessagePort,
    for extensionContext: WKWebExtensionContext
) async throws
```

## Parameters 

`controller`  

The web extension controller that is managing the extension.

`port`  

A port object for handling the message exchange.

`extensionContext`  

The context in which the web extension is running.

`completionHandler`  

A block to be called when the connection is ready to use, taking an optional error. If the connection is successfully established, the error should be \c nil.

## Discussion

This method should be implemented by the app to handle establishing connections to applications.

The provided WKWebExtension.MessagePort object can be used to handle message sending, receiving, and disconnection.

You should retain the port object for as long as the connection remains active. Releasing the port will disconnect it.

If not implemented, the default behavior is to pass the messages to the app extension handler within the extensionâ€™s bundle, if the extension was loaded from an app extension bundle; otherwise, no action is performed if not implemented.
