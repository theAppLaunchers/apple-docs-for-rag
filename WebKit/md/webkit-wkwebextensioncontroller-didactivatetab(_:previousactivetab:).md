``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
func didActivateTab(
    _ activatedTab: any WKWebExtensionTab,
    previousActiveTab previousTab: (any WKWebExtensionTab)? = nil
)
```

## Parameters 

`activatedTab`  

The tab that has become active.

`previousTab`  

The tab that was active before. This parameter can be \c nil if there was no previously active tab.

## Discussion

This method informs all loaded extensions of the tab activation, ensuring consistent state awareness across extensions.

If the intention is to inform only a specific extension, use the respective method on that extensionâ€™s context instead.
