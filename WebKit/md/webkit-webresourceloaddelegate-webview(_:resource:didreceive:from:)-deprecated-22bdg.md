Instance Method

# webView(\_:resource:didReceive:from:)

Invoked after a resource has been loaded.

macOS 10.3â€“10.14Deprecated

``` source
optional func webView(
    _ sender: WebView!,
    resource identifier: Any!,
    didReceive response: URLResponse!,
    from dataSource: WebDataSource!
)
```

## Parameters 

`sender`  

The web view that sent this message.

`identifier`  

An identifier object used to track the resource being loaded by `dataSource`.

`response`  

The reply that was received.

`dataSource`  

The data source for this web view.

## Discussion

In some rare cases, multiple responses may be received for a single resource. This happens in the case of multipart/x-mixed-replace, also known as a *server push*. In this case, delegates should assume that the progress of loading this resource restarts, and the expected content length may change.
