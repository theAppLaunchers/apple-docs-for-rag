## Discussion

Provides a UIKeyCommand instance representing the web extension command, ready for integration in the app.

The property is `nil` if no shortcut is defined. Otherwise, the key command is fully configured with the necessary input key and modifier flags to perform the associated command upon activation. It can be included in a view controller or other responderâ€™s keyCommands property, enabling keyboard activation and discoverability of the web extension command.
