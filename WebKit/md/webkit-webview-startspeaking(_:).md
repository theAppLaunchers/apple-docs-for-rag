Instance Method

# startSpeaking(\_:)

An action method that starts speaking the selected text or all text if thereâ€™s no selection.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func startSpeaking(_ sender: Any?)
```

## Parameters 

`sender`  

The object that sent this message.

## Discussion

Speech continues asynchronously until the end of the text or until terminated by invoking the stopSpeaking(_:) method. This method behaves similar to the startSpeaking(_:) method in NSTextView.
