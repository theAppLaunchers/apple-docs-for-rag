## Discussion

This popover contains a view controller with a web view preloaded with the pop-up page. It automatically adjusts its size to fit the web viewâ€™s content size. The presentsPopup property should be checked to determine the availability of a pop-up before using this property. Dismissing the popover will close the pop-up and unload the web view.
