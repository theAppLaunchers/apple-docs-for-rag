## Discussion

Match patterns that donâ€™t expire will have a distant future date. This will never include expired entries at time of access.

Setting this property will replace all existing entries. Use this property for saving and restoring permission status in bulk.

Match patterns in this dictionary should be explicitly denied by the user before being added. Any match pattern in this collection will not be presented for approval again until they expire. This value should be saved and restored as needed by the app.
