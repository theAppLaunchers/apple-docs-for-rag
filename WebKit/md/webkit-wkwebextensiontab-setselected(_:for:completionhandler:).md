`selected`  

A boolean value indicating whether to select the tab.

`context`  

The context in which the web extension is running.

`completionHandler`  

A block that must be called upon completion. It takes a single error argument, which should be provided if any errors occurred.

## Discussion

This is equivalent to the user command-clicking on the tab to add it to or remove it from a selection.

The method should update the tabâ€™s selection state without changing the active tab. No action is performed if not implemented.
