# EntityQueryProperty

An object that provides the supported comparators you use to describe the different ways users can query against a property of an app entity.

## Overview

Entity query properties are defined by by providing a `KeyPath` to an `AppEntity` property in your data model that this property applies to and then specify the set of supported EntityQueryComparators for this property.

`EntityQueryProperty` allows you to define `EntityQueryComparator`s beyond strict equality. The set of comparators available depends on the underlying property type. For example, an `Equatable` property type will allow for `EqualToComparator` and `NotEqualToComparator` comparators while a `Comparable` property type will add support for `GreaterThanComparator`, `GreaterThanOrEqualToComparator`, `LessThanComparator`, and `LessThanOrEqualToComparator` comparators. See `Comparator` for more details on available comparators.

An `EntityQueryProperty` doesnâ€™t necessarily need to apply to a property of its parent Query `Entity`.

Consider the scenario where you have an application containing Photo and Album entities, and you want to support querying photos by the name of their containing album. Within a EntityPropertyQuery in which `Entity` is Photo, you can define a `EntityQueryProperty` mapping to a name property of the Album entity, as long as you supply a closure for `entityProvider` that contains the logic to get from a Photo entity to an Album entity.

See `EntityQueryProperty/init(title:entityProvider:keyPath:)` for details.

## Topics

### Creating queryable properties

typealias QueryComparators

A type alias for the type that represents a collection of query comparators.

enum EntityQueryComparatorsBuilder

A result builder that allows you to declaratively describe the comparators for a queryable property.

### Initializers

convenience init(KeyPath&lt;Subject, Property>, comparators: () -> EntityQueryProperty&lt;Entity, Subject, Property, PropertyType, ComparatorMappingType>.QueryComparators)

Initializes a EntityQueryProperty that applies to entity property at the provided keyPath.

init(KeyPath&lt;Subject, Property>, entityProvider: (Entity) -> Subject, comparators: () -> EntityQueryProperty&lt;Entity, Subject, Property, PropertyType, ComparatorMappingType>.QueryComparators)

Initializes a EntityQueryProperty that applies to entity property at the provided keyPath.
