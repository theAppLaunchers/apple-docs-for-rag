``` source
nonisolated
func searchScopes(
    _ scope: Binding,
    @ViewBuilder scopes: () -> S
) -> some View where V : Hashable, S : View
```

## Parameters 

`scope`  

The active scope of the search field.

`scopes`  

A view builder that represents the scoping options SwiftUI uses to populate a `Picker`.

## Discussion

To enable people to narrow the scope of their searches, you can create a type that represents the possible scopes, and then create a state variable to hold the current selection. For example, you can scope the product search to just fruits or just vegetables:

```
enum ProductScope {
    case fruit
    case vegetable
}

@State private var scope: ProductScope = .fruit
```

Provide a binding to the scope, as well as a view that represents each scope:

```
ProductList()
    .searchable(text: $text, tokens: $tokens) { token in
        switch token {
        case .apple: Text("Apple")
        case .pear: Text("Pear")
        case .banana: Text("Banana")
        }
    }
    .searchScopes($scope) {
        Text("Fruit").tag(ProductScope.fruit)
        Text("Vegetable").tag(ProductScope.vegetable)
    }
```

SwiftUI uses this binding and view to add a `Picker` with the search field. In iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS, the picker appears below the search field when search is active. To ensure that the picker operates correctly, match the type of the scope binding with the type of each viewâ€™s tag. Then modify your search to account for the current value of the `scope` state property.
