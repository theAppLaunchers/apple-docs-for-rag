protocol AudioRecordingIntent : SystemIntent

## Overview

Adopt this protocol to create an app intent for audio recording functionality and tell the system that your app records audio. As a result of this intent, the system displays an audio recording indicator.

Important

In iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS, When you adopt the `AudioRecordingIntent` protocol, you must start a Live Activity when you begin the audio recording and keep it active as long as you record audio. If you don’t start a Live Activity, the audio recording stops.
