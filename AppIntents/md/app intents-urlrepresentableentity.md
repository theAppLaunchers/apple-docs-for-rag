## Overview

Add support for `URLRepresentableEntity` to your app entities to add a URL representation. This allows Siri and Shortcuts to treat the entity like a universal link to specific content, allowing actions to open the URL or to make it sharable.

Note that you need to use a universal link for your URL representation, you canâ€™t use a custom URL scheme. For more information about universal links, see Allowing apps and websites to link to your content.
