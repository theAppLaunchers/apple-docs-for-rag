## Overview

To integrate your appâ€™s functionality with Siri and Apple Intelligence, you use Swift macros that generate additional properties and add protocol conformance for your app intent implementation.

For more information about the `.camera` app intent domain, see Making camera actions available to Siri and Apple Intelligence. For general information about app intent domains, see Integrating actions with Siri and Apple Intelligence.

The following example shows an app intent that conforms to the `.camera.startCapture` schema:

```
@AssistantIntent(schema: .camera.startCapture)
struct StartCameraCaptureIntent: AppIntent {
    @Parameter
    var captureMode: CaptureMode

    @Parameter
    var timerDuration: CaptureDuration?

    @Parameter
    public var device: CaptureDevice?

    func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult {
        .result()
    }
}
```
