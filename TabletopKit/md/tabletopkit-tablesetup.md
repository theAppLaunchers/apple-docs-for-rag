# TableSetup

An object that represents the arrangement of seats, equipment, and counters around the game table.

``` source
struct TableSetup
```

## Overview

To create a `TableSetup` object, pass an object that conforms to the Tabletop or EntityTabletop protocol to the init(tabletop:) initializer. For example, implement a `Table` structure that conforms to the `EntityTabletop` protocol and pass an instance of it to the initializer.

```
let table = Table()
root = createRootEntity(table: table.entity)
var setup = TableSetup(tabletop: table)
```

Set the protocol properties, such as `shape`, `entity`, and `id` properties for the `EntityTabletop` protocol, in the initializer.

```
struct Table: EntityTabletop {
    var shape: TabletopShape
    var entity: Entity
    var id: EquipmentIdentifier

    init() {
        self.entity = try! Entity.load(named: "table/table", in: contentBundle)
        self.shape = .round(entity: entity)
        self.id = .table
    }
}
```

Then add seats, equipment, and counters to the `TableSetup` object.

To represent seats, create structures that conform to a seat protocol. To render seats using RealityKit, conform to the EntityTableSeat protocol and use the add(seat:) or a similar method to add seats. Otherwise, conform to the TableSeat protocol and use the add(seat:) or a similar method to add seats.

```
setup.add(seat: Seat(index: 0, position: .init(x: 0, z: -0.5)))
setup.add(seat: Seat(index: 1, position: .init(x: 0, z: +0.5)))
```

To represent equipment, create structures that conform to an equipment protocol. To render equipment using RealityKit, conform to the EntityEquipment protocol and use the add(equipment:) or a similar method to add equipment. Otherwise, conform to the Equipment protocol and use the add(equipment:) or a similar method to add equipment.

```
setup.add(equipment: Piece(position: .init(x: 0, z: 0.1)))
setup.add(equipment: Card(index: 0, faceUp: true, position: .init(x: -0.1, z: 0)))
setup.add(equipment: Card(index: 1, faceUp: true, position: .init(x: +0.1, z: 0)))
setup.add(equipment: Die(index: 0, position: .init(x: 0, z: 0.2)))
```

Some equipment can represent a group, such as a playerâ€™s hand in a card game. To organize equipment hierarchically, set the parentID property of the State property during gameplay. In your equipment structure implementation, you can override the layoutChildren(for:visualState:) method to lay out the containing equipment.

Optionally, add one or more ScoreCounter objects to the `TableSetup` object to keep score of the game. Use either the add(counter:) or add(counters:) method to add score counters.

Finally, create the TabletopGame instance from the `TableSetup` object by passing it to the init(tableSetup:version:) initializer.

```
game = TabletopGame(tableSetup: setup)
```
