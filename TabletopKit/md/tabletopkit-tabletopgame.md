# TabletopGame

An object that manages the setup and gameplay of a tabletop game.

visionOS 2.0+

``` source
class TabletopGame
```

## Overview

First, create a TableSetup object that represents your game layout and equipment. Add seats for players to occupy, conforming to the TableSeat protocol, and equipment for them to manipulate, conforming to the Equipment protocol.

Pass an object that conforms to the Tabletop or EntityTabletop protocol to the TableSetup initializer.

```
let table = Table()
root = createRootEntity(table: table.entity)
var setup = TableSetup(tabletop: table)
```

Implement your structure to initialize the protocol properties, such as `shape`, `entity`, and `id` properties for the `EntityTabletop` protocol.

```
struct Table: EntityTabletop {
    var shape: TabletopShape
    var entity: Entity
    var id: EquipmentIdentifier

    init() {
        self.entity = try! Entity.load(named: "table/table", in: contentBundle)
        self.shape = .round(entity: entity)
        self.id = .table
    }
}
```

Then, create the `TabletopGame` object that represents your game instance by passing the `TableSetup` object to the init(tableSetup:version:) initializer.

```
game = TabletopGame(tableSetup: setup)
```

Place the localPlayer in a seat at the table using claimSeat(_:) or a similar method.

```
game.claimAnySeat()
```

Next, implement an object that renders your game layout and equipment. Set the gameâ€™s renderer, conforming to the TabletopGame.RenderDelegate protocol, using the addRenderDelegate(_:) method. Implement the onUpdate(timeInterval:snapshot:visualState:) method to render the current state of the game. Alternatively, conform to the EntityRenderDelegate protocol.

```
game.addRenderDelegate(self)
```

If needed, you can draw a debug representation of selected items in the game using the debugDraw(options:) method.

```
game.debugDraw(options: [.drawTable, .drawSeats, .drawEquipment])
```

Then, add actions to the equipment that controls gameplay using the addAction(_:) and addActions(_:) methods.

Finally, pass an object to the addObserver(_:) method that conforms to the TabletopGame.Observer protocol. Implement the `Observer` protocol methods to progress gameplay when players interact with the equipment.

## Topics

### Creating a tabletop game

init(tableSetup: TableSetup, version: Int)

Creates a tabletop game with the specified table configuration and version of rules.

var rootPose: Pose3D

Update the root pose for the current player

func update(deltaTime: Double)

Update the game manually. Call this function if `automaticUpdate` was not set when registering the Tabletop instance.

func withCurrentSnapshot((TableSnapshot) -> Void)

### Adding equipment to the game

var equipment: [any Equipment]

var equipmentIDs: [EquipmentIdentifier]

func equipment(matching: EquipmentIdentifier) -> (any Equipment)?

func equipment&lt;E>(of: E.Type) -> [E]

func equipment&lt;E>(of: E.Type, forEntity: Entity) -> E?

Retrieves the specified equipment type associated with an entity if it exists.

func equipment&lt;E>(of: E.Type, matching: EquipmentIdentifier) -> E?

### Managing seats

func claimAnySeat()

Claims any free seat. If there are no free seats, it has no effect

func claimSeat(some TableSeat)

Claims the given seat. If provided Seat is not part of the table, it has no effect

func claimSeat(matching: TableSeatIdentifier)

Claims the given seat. If provided ID does not exist, it has no effect

func releaseSeat()

Releases the seat for this player. If the player is not seated it has no effect

### Getting the player

var localPlayer: Player

The player who runs this tabletop game instance on their device.

### Adding actions

func addAction(some TabletopAction)

func addActions(some Sequence&lt;any TabletopAction>)

### Observing actions

protocol Observer

A protocol for objects that progress gameplay when players take actions.

func addObserver(some TabletopGame.Observer)

func removeObserver(some TabletopGame.Observer)

enum ActionCancellationReason

The possible reasons for cancelling an action or an interaction.

### Jumping to bookmarks

func jumpToBookmark(StateBookmark)

Restores game to the given bookmark

func jumpToBookmark(matching: StateBookmarkIdentifier)

Restores game to the given bookmark

var bookmarks: [StateBookmarkIdentifier]

### Starting interactions

func startInteraction(onEquipmentID: EquipmentIdentifier) -> TabletopInteraction.Identifier?

Starts a local interaction. It will return `nil` if too many interactions are already happening at the same time.

### Rendering the table

func addRenderDelegate(some TabletopGame.RenderDelegate)

func removeRenderDelegate(some TabletopGame.RenderDelegate)

protocol RenderDelegate

A protocol for the object that renders your entire game.

protocol EntityRenderDelegate

A protocol for the object that renders your entire game using RealityKit.

### Supporting multiple players

func attachNetworkCoordinator(some TabletopNetworkSessionCoordinator)

func detachNetworkCoordinator()

var multiplayerDelegate: (any TabletopGame.MultiplayerDelegate)?

protocol MultiplayerDelegate

An object that handles players joining multiplayer games.

### Enabling group activities

func coordinateWithSession(GroupSession&lt;some GroupActivity>)

### Drawing debug representations

func debugDraw(options: DebugDrawOptions)

Enable or disable debug visualizations
