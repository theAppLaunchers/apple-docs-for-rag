Protocol

# TabletopInteraction.Delegate

A protocol for objects that manage the entire flow of players interacting with equipment.

## Overview

Implement the update(interaction:) method to take an appropriate action depending on the equipment and the phase of the interaction. For example, turn a card face up if a player flips it over or toss a die when a gesture ends. Implement the `shouldAcceptInteraction(initialValue:handoffValue)` method to allow handoff interactions, to provide the initial configuration for new interactions, and to decide if a new interaction should be rejected. If `shouldAcceptInteraction(initialValue:handoffValue)` is not implemented, all handoff interactions will be rejected.

## Topics

### Taking actions

func update(interaction: TabletopInteraction)

**Required**

### Instance Methods

func shouldAcceptInteraction(initialValue: TabletopInteraction.Value, handoffValue: TabletopInteraction.Value?) -> TabletopInteraction.NewInteractionIntent

**Required** Default implementation provided.

## See Also

### Performing actions

func addAction(some TabletopAction)

func addActions(some Sequence&lt;any TabletopAction>)

func toss(equipmentID: EquipmentIdentifier, as: TossableRepresentation, linearVelocity: Vector3D?, angularVelocity: Vector3D?)

Begins a simulation of a toss of the equipment with the specificied parameters. Equipment that begins a toss in the same TabletopInteraction may interact with each other as well as the gameâ€™s boundary.

func end()

Ends the current interaction.

func cancel()

Cancels the current interaction. All actions added to the interaction will also be cancelled.
