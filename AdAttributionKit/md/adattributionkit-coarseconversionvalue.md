Enumeration

# CoarseConversionValue

Values that describe developer-defined, relative-attribution conversion values.

iOS 17.4+iPadOS 17.4+Mac Catalyst

``` source
enum CoarseConversionValue
```

## Overview

Use these values to differentiate between the value of a personâ€™s actions that are meaningful for a specific interaction. These values have no effect on the framework, but calling the updateConversionValue(_:lockPostback:) method with the value with CoarseConversionValue.low, for example, causes the postback that the ad network receives to have a field `"coarse-conversion-value": "low"`.

## Topics
