# audio

Plays background audio for a full-page template when the template is the top-most document in the navigation stack.

## Overview

Each document page that plays audio in the background must have its own `audio` element. If the same URL is used between pages, audio will continue to play when the new page is displayed. The `audio` element only supports unencrypted audio.
