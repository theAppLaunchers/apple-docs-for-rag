# Adding Resource Icons

Add Apple-provided icons to buttons and as independent images.

## Overview

Apple TV contains several icons that are available when you set the `src` attribute on a `badge` element to `resource://`. Here’s an example that sets the preview icon on a button:

```

    Preview

```

Resource icons do not have different variants for dark and light themes. Use the `tv-tint-color` style to change the color of black and white resource icons. Select the appropriate tint for dark and light themes by wrapping the `tv-tint-color` style inside of a media query.
