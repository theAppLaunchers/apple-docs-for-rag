# contentsMode

Specifies how an image is expanded to fill its containing element.

## Overview

Use the `contentsMode` attribute to specify how the image is scaled within its bounding box. Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates the `contentsMode` attribute in a `stackTemplate`:

```

            contentsMode

                        aspectFit

                        aspectFitBB

                        aspectFill

```

Important

When using the `aspectFit` value, you must also include the aspectRatio attribute for the content to scale appropriately.

### Values

aspectFit  
The image scales to fit in the bounding box using fixed aspect ratio. The output bounding box has the same size as the scaled image, leaving no remaining area. The output bounding box may be smaller than its specified size.

aspectFitBB  
The image scales to fit in the bounding box using fixed aspect ratio. The output bounding box keeps its specified size. Any unfilled area of the bounding box is white.

aspectFill  
The image scales to fill in the bounding box using fixed aspect ratio. Portions of the image may be clipped.
