# organizer

Creates a generic element with its contained elements arranged through TVML styles.

## Overview

The `organizer` element provides the ability to manually arrange its containing elements. The `organizer` element creates a view where the elements it contains are arranged using the `tv-align` and `tv-position` styles. Containing elements are centered by default.

Elements contained in the same position are arranged from the top of the cell to the bottom, in the same order in which they are specified in the `organizer` element. You can specify a `` that displays a background image inside of the `organizer`. The background image is top-aligned and is fitted to the size of the `organizer` while keeping the imageâ€™s original aspect ratio. Text wrapping inside of the `organizer` only occurs in the `header`, `center`, and `footer` positions.
