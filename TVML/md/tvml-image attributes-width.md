# width

Specifies the maximum width for an image element.

## Overview

The image is shrunk to fit the bounding box if the image is bigger than the size specified for the `width` attribute. You must declare either a `width` style or attribute for an image. Declaring a style overwrites an attribute declaration. Hereâ€™s an example that sets the width for an image to 200 points.
