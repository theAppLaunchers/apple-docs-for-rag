# text-align

Aligns text horizontally in an element.

## Overview

Use the `text-align` style to specify how the text should be horizontally aligned in an element.

Hereâ€™s an example that horizontally centers the text in a title element:

```
This text is horizontally centered.
```

### Values

`left`  
The text aligns along the left edge of the containing element.

`right`  
The text aligns along the right edge of the containing element.

`center`  
The text aligns with the center of the containing element.

`justified`  
The text is justified in the containing element.

`natural`  
The text aligns based on the default alignment associated with the current localization of the app. The default for left-to-right scripts is left-alignment along the left edge of the containing element. The default alignment for right-to-left scripts is right-alignment along the right edge of the containing element.
