# monogramLockup

Creates a monogram using a person’s image or initials.

## Overview

The `monogramLockup` element creates a white circle that contains the image or initials of the person identified in the title. Use the `src` element to place an image inside of the circle. If no image is added, initials are centered in the circle, based on the `firstName` and `lastName` attributes in the `monogram` element. Here’s an example of a monogramLockup displaying an actor’s infomation.

```
