## Discussion

For example, if your app calls startMonitoring(_:during:events:) at 1:30pm with a schedule of 1:00pm to 2:00pm, then this boolean determines whether any activity between 1:00pm and 1:30pm will contribute to its threshold. If set to `true` and the event’s schedule does not start on a round hour (for example, it starts at 1:15pm instead of 1:00pm), the system will include device activity from the start of the nearest round hour (for example, it will still include usage from 1:00pm to 1:15pm).
