``` source
static func != (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`lhs`  

A value to compare.

`rhs`  

Another value to compare.

## Discussion

Inequality is the inverse of equality. For any values a and b, a != b implies that a == b is false. This is the default implementation of the not-equal-to operator (!=) for any type that conforms to Equatable.
