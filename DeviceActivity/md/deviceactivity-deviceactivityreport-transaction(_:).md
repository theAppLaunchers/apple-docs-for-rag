func transaction(_ transform: @escaping (inout Transaction) -> Void) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`transform`  

The transformation to apply to transactions within this view.

## Return Value

A view that wraps this view and applies a transformation to all transactions used within the view.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to change or replace the animation used in a view. Consider three identical animations controlled by a button that executes all three animations simultaneously:

- The first animation rotates the “Rotation” `Text` view by 360 degrees.

- The second uses the `transaction(_:)` modifier to change the animation by adding a delay to the start of the animation by two seconds and then increases the rotational speed of the “Rotation\nModified” `Text` view animation by a factor of 2.

- The third animation uses the `transaction(_:)` modifier to replace the rotation animation affecting the “Animation\nReplaced” `Text` view with a spring animation.

The following code implements these animations:

```
struct TransactionExample: View {
    @State private var flag = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 50) {
            HStack(spacing: 30) {
                Text("Rotation")
                    .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees:
                                            self.flag ? 360 : 0))

                Text("Rotation\nModified")
                    .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees:
                                            self.flag ? 360 : 0))
                    .transaction { view in
                        view.animation =
                            view.animation?.delay(2.0).speed(2)
                    }

                Text("Animation\nReplaced")
                    .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees:
                                            self.flag ? 360 : 0))
                    .transaction { view in
                        view.animation = .interactiveSpring(
                            response: 0.60,
                            dampingFraction: 0.20,
                            blendDuration: 0.25)
                    }
            }

            Button("Animate") {
                withAnimation(.easeIn(duration: 2.0)) {
                    self.flag.toggle()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Use this modifier on leaf views such as `Image` or `Button` rather than container views such as `VStack` or `HStack`. The transformation applies to all child views within this view; calling `transaction(_:)` on a container view can lead to unbounded scope of execution depending on the depth of the view hierarchy.
