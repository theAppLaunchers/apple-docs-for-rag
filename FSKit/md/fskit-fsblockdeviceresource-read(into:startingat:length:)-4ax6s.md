Instance Method

# read(into:startingAt:length:)

Synchronously reads data from the resource into a buffer.

macOS 15.4+

``` source
func read(
    into buffer: UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer,
    startingAt offset: off_t,
    length: Int
) throws -> Int
```

## Parameters 

`buffer`  

A buffer to receive the data.

`offset`  

The offset into the resource from which to start reading.

`length`  

A maximum number of bytes to read. The methodâ€™s return value contains the actual number of bytes read.

## Return Value

The actual number of bytes read.

## Discussion

This is a synchronous version of read(into:startingAt:length:).

In some cases, this method performs a partial read. In this case, the return value is shorter than the requested length.

Throws

An error describing any read error. This value is `EFAULT` if `buffer` is `NULL`, or `errno` if reading from the resource failed.
