Enumeration

# FSSyncFlags

Behavior flags for use with synchronization calls.

macOS 15.4+

``` source
enum FSSyncFlags
```

## Overview

These values are based on flags defined in `mount.h`. Since there are system-defined flags that are valid in the kernel but not in FSKit, this type defines its members as options rather than use an enumeration.

## Topics

A flag for synchronized I/O with file-integrity completion.

case noWait

A flag for synchronized I/O that starts I/O but doesnâ€™t wait for it.

case dWait

A flag for synchronized I/O with data-integrity completion.
