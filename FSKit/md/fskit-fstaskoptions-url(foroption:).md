## Discussion

Some command-line options refer to paths that indicate a location in which the module needs access to a file outside of its container. FSKit passes these paths as a URL tagged by the option name.

For example, `"-B" "./someFile"` returns the URL for `./someFile` when passed an option `"B"`. To indicate that your module treats a given option as a path, include it in the `pathOptions` dictionary within a command options dictionary (`FSActivatOptionSyntax`, `FSCheckOptionSyntax`, or `FSFormatOptionSyntax`). This dictionary uses the command option name as a key, and each entry has a value indicating what kind of entry to create.
