# FSVolume.PreallocateOperations

Methods and properties implemented by volumes that want to offer preallocation functions.

macOS 15.4+

``` source
protocol PreallocateOperations : NSObjectProtocol
```

## Overview

A preallocation operation allocates space for a file without writing to it yet. A file system may use reallocation to avoid performing space allocation while in the midst of I/O; this strategy improves performance. Also, if the expected I/O pattern is many small writes, preallocating contiguous chunks may prevent fragmenting the file system. This process can improve performance later.

In a kernel-based file system, you typically preallocate space with the `VNOP_ALLOCATE` operation, called from `fcntl(F_PREALLOCATE)`.

## Topics

### Preallocating space

func preallocateSpace(for: FSItem, at: off_t, length: Int, flags: FSVolume.PreallocateFlags, replyHandler: (Int, (any Error)?) -> Void)

Prealocates disk space for the given item.

**Required**

struct PreallocateFlags

Behavior flags for preallocation operations.

### Inspecting volume properties

var isPreallocateInhibited: Bool

A Boolean value that instructs FSKit not to call this protocolâ€™s methods, even if the volume conforms to it.
