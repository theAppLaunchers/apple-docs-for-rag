Case

# FSContainerState.blocked

The container is blocked from transitioning from the not-ready state to the ready state by a potentially-recoverable error.

macOS 15.4+

``` source
case blocked
```

## Discussion

This state implies that the error has a resolution that would allow the container to become ready, such as correcting an incorrect password.
