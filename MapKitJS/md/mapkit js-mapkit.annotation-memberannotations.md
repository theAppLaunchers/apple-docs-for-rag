# memberAnnotations

An array of annotations that the framework groups together in a cluster.

``` source
attribute mapkit.Annotation[] memberAnnotations;
```

## Mentioned in 

Clustering annotations

## Discussion

The memberAnnotations array contains all of the annotations that MapKit JS groups together in a cluster. This is a flat array. If there are multiple clusters of annotations, this array contains all of the individual annotations within those clusters; it doesnâ€™t contain any cluster annotations.
