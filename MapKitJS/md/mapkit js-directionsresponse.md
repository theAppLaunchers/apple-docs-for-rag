## Overview

To get directions, create an instance of mapkit.Directions and call the route method.

When your code calls the route function, MapKit JS returns a `DirectionsResponse` asynchronously via a callback function. MapKit JS invokes the callback function with two arguments, `error` and `data` on failure and success. The `data` parameter is a `DirectionsResponse` object, and the `error` parameter contains an error code and text description of the error.
