# mapkit.Search

An object that retrieves map-based search results for a user-entered query.

MapKit JS 5.0+

``` source
interface mapkit.Search
```

## Overview

The search service allows developers to populate a map with results from a user-entered query, including information about businesses and other points of interest. MapKit JS provides this functionality through a search object that makes network requests to the search service.

Supplying *search context* creates the most relevant results for a query. Context may include the userâ€™s location, or a coordinate or region that the developer provides.

To use the search service, create an instance of a search object with the desired options. Use the search object to make search requests.
