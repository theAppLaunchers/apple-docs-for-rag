# mapkit.FeatureVisibility

Constants indicating the visibility of different adaptive map features.

MapKit JS 5.0+

``` source
interface mapkit.FeatureVisibility {
 const string Adaptive;
 const string Hidden;
 const string Visible;
};
```

## Overview

Indicates whether the map shows adaptive features like the scale, compass, and annotation title and subtitle text. The display of an adaptive feature depends on the current map state. You can show or hide controls that arenâ€™t adaptive, such as the map type control or zoom controls, by setting map properties to `true` or `false`, respectively.

The following example shows the compass only when the map rotation is changing, and hides the zoom controls:

```
// Create a map.
var map = new mapkit.Map("my-map-element-id");

// Show the compass only when the rotation is actively changing.
map.showsCompass = mapkit.FeatureVisibility.Adaptive;

// Hide the zoom controls.
map.showsZoomControl = false;
```
