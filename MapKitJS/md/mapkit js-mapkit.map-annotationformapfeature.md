Instance Method

# annotationForMapFeature

The method MapKit JS calls when the framework creates a map feature annotation.

MapKit JS 5.74+

``` source
void annotationForMapFeature(
 mapkit.MapFeatureAnnotation mapFeatureAnnotation
);
```

## Discussion

You can choose to return the annotation the method provides with modified properties, or provide a new annotation to represent the map feature. If an annotation doesnâ€™t return, MapKit JS uses the default annotation.
