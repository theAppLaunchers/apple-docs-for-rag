## Discussion

This property accepts either a color name, such as `“rebeccapurple”`, or a hexadecimal color value, such as `“#663399”` (here, the equivalent of the named color). For more information about standardized colors, see the CSS working group’s list of common color names and values. The default value is `"#ff5b40”` (a shade of red).
