# DirectionsRequest

The requested start and end points for a route, as well as the planned mode of transportation.

MapKit JS 5.0+

``` source
dictionary DirectionsRequest {
 string|mapkit.Coordinate|Place origin;
 string|mapkit.Coordinate|Place destination;
 mapkit.Directions.Transport? transportType;
 boolean? requestsAlternateRoutes;
 Date? arrivalDate;
 Date? departureDate;
 boolean? avoidTolls;
};
```

## Overview

Provide a `DirectionsRequest` object to the route method to get directions between two points, as shown in the code listing that follows. Direction requests require origin and destination.

```
var myDirections = new mapkit.Directions();
myDirections.route({ 
  origin: "San Francisco, CA", 
  destination: "Oakland, CA", 
  transportType: mapkit.Directions.Transport.Automobile }, 
  function(error, data) { 
    // Results return asynchronously via this callback function, in `data`
  } 
);
```
