# Route

Information about a route, including step-by-step instructions, distance, and estimated travel time.

MapKit JS 5.0+

``` source
dictionary Route {
 mapkit.PolylineOverlay polyline;
 mapkit.Coordinate[][] path;
 RouteStep[] steps;
 string name;
 number distance;
 number expectedTravelTime;
 mapkit.Directions.Transport transportType;
 boolean? hasTolls;
};
```

## Overview

A Route object encapsulates the complete information for a route that the server returns, including geometry that you can use to draw a path and step-by-step text instructions. You donâ€™t instantiate Route objects directly; MapKit JS returns them as part of the DirectionsResponse.
