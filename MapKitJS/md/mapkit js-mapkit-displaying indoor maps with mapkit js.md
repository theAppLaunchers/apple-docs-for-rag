## Overview

This sample uses the importGeoJSON method from MapKit JS to import data in Indoor Mapping Data Format (IMDF), and render an indoor map in your browser. The sample app demonstrates decoding, rendering, and styling of a small subset of the IMDF feature types and properties.

Use these examples to create your own indoor map with a style that is consistent with your appâ€™s design. You can handle feature categories specific to your venue, and configure the map style using your own colors, icons, and level picker.
