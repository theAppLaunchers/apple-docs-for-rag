Enumeration Case

# Adaptive

A constant indicating that feature visibility adapts to the current map state.

MapKit JS 5.0+

``` source
const string Adaptive;
```

## Discussion

Use `mapkit.FeatureVisibility.Adaptive` to show adaptive controls only when the map is in a given state. You can show or hide controls that arenâ€™t adaptive by setting map properties to `true` or `false`, respectively.

The following example sets the adaptive visibility for the compass and scale, and hides the map type and zoom controls:

```
// Create a map.
var map = new mapkit.Map("my-map-element-id");

// Show the compass only when the rotation is actively changing.
map.showsCompass = mapkit.FeatureVisibility.Adaptive;

// Show the scale only when the zoom level is actively changing.
map.showsScale = mapkit.FeatureVisibility.Adaptive;

// Hide the map type and zoom controls.
map.showsMapTypeControl = false;
map.showsZoomControl = false;
```
