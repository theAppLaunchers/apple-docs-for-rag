``` source
func CFHostGetReachability(
    _ theHost: CFHost,
    _ hasBeenResolved: UnsafeMutablePointer?
) -> Unmanaged?
```

Deprecated

Use Network framework instead, see deprecation notice in \

## Parameters 

`theHost`  

The host whose reachability is to be obtained. The host must have been previously resolved. (To resolve a host, call CFHostStartInfoResolution(_:_:_:).) This value must not be `NULL`.

`hasBeenResolved`  

On return, contains `TRUE` if the reachability was available, otherwise `FALSE`. This value may be `NULL`.

## Return Value

A CFData object that wraps the reachability flags (`SCNetworkConnectionFlags`) defined in `SystemConfiguration/SCNetwork.h`, or `NULL` if reachability information was not available.

## Discussion

This function gets reachability information in a thread-safe way, but the resulting data is not thread-safe. The data is returned as a “get” as opposed to a copy, so the data is not safe if the CFHost is altered from another thread.
