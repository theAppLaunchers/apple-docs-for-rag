## Parameters 

`theService`  

The CFNetService to resolve; cannot be `NULL`. The resolution will fail if the service doesn’t have a domain, a type, and a name.

`timeout`  

Value of type `CFTimeInterval` specifying the maximum amount of time allowed to perform the resolution. If the resolution is not performed within the specified amount of time, a timeout error will be returned. If `timeout` is less than or equal to zero, an infinite amount of time is allowed.

`error`  

Pointer to a CFStreamError structure that will be set to an error code and the error code’s domain if an error occurs; or `NULL` if you don’t want to receive the error code and its domain.

## Return Value

`TRUE` if an asynchronous service resolution was started or if a synchronous service resolution updated the CFNetService; `FALSE` if an asynchronous or synchronous resolution failed or timed out, or if a synchronous resolution was canceled.

## Discussion

This function updates the specified CFNetService with the IP address or addresses associated with the service. Call CFNetServiceGetAddressing(_:) to get the addresses.

When resolving a service that runs in asynchronous mode, this function returns `TRUE` if the CFNetService has a domain, type, and name, and the underlying resolution process was started. Otherwise, this function returns `FALSE`. Once started, the resolution continues until it is canceled by calling CFNetServiceCancel(_:).

When resolving a service that runs in synchronous mode, this function blocks until the CFNetService is updated with at least one IP address, until an error occurs, or until CFNetServiceCancel(_:) is called.

### Special Considerations

This function is thread safe.

If the service will be used in asynchronous mode, you must call CFNetServiceSetClient(_:_:_:) before calling this function.
