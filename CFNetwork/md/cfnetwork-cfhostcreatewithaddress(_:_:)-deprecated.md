func CFHostCreateWithAddress(
    _ allocator: CFAllocator?,
    _ addr: CFData
) -> Unmanaged
```

Deprecated

Use Network framework instead, see deprecation notice in \

## Parameters 

`addr`  

A CFDataRef object containing a `sockaddr` structure for the address of the host. This value must not be `NULL`.

## Return Value

A valid CFHostRef object that can be resolved, or `NULL` if the host could not be created. Ownership follows the The Create Rule.

## Discussion

Call CFHostStartInfoResolution(_:_:_:) to resolve the return object’s name and reachability information.

### Special Considerations

This function is thread safe.
