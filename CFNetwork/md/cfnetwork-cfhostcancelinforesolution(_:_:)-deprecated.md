## Parameters 

`theHost`  

The host for which a resolution is to be cancelled. This value must not be `NULL`.

`info`  

A value of type `CFHostInfoType` specifying the type of resolution that is to be cancelled. See CFHostInfoType for possible values.

## Discussion

This function cancels the asynchronous or synchronous resolution specified by `info` for the host specified by `theHost`.

This function is thread safe.
