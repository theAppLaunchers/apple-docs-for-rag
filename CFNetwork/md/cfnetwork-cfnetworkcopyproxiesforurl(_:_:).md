``` source
func CFNetworkCopyProxiesForURL(
    _ url: CFURL,
    _ proxySettings: CFDictionary
) -> Unmanaged
```

## Parameters 

`url`  

The URL your application intends to access.

`proxySettings`  

A dictionary describing the available proxy settings. The dictionary should be in the format returned by `SystemConfiguration.framework`. (See kCFStreamErrorDomainSystemConfiguration for more information.)

## Return Value

Returns an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary describes a single proxy. The array is ordered optimally for requesting the URL specified.

## Discussion

In general, you should try to download a URL using the first proxy in the array, try the second proxy if the first one fails, and so on.

Every proxy dictionary has an entry for `kCFProxyTypeKey`. If the type is anything except `kCFProxyTypeAutoConfigurationURL`, the dictionary also has entries for the proxyâ€™s host and port (under `kCFProxyHostNameKey` and `kCFProxyPortNumberKey` respectively). If the type is `kCFProxyTypeAutoConfigurationURL`, it has an entry for `kCFProxyAutoConfigurationURLKey`.

The keys for username and password are optional and are present only if the username or password could be extracted from the information passed in (either from the URL itself or from the proxy dictionary supplied). These APIs do not consult any external credential stores such as the Keychain.
