# HMAccessoryOwnershipToken

Authentication data that your app provides when adding an accessory to a home.

iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
class HMAccessoryOwnershipToken
```

## Overview

If you manufacture an accessory that requires user authentication to add the accessory to a home, manage the authentication in your app and produce a token that represents the successful outcome of that process. Wrap the token data in an HMAccessoryOwnershipToken instance and call the init(url:ownershipToken:) method to create an authenticated HMAccessorySetupPayload instance. Then call the addAndSetupAccessories(with:completionHandler:) method with the payload.

If the user attempts from the Home app to add an accessory that requires a token, the Home app calls the associated appâ€™s homeManager(_:didReceiveAddAccessoryRequest:) home manager delegate method to perform the negotiation and provide the token.
