## Discussion

Test a characteristicâ€™s properties array for any of the constants listed in Characteristic Properties to learn something about the corresponding characteristic. For example, you can create a readability Boolean in an extension to the HMCharacteristic class by testing for HMCharacteristicPropertyReadable:

```
extension HMCharacteristic {
    var isReadable: Bool {
        return properties.contains(HMCharacteristicPropertyReadable)
    }
}
```
