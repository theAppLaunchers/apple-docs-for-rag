``` source
init?(data: Data)
```

## Parameters 

`data`  

Data to be sent to the accessory to prove ownership.

Obtain token data by negotiating with an accessory outside of HomeKit. You typically obtain token data for an accessory that you manufacture.

Token creation can fail if the data doesnâ€™t represent a valid ownership token.
