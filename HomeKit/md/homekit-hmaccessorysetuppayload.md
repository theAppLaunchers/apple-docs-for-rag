# HMAccessorySetupPayload

A payload for authenticating a HomeKit accessory.

iOS 11.3+iPadOS 11.3+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
class HMAccessorySetupPayload
```

## Overview

The setup payload provides a URL to authenticate an accessory. Typically, the URL comes from scanning a QR code on the accessory. Use a setup payload to authenticate devices that are already deployed, for which scanning a QR code would be difficult, or if you need to provide an optional ownership token that you negotiate with the accessory outside of HomeKit.
