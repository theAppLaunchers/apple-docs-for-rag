## Discussion

Because different things can be plugged into outlets or controlled by switches, there is a tight association between a switch or outlet service and another service that it controlsâ€”for example, a lamp plugged into an outlet associates a lightbulb service with the outlet, even if the lamp itself is not a supported HomeKit accessory.

The associated service can be any service defined by the HomeKit Accessory Profile that supports HMCharacteristicTypePowerState, other than HMServiceTypeOutlet or HMServiceTypeSwitch.

See Accessory Service Types for a list of service types.
