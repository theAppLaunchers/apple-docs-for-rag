# duration

The length of the media resource in seconds. (read-only)

Safari Desktop 10.0+Safari Mobile 10.0+

``` source
readonly attribute unrestricted double duration;
```

## Discussion

This property is `0` if there is no media data available. This property is `NaN` if the duration is unknown. The value is positive infinity if the duration is known but is indefiniteâ€”for example, a live stream.
