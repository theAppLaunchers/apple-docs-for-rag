Instance Property

# acceleration

The acceleration that the user is giving to the device.

Safari Mobile 4.2+

``` source
readonly attribute Acceleration acceleration;
```

## Discussion

The acceleration data are expressed in m/s^2 and use the following `x`, `y`, and `z` axis properties represented as doubles:

x  
In the plane of the screen, positive towards the right side of the screen.

y  
In the plane of the screen, positive towards the top of the screen.

z  
Perpendicular to the screen, positive out of the screen.

This property is `null` if the device cannot provide the user accelerationâ€”that is, if the device does not have a gyroscope.

Use the accelerationIncludingGravity property to get the total acceleration.

Note

If the device does not have a gyroscope, then you may need to implement your own gravity direction detection using a low pass filter.
