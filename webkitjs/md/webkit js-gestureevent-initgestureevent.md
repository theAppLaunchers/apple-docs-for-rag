Safari Desktop 10.1+Safari Mobile 2.0+

``` source
void initGestureEvent(
    DOMString type, 
    boolean canBubble, 
    boolean cancelable, 
    DOMWindow? view, 
    long detail, 
    long screenX, 
    long screenY, 
    long clientX, 
    long clientY, 
    boolean ctrlKey, 
    boolean altKey, 
    boolean shiftKey, 
    boolean metaKey, 
    EventTarget? target, 
    float scale, 
    float rotation
);
```

## Parameters 

`type`  

The type of event that occurred.

`canBubble`  

Indicates whether an event can bubble. If `true`, the event can bubble; otherwise, it cannot.

`cancelable`  

Indicates whether an event can have its default action prevented. If `true`, the default action can be prevented; otherwise, it cannot.

`view`  

The view (DOM window) where the event occurred.

`detail`  

Specifies some detail information about the event depending on the type of event.

`screenX`  

The x-coordinate of the event’s location in screen coordinates.

`screenY`  

The y-coordinate of the event’s location in screen coordinates.

`clientX`  

The x-coordinate of the event’s location relative to the window's viewport.

`clientY`  

The y-coordinate of the event’s location relative to the window's viewport.

`ctrlKey`  

If `true`, the control key is pressed; otherwise, it is not.

`altKey`  

If `true`, the alt key is pressed; otherwise, it is not.

`shiftKey`  

If `true`, the Shift key is pressed; otherwise, it is not.

`metaKey`  

If `true`, the meta key is pressed; otherwise, it is not.

`target`  

The target of this gesture.

`scale`  

The distance between two fingers since the start of an event as a multiplier of the initial distance. The initial value is `1.0`. If less than `1.0`, the gesture is pinch close (to zoom out). If greater than `1.0`, the gesture is pinch open (to zoom in).

`rotation`  

The delta rotation since the start of an event, in degrees, where clockwise is positive and counter-clockwise is negative. The initial value is `0.0`.

## Discussion

Use this method to programmatically create a `GestureEvent` object.
