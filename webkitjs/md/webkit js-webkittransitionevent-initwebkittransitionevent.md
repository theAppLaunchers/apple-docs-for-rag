# initWebKitTransitionEvent

Initializes a new transition event object.

``` source
void initWebKitTransitionEvent (in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMString propertyNameArg, in double elapsedTimeArg);
```

## Parameters 

`typeArg`  

The type of event.

Possible values for this argument are described in `Types of Transition Events`. This type of event can bubble and be canceled. Its `propertyName` property is always set.

`canBubbleArg`  

Determines whether the event can bubble. Pass `true` if it can bubble; otherwise, `false`.

`cancelableArg`  

Determines whether the eventâ€™s default action can be prevented. Pass `true` if it can be prevented; otherwise, `false`.

`propertyNameArg`  

The name of the CSS property associated with this event.

`elapsedTimeArg`  

The duration of the transition, in seconds, since the event was sent.

## Overview

You use this method to initialize the value of a `WebKitTransitionEvent` object that is created through the `DocumentEvent` interface. This method can only be invoked before the `WebKitTransitionEvent` object is dispatched via the `dispatchEvent` method (although, it can be invoked multiple times during that phase, if necessary). If it is invoked multiple times, the final invocation takes precedence.
