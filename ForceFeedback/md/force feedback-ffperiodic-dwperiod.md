### Instance Properties

var dwMagnitude: DWORD

Magnitude of the effect, in the range from 0 through 10,000. If an envelope is applied to this effect, the value represents the magnitude of the sustain. If no envelope is applied, the value represents the amplitude of the entire effect.

var dwPhase: DWORD

Position in the cycle of the periodic effect at which playback begins, in the range from 0 through 35,999.

var lOffset: LONG

Offset of the effect. The range of forces generated by the effect is **lOffset** minus **dwMagnitude** to **lOffset** plus **dwMagnitude**. The value of the **lOffset** member is also the baseline for any envelope that is applied to the effect.
