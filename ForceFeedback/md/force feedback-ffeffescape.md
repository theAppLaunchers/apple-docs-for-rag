Structure

# FFEFFESCAPE

The FFEFFESCAPE structure passes hardware-specific data directly to the Force Feedback plugIn.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.2+

``` source
struct FFEFFESCAPE
```

## Topics

### Initializers

init()

init(dwSize: DWORD, dwCommand: DWORD, lpvInBuffer: UnsafeMutableRawPointer!, cbInBuffer: DWORD, lpvOutBuffer: UnsafeMutableRawPointer!, cbOutBuffer: DWORD)

### Instance Properties

var cbInBuffer: DWORD

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the **lpvInBuffer** buffer.

var cbOutBuffer: DWORD

On entry, specifies the size, in bytes, of the **lpvOutBuffer** buffer. On exit, specifies the number of bytes actually produced by the command.

var dwCommand: DWORD

Specifies a plugIn specific command number. Contact the hardware vendor for a list of valid commands and their parameters.

var dwSize: DWORD

Size, in bytes, of this structure. This member must be initialized before the structure is used.

var lpvInBuffer: UnsafeMutableRawPointer!

Buffer containing the data required to perform the operation.

var lpvOutBuffer: UnsafeMutableRawPointer!

Buffer in which the operationâ€™s output data is returned.
