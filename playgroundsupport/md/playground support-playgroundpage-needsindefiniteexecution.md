## Discussion

By default, all top-level code is executed, and then execution is terminated. When working with asynchronous code, enable indefinite execution to allow execution to continue after the end of the playgroundâ€™s top-level code is reached. This, in turn, gives threads and callbacks time to execute.

With a traditional live view, editing the playground automatically stops execution, even when indefinite execution is enabled. When using the always-on live view, execution continues whether or not indefinite execution is enabled.

Set `needsIndefiniteExecution` to `true` to continue execution after the end of top-level code. Set it to `false` to stop execution at that point.

The default value is `false`. It's set to true when liveView is set to a non-`nil` value.
