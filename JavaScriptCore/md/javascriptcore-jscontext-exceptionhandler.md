``` source
var exceptionHandler: ((JSContext?, JSValue?) -> Void)! { get set }
```

## Discussion

The block takes the following parameters:

context  
The context in which the exception originates.

exception  
The JavaScript exception thrown.

The default value exception handler block stores its `exception` parameter value into the contextâ€™s exception property. As a consequence, the default behavior is that unhandled exceptions occurring within a callback from JavaScript to native code are thrown again upon return. Setting this value to `nil` results in all uncaught exceptions being silently consumed.
