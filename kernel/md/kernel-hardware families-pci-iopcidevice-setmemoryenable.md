# setMemoryEnable

Sets the device's memory space response.

``` source
virtual bool setMemoryEnable(
 boolenable ); 
```

## Parameters 

`enable`  

True or false to enable or disable the memory space response.

## Return Value

True if the memory space response was previously enabled, false otherwise.

## Overview

This method sets the memory space response bit in the device's command config space register to the passed value, and returns the previous state of the enable.
