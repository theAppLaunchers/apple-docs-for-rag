# serviceMatching(const char \*, OSDictionary \*)

Creates a matching dictionary, or adds matching properties to an existing dictionary, that specify an IOService class match.

``` source
static OSDictionary * serviceMatching(
 const char *className, 
 OSDictionary *table = 0 ); 
```

## Parameters 

`className`  

The class name, as a const C string. Class matching is successful on IOService objects of this class or any subclass.

`table`  

If zero, `serviceMatching` creates a matching dictionary and returns a reference to it, otherwise the matching properties are added to the specified dictionary.

## Return Value

The matching dictionary created, or passed in, is returned on success, or zero on failure.

## Overview

A very common matching criteria for IOService object is based on its class. `serviceMatching` creates a matching dictionary that specifies any IOService object of a class, or its subclasses. The class is specified by name, and an existing dictionary may be passed in, in which case the matching properties will be added to that dictionary rather than creating a new one.
