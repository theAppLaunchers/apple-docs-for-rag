Enumeration Case

# kUSBInformationRootHubisBuiltIn

The USB root hub is built-in.

macOS 10.6+

``` source
kUSBInformationRootHubisBuiltIn = 10
```

## Discussion

If this is a root hub simulation and it’s built in to the enclosure, this bit is set. If it’s on an expansion card, this bit is clear.
