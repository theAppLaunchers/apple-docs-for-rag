Enumeration Case

# kUSBPowerDuringWakeRevocable

The system requests power reallocation as revocable.

macOS 10.8+

``` source
kUSBPowerDuringWakeRevocable = 6
```

## Discussion

The system uses this extra power while itâ€™s awake, but the kUSBPowerRequestWakeRelease message can take that power away and reallocate it to another device.
