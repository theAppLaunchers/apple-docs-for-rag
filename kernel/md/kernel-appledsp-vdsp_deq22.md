Function

# vDSP_deq22

Performs two-pole, two-zero recursive filtering on a single-precision vector.

macOS 10.4+

``` source
void vDSP_deq22(const float *__A, vDSP_Stride __IA, const float *__B, float *__C, vDSP_Stride __IC, vDSP_Length __N);
```

## Parameters 

`__A`  

The single-precision real input vector.

`__IA`  

The stride for input vector `A`.

`__B`  

Five single-precision input filter coefficients, with a stride of one.

`__C`  

The single-precision real output vector.

`__IC`  

The stride for output vector `C`.

`__N`  

The number of new output elements to produce.

## Discussion

This function creates `N` new values in output vector `C`, beginning at the third element. The function performs two-pole, two-zero recursive filtering on input vector `A`, which must contain at least `N` + 2 values; `C` must also contain at least `N` + 2 values. Since the computation is recursive, prior to calling this function, initialize the first two elements in `C`.

You can only implement this function out of place â€” that is, the input and output memory must not overlap.

This function performs the following operation:

or (n = 2; n &lt; N+2; ++n) 
    C[n] =
        + A[n-0]*B[0]
        + A[n-1]*B[1]
        + A[n-2]*B[2]
        - C[n-1]*B[3]
        - C[n-2]*B[4];
