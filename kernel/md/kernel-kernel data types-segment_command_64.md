cmdsize

fileoff

filesize

Indicates the number of bytes occupied by this segment on disk. For segments that require more memory at runtime than they do at build time, `vmsize` can be larger than `filesize`. For example, the `__PAGEZERO` segment generated by the linker for `MH_EXECUTABLE` files has a `vmsize` of 0x1000 but a `filesize` of 0. Because `__PAGEZERO` contains no data, there is no need for it to occupy any space until runtime. Also, the static linker often allocates uninitialized data at the end of the `__DATA` segment; in this case, the `vmsize` is larger than the `filesize`. The loader guarantees that any memory of this sort is initialized with zeros.

flags

initprot

maxprot

nsects

Indicates the number of section data structures following this load command.

segname

vmaddr

vmsize

Indicates the number of bytes of virtual memory occupied by this segment. See also the description of `filesize`, below.
