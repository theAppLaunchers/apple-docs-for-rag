# IOMemoryDescriptor

An abstract base class that defines common methods for describing physical or virtual memory.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
class IOMemoryDescriptor : OSObject
```

## Overview

An `IOMemoryDescriptor` object represents a buffer or range of memory, specified as one or more physical or virtual address ranges. It contains methods to return the memory's physically contiguous segments (fragments), for use with the IOMemoryCursor, and methods to map the memory into any address space with caching and placed mapping options.

## Topics

### Creating the Memory Buffer

initWithOptions

Primary initializer for all variants of memory descriptors.

withAddress

Creates an IOMemoryDescriptor to describe one virtual range of the kernel task.

+ withAddress

Creates an IOMemoryDescriptor to describe one virtual range of the kernel task.

withAddressRange

Creates an IOMemoryDescriptor to describe one virtual range of the specified map.

+ withAddressRange

withPersistentMemoryDescriptor

Copy constructor that generates a new memory descriptor if the backing memory for the same task's virtual address and length has changed.

+ withPersistentMemoryDescriptor

Copy constructor that generates a new memory descriptor if the backing memory for the same task's virtual address and length has changed.

withPhysicalAddress
