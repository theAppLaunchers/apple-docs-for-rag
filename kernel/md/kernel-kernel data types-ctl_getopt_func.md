# ctl_getopt_func

macOS 10.13+

``` source
typedef errno_t (*ctl_getopt_func)(kern_ctl_ref kctlref, u_int32_t unit, void *unitinfo, int opt, void *data, size_t *len);
```

## Parameters 

`kctlref`  

The control ref of the kernel control.

`unit`  

The unit number of the kernel control instance.

`unitinfo`  

The user-defined private data initialized by the ctl_connect_func callback.

`opt`  

The socket option.

`data`  

A buffer to copy the results in to. May be NULL, see discussion.

`len`  

A pointer to the length of the buffer. This should be set to the length of the buffer used before returning.

## Discussion

The ctl_getopt_func is used to handle client get socket option requests for the SYSPROTO_CONTROL option level. A buffer is allocated for storage and passed to your function. The length of that buffer is also passed. Upon return, you should set \*len to length of the buffer used. In some cases, data may be NULL. When this happens, \*len should be set to the length you would have returned had data not been NULL. If the buffer is too small, return an error.
