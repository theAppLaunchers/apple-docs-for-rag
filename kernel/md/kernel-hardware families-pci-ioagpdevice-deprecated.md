# IOAGPDevice

An IOService class representing an AGP primary device.

macOS 10.0â€“11.0Deprecated

``` source
class IOAGPDevice : IOPCIDevice
```

## Overview

The discovery of an AGP primary device by the PCI bus family results in an instance of the IOAGPDevice being created and published. It provides services specific to AGP, in addition to the PCI services supplied by its superclass IOPCIDevice.

## Topics

### Miscellaneous

commitAGPMemory

Makes memory addressable by AGP transactions.

createAGPSpace

Allocates the AGP space, and enables AGP transactions on the primary and secondary.

destroyAGPSpace

Destroys the AGP space, and disables AGP transactions on the primary and secondary.

getAGPRangeAllocator

Accessor to obtain the AGP range allocator.

getAGPSpace

Returns the allocated AGP space.

getAGPStatus

Returns the current state of the AGP bus.

releaseAGPMemory

Releases memory addressable by AGP transactions.
