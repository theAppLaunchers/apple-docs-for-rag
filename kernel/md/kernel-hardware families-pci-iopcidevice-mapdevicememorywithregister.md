# mapDeviceMemoryWithRegister

Maps a physical range of the device.

``` source
virtual IOMemoryMap * mapDeviceMemoryWithRegister(
 UInt8 reg, 
 IOOptionBits options = 0 ); 
```

## Parameters 

`reg`  

The 8-bit configuration space register that is the base address register for the desired range.

`options`  

Options to be passed to the IOMemoryDescriptor::map() method.

## Return Value

An instance of IOMemoryMap, or zero if the index is beyond the count available. The mapping should be released only when access to it is no longer required.

## Overview

This method will create a mapping for the IODeviceMemory for the physical memory range that was assigned to the configuration space base address register passed in, with IODeviceMemory::map(options). The mapping is represented by the returned instance of IOMemoryMap, which should not be released until the mapping is no longer required. This method is analogous to IOService::mapDeviceMemoryWithIndex.
