# USBNotificationTypes

Defines types of USB notifications.

macOS 10.9+

``` source
typedef enum USBNotificationTypes USBNotificationTypes;
```

## Discussion

Use this enumeration to register for USB notifications. You can OR these types together if you need more than one notification. Acknowledge each notification before the process (system sleep or system wake) continues. See RegisterForNotification and AcknowledgeNotification for more information.
