# output

Transfers all packets in the mbuf queue to the target.

``` source
virtual void output(
 IOMbufQueue *queue,
 UInt32 *state); 
```

## Parameters 

`queue`  

A queue of output packets.

`state`  

Returns a state bit defined by IOBasicOutputQueue that declares the new state of the queue following this method call. A kStateStalled is returned if the queue should stall, otherwise 0 is returned.
