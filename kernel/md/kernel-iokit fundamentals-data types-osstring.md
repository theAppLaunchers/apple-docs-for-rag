# OSString

OSString wraps a C string in a C++ object for use in Libkern collections.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
class OSString : OSObject
```

## Overview

OSString is a container class for managing arrays of characters. An OSString normally maintains its own character buffer and allows changes, but you can create an "immutable" OSString that references an external C string buffer using the "NoCopy" creator functions. Functions called to change the contents of an immutable OSString will fail.

**Encodings**

OSString makes no provisions for different character encodings and assumes that a string is a nul-terminated sequence of single-byte characters. User-space code must either assume an encoding (typically ASCII or UTF-8) or determine it in some other way (such as an IORegistryEntry property).

**Altering Strings**

OSString's intended use is as a reference-counted object container for a C string and little more. While OSString provides full access to the underlying C string, it provides little in the way of string object manipulation; there are no append or insert functions, only a set-character function. If you need to manipulate OSStrings, it's generally best to get the C strings, alter them as necessary, and create a new OSString object from the resulting C string.

**Use Restrictions**

With very few exceptions in the I/O Kit, all Libkern-based C++ classes, functions, and macros are **unsafe** to use in a primary interrupt context. Consult the I/O Kit documentation related to primary interrupts for more information.

OSString provides no concurrency protection; it's up to the usage context to provide any protection necessary. Some portions of the I/O Kit, such as IORegistryEntry, handle synchronization via defined member functions for setting properties.

## Topics

### Miscellaneous

free

Deallocates or releases any resources used by the OSString instance.

getChar

Returns the character at a given index in the string object.

getCStringNoCopy

Returns a pointer to the internal C string buffer.

getLength

Returns the number of characters in the OSString object.

initWithCString

Initializes an OSString from a C string.

initWithCStringNoCopy

Initializes an immutable OSString to share the provided C string buffer.

initWithString
