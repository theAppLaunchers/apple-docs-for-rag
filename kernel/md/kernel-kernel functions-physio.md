Function

# physio

Perform I/O on a device to/from target memory described by a uio.

macOS 10.4+

``` source
int physio(void (*f_strategy)(buf_t), buf_t bp, dev_t dev, int flags, u_int (*f_minphys)(buf_t), struct uio *uio, int blocksize);
```

## Parameters 

`f_strategy`  

Strategy routine to call to initiate I/O.

`bp`  

Buffer to configure and pass to strategy routine; can be NULL.

`dev`  

Device on which to perform I/O.

`flags`  

B_READ or B_WRITE.

`f_minphys`  

Function which calls buf_setcount() to set a byte count which is suitably small for the device in question. Returns byte count that has been set (or unchanged) on the buffer.

`uio`  

UIO describing the I/O operation.

`blocksize`  

Logical block size for this vnode.

## Return Value

0 for success; EFAULT for an invalid uio; errors from buf_biowait().

## Discussion

physio() allows I/O directly from a device to user-space memory. It waits for all I/O to complete before returning.
