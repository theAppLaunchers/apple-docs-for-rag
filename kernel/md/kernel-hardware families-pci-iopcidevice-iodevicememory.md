# ioDeviceMemory

Accessor to the I/O space aperture for the bus.

``` source
virtual IODeviceMemory * ioDeviceMemory(
 void ); 
```

## Return Value

A pointer to an IODeviceMemory object for the I/O aperture. The IODeviceMemory is retained by the provider, so is valid while attached, or while any mappings to it exist. It should not be released by the caller.

## Overview

This method will return a reference to the IODeviceMemory for the I/O aperture of the bus the device is on.
