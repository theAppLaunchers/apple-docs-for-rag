# Determining system capabilities

Interrogate the system for processor, cache, and topology information.

## Overview

Obtain information about parameters related to processor availability, cache size, and performance-level characteristics on the system by using the sysctlbyname function. These parameters provide details about your system that can aid in tuning performance. For example, you can obtain the count of the highest-performing processor cores to spawn a worker thread for each core. Or you can determine the size of the L2 cache and the number of processor cores that share it to perform software cache-blocking optimization.

### Determine processor characteristics

The system enables a processor core when itâ€™s powered on and available for thread scheduling. Each logical processor core executes a software thread that the operating system manages. On systems where the number of logical processor cores exceeds the number of physical processor cores, two or more logical processor cores share a physical core through simultaneous multithreading (SMT). The following parameters provide processor availability information about the system on chip (SoC):

`hw.activecpu`  
The number of enabled logical processor cores in the SoC. This is an alias of `hw.logicalcpu`.

`hw.ncpu`  
The number of logical processor cores in the SoC. This is an alias of `hw.logicalcpu_max`.

`hw.logicalcpu`  
The number of enabled logical processor cores in the SoC. This is an alias of `hw.activecpu`.

`hw.logicalcpu_max`  
The number of logical processor cores in the SoC. This is an alias of `hw.ncpu`.

`hw.physicalcpu`  
The number of enabled physical processor cores in the SoC.

`hw.physicalcpu_max`  
The number of physical processor cores in the SoC.

### Determine system topology

The following parameters provide processor core performance-level information. First, determine the number of types of processor cores with `hw.nperflevels`. Then, for each of the parameters, replace *N* with a number between `0` and the number of performance levels minus one. Lower values of *N* indicate higher-performance core types.

`hw.nperflevels`  
The number of types of general purpose processor cores in the SoC.

`hw.perflevel`*N*`.cpusperl2`  
For processor cores of performance level *N*, the number of cores that share an L2 cache.

`hw.perflevel`*N*`.cpusperl3`  
For processor cores of performance level *N*, the number of cores that share an L3 cache.

`hw.perflevel`*N*`.l1dcachesize`  
For processor cores of performance level *N*, the size in bytes of the L1 data cache.

`hw.perflevel`*N*`.l1icachesize`  
For processor cores of performance level *N*, the size in bytes of the L1 instruction cache.

`hw.perflevel`*N*`.l2cachesize`  
For processor cores of performance level *N*, the size in bytes of the L2 cache.

`hw.perflevel`*N*`.l3cachesize `  
For processor cores of performance level *N*, the size in bytes of the L3 cache.

`hw.perflevel`*N*`.logicalcpu`  
For processor cores of performance level *N*, the number of enabled logical cores in the SoC.

`hw.perflevel`*N*`.logicalcpu_max`  
For processor cores of performance level *N*, the number of logical cores in the SoC.

`hw.perflevel`*N*`.physicalcpu`  
For processor cores of performance level *N*, the number of enabled physical cores in the SoC.

`hw.perflevel`*N*`.physicalcpu_max`  
For processor cores of performance level *N*, the number of physical cores in the SoC.

Querying the following parameters is equivalent to querying the per-performance-level information for the least performant core. For example, `hw.l1dcachesize` is equivalent to `hw.perflevel[`*N*`].l1dcachesize`, where *N* is `hw.nperflevels` minus one.

`hw.l1dcachesize`  
The size in bytes of the L1 data cache.

`hw.l1icachesize`  
The size in bytes of the L1 instruction cache.

`hw.l2cachesize`  
The size in bytes of the L2 cache.

`hw.l3cachesize`  
The size in bytes of the L3 cache.

### Determine memory sizes

The following parameters provide cache line, memory, and page size information:

`hw.cachelinesize`  
The size in bytes of the system cache line.

`hw.memsize`  
The size in bytes of dynamic RAM.

`hw.pagesize`  
The size in bytes of a virtual memory page.
