# mbuf_attachcluster

macOS 10.4–10.15.4Deprecated

``` source
errno_t mbuf_attachcluster(mbuf_how_t how, mbuf_type_t type, mbuf_t *mbuf, caddr_t extbuf, void (*extfree)(caddr_t, u_int, caddr_t), size_t extsize, caddr_t extarg);
```

## Parameters 

`how`  

Blocking or non-blocking.

`type`  

The type of the mbuf if mbuf is non-NULL; otherwise ignored.

`mbuf`  

Pointer to the address of the mbuf; if NULL, an mbuf will be allocated, otherwise, it must point to a valid mbuf address. If the user-supplied mbuf is already attached to a cluster, the current cluster will be freed before the mbuf gets attached to the supplied external buffer. Note that this routine may return a different mbuf_t than the one you passed in.

`extbuf`  

Address of the external buffer.

`extfree`  

Free routine for the external buffer; the caller is required to defined a routine that will be invoked when the mbuf is freed.

`extsize`  

Size of the external buffer.

`extarg`  

Private value that will be passed to the free routine when it is called at the time the mbuf is freed.

## Return Value

0 on success EINVAL - Invalid parameter ENOMEM - Not enough memory available

## Discussion

Attach an external buffer as a cluster for an mbuf. If mbuf points to a NULL mbuf_t, an mbuf will be allocated for you. If mbuf points to a non-NULL mbuf_t, the user-supplied mbuf will be used instead. The caller is responsible for allocating the external buffer by calling mbuf_alloccluster().
