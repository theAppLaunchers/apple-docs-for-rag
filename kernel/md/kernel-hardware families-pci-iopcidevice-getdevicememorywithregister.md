# getDeviceMemoryWithRegister

Returns an instance of IODeviceMemory representing one of the device's memory mapped ranges.

``` source
virtual IODeviceMemory * getDeviceMemoryWithRegister(
 UInt8reg ); 
```

## Parameters 

`reg`  

The 8-bit configuration space register that is the base address register for the desired range.

## Return Value

A pointer to an instance of IODeviceMemory, or zero no such range was found. The IODeviceMemory is retained by the provider, so is valid while attached, or while any mappings to it exist. It should not be released by the caller.

## Overview

This method will return a pointer to an instance of IODeviceMemory for the physical memory range that was assigned to the configuration space base address register passed in. It is analogous to IOService::getDeviceMemoryWithIndex.
