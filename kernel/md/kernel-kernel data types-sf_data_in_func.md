macOS 10.4+

``` source
typedef errno_t (*sf_data_in_func)(void *cookie, socket_t so, const struct sockaddr *from, mbuf_t *data, mbuf_t *control, sflt_data_flag_t flags);
```

## Parameters 

`cookie`  

Cookie value specified when the filter attach was called.

`so`  

The socket the filter is attached to.

`from`  

The addres the data is from, may be NULL if the socket is connected.

`data`  

The data being received. Control data may appear in the mbuf chain, be sure to check the mbuf types to find control data.

`control`  

Control data being passed separately from the data.

`flags`  

Flags to indicate if this is out of band data or a record.

## Return Value

Return: 0 - The caller will continue with normal processing of the data. EJUSTRETURN - The caller will stop processing the data, the data will not be freed. Anything Else - The caller will free the data and stop processing.

## Discussion

sf_data_in_func is called to filter incoming data. If your filter intercepts data for later reinjection, it must queue all incoming data to preserve the order of the data. Use sock_inject_data_in to later reinject this data if you return EJUSTRETURN. Warning: This filter is on the data path. Do not spend excesive time. Do not wait for data on another socket.
