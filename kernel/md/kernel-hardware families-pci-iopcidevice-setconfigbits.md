# setConfigBits

Sets masked bits in a configuration space register.

``` source
virtual UInt32 setConfigBits(
 UInt8offset,
 UInt32mask,
 UInt32data ); 
```

## Parameters 

`offset`  

An 8-bit offset into configuration space, of which bits 0-1 are ignored.

`mask`  

An 32-bit mask indicating which bits in the value parameter are valid.

`data`  

An 32-bit value to be written in host byte order (big endian on PPC).

## Return Value

The value of the register masked with the mask before the write.

## Overview

This method sets masked bits in a configuration space register on the device by reading and writing the register. The value of the masked bits before the write is returned.
