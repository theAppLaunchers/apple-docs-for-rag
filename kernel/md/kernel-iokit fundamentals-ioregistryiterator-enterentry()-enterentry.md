Recurse into the current entry in the registry iteration.

 void ); 
```

## Overview

This method makes the current entry, ie. the last entry returned by getNextObject et al., the root in a new level of recursion.

enterEntry(const IORegistryPlane *)

Recurse into the current entry in the registry iteration.

exitEntry

Exits a level of recursion, restoring the current entry.

getCurrentEntry

Return the current entry in the registry iteration.

getNextObject

Return the next object in the registry iteration.

getNextObjectFlat

Return the next object in the registry iteration, ignoring the kIORegistryIterateRecursively option.

getNextObjectRecursive

Return the next object in the registry iteration, and enter it.

isValid

Checks that no registry changes have invalidated the iteration.

iterateAll

Iterates all entries (with getNextObject) and returns a set of all returned entries.

iterateOver(const IORegistryPlane *, IOOptionBits)

Create an iterator rooted at the registry root.

iterateOver(IORegistryEntry *, const IORegistryPlane *, IOOptionBits)

Create an iterator rooted at a given registry entry.

reset

Exits all levels of recursion, restoring the iterator to its state at creation.
