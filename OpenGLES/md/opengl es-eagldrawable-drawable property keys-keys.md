# Drawable Property Keys

Keys to specify in the `drawableProperties` dictionary.

## Topics

### Constants

let kEAGLDrawablePropertyColorFormat: String

The key specifying the internal color buffer format for the drawable surface. The value for this key is an `NSString` object that specifies a specific color buffer format. This color buffer format is used by the `EAGLContext` object to create the storage for a renderbuffer. The default value is `kEAGLColorFormatRGBA8`.

Deprecated

let kEAGLDrawablePropertyRetainedBacking: String

The key specifying whether the drawable surface retains its contents after displaying them. The value for this key is an `NSNumber` object containing a `BOOL` data type. If `false`, you may not rely on the contents being the same after the contents are displayed. If `true`, then the contents will not change after being displayed. Setting the value to `true` is recommended only when you need the content to remain unchanged, as using it can result in both reduced performance and additional memory usage. The default value is `false`.
