Instance Method

# accessibilityDirectTouch(\_:options:)

Explicitly set whether this accessibility element is a direct touch area. Direct touch areas passthrough touch events to the app rather than being handled through an assistive technology, such as VoiceOver. The modifier accepts an optional `AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions` option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.

## Discussion

For example, this is how a direct touch area would allow a VoiceOver user to interact with a view with a `rotationEffect` controlled by a `RotationGesture`. The direct touch area would require a user to activate the area before using the direct touch area.

```
var body: some View {
    Rectangle()
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200, alignment: .center)
        .rotationEffect(angle)
        .gesture(rotation)
        .accessibilityDirectTouch(options: .requiresActivation)
}
```
