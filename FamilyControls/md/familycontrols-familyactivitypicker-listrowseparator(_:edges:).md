``` source
nonisolated
func listRowSeparator(
    _ visibility: Visibility,
    edges: VerticalEdge.Set = .all
) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`visibility`  

The visibility of this rowâ€™s separators.

`edges`  

The set of row edges for which this preference applies. The list style might already decide to not display separators for some edges, typically the top edge. The default is `VerticalEdge/Set/all`.

## Discussion

Separators can be presented above and below a row. You can specify to which edge this preference should apply.

This modifier expresses a preference to the containing `List`. The list style is the final arbiter of the separator visibility.

The following example shows a simple grouped list whose row separators are hidden:

```
List {
    ForEach(garage.cars) { car in
        Text(car.model)
            .listRowSeparator(.hidden)
    }
}
.listStyle(.grouped)
```

To change the color of a row separators, use `View/listRowSeparatorTint(_:edges:)`. To hide or change the tint color for a section separators, use `View/listSectionSeparator(_:edges:)` and `View/listSectionSeparatorTint(_:edges:)`.
