``` source
nonisolated
func minimumScaleFactor(_ factor: CGFloat) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`factor`  

A fraction between 0 and 1 (inclusive) you use to specify the minimum amount of text scaling that this view permits.

## Return Value

A view that limits the amount of text downscaling.

## Discussion

Use the `minimumScaleFactor(_:)` modifier if the text you place in a view doesn’t fit and it’s okay if the text shrinks to accommodate. For example, a label with a minimum scale factor of `0.5` draws its text in a font size as small as half of the actual font if needed.

In the example below, the `HStack` contains a `Text` label with a line limit of `1`, that is next to a `TextField`. To allow the label to fit into the available space, the `minimumScaleFactor(_:)` modifier shrinks the text as needed to fit into the available space.

```
HStack {
    Text("This is a long label that will be scaled to fit:")
        .lineLimit(1)
        .minimumScaleFactor(0.5)
    TextField("My Long Text Field", text: $myTextField)
}
```
