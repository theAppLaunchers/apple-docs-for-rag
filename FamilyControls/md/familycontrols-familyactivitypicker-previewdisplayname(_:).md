``` source
nonisolated
func previewDisplayName(_ value: String?) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`value`  

A name for the preview.

## Return Value

A preview that uses the given name.

## Discussion

Apply this modifier to a view inside your `PreviewProvider` implementation to associate a display name with that viewâ€™s preview:

```
struct CircleImage_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        CircleImage()
            .previewDisplayName("Circle")
    }
}
```

Add a name when you have multiple previews together in the canvas that you need to tell apart. The default value is `nil`, in which case Xcode displays a default string.
