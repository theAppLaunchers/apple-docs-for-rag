``` source
nonisolated
func clipped(antialiased: Bool = false) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`antialiased`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the rendering system applies smoothing to the edges of the clipping rectangle.

## Return Value

A view that clips this view to its bounding frame.

## Discussion

Use the `clipped(antialiased:)` modifier to hide any content that extends beyond the layout bounds of the shape.

By default, a viewâ€™s bounding frame is used only for layout, so any content that extends beyond the edges of the frame is still visible.

```
Text("This long text string is clipped")
    .fixedSize()
    .frame(width: 175, height: 100)
    .clipped()
    .border(Color.gray)
```
