``` source
nonisolated
func onDisappear(perform action: (() -> Void)? = nil) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`action`  

The action to perform. If `action` is `nil`, the call has no effect.

## Return Value

A view that triggers `action` after it disappears.

## Discussion

The exact moment that SwiftUI calls this method depends on the specific view type that you apply it to, but the `action` closure doesnâ€™t execute until the view disappears from the interface.
