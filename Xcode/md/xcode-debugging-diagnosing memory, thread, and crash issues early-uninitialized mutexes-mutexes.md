# Uninitialized mutexes

Detects when you use an uninitialized mutex.

## Overview

Use this check to detect when you call `pthread_mutex_lock(_:)` or `pthread_mutex_unlock(_:)` with an uninitialized `pthread_mutex_t` variable. Attempting to use an uninitialized mutex results in an error, and bypasses ordering conditions that exist on a locked mutex. Available in Xcode 8 and later.

### Use of uninitialized mutex in C

In the following example, the `pthread_mutex_lock(_:)` function executes with an uninitialized `pthread_mutex_t` variable:

```
static pthread_mutex_t mutex;
void performWork() {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex); // Error: uninitialized mutex
    // ...
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
}
```

#### Solution

Use the `pthread_once(_:_:)` function to initialize a mutex before you use it.

```
static pthread_once_t once = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;
static pthread_mutex_t mutex;
void init() {    
    pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL);
}
void performWork() {
    pthread_once(&once, init); // Correct
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    // ...
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
}
```
