# Races on collections and other APIs

Detects when one thread accesses a mutable object while another thread is writing to it.

## Overview

In Xcode 9 and later, the Thread Sanitizer detects unsafe thread accesses of Foundation and Core Foundation framework APIs. This feature applies to the following collection types:

- NSMutableArray

- NSMutableDictionary

- CFMutableArray

- CFMutableDictionary

### Collection race with a mutable array

In the following example, the code enumerates a mutable array in one thread while writing to the array from another without synchronizing access:

**Swift**

```
let array: NSMutableArray = []
var sum: Int = 0
// Executed on Thread #1
for value in array {
    sum += value as! Int
}
// Executed on Thread #2
array.add(42)
```

**Objective-C**

```
NSMutableArray *array = [NSMutableArray new];
NSInteger sum = 0;
// Executed on Thread #1
for (id value in array) {  
    sum += [value integerValue];
} 
// Executed on Thread #2
[array addObject:@42];
```

#### Solution

Use Dispatch APIs to coordinate access to `array` across multiple threads.

### Collection race with a mutable dictionary

In the following example, the code enumerates a mutable dictionary in one thread while writing to the dictionary from another without synchronizing access:

```
let dictionary: NSMutableDictionary = [:]
var sum: Int = 0
// Executed on Thread #1
for key in dictionary.keyEnumerator() {
    sum += dictionary[key] as! Int
}
// Executed on Thread #2
dictionary["forty-two"] = 42
```

**Objective-C**

```
NSMutableDictionary *dictionary = [NSMutableDictionary new];
NSInteger sum = 0;
// Executed on Thread #1
for (id key in dictionary) {
    sum += [dictionary[key] integerValue];
}
// Executed on Thread #2
dictionary[@"forty-two"] = @42;
```

#### Solution

Use Dispatch APIs to coordinate access to `dictionary` across multiple threads.
