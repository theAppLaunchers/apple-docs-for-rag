# Source control management

Back up your files, collaborate with others, and tag your releases with source control support in Xcode.

## Overview

*Source control* is the practice of tracking and managing changes to your code. Manage your Xcode project with source control to keep a rich history of the changes you make, and collaborate on code faster and more effectively.

Xcode simplifies source control management with its built-in support for Git. You create a Git *source control repository* that represents your project, and track the changes you make to your project through *commits*. When your code is  
ready, your collaborators can review your changes, suggest alternative approaches, and accept your changes by approving and merging your new code into the main codebase.
