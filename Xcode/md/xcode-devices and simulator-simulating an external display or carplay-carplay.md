# Simulating an external display or CarPlay

Test how your app handles an external display or CarPlay from Simulator.

## Overview

Some iPhone and iPad devices support a wired connection to an external display. When you plug your compatible device into a supported external display, the device mirrors its display to the external display.

In addition to external displays, iPhone devices running iOS 12.0 and later support connecting to CarPlay compatible vehicles. For more information on supporting CarPlay in your app, see CarPlay.

Test your appâ€™s support of external displays or CarPlay in Simulator during development, then test on actual devices.

### Enable an external display or CarPlay

First, build and run your app in Simulator. For more information, see Running your app in Simulator or on a device.

When your app is running in Simulator, choose I/O \> External Displays, then select an external display size or CarPlay. The supported options are:

- 640x480

- 720x480

- 1024x768

- 1280x720 (720p)

- 1920x1080 (1080p)

- 3840x2160 (4K)

- CarPlay

Simulator opens a new window for the external display with the selected size.

Close the external display window, or choose I/O \> External Displays \> Disable to simulate unplugging from the external display.
