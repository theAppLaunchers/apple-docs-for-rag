# EXC_CRASH (SIGQUIT)

Another processes terminated the process, often because the process violated a requirement or timeout.

## Overview

This signal indicates the process terminated at the request of another process that has the privileges to manage its lifetime. It doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that the process crashed, but the process likely misbehaved in a detectable manner. For a command-line process, this signal can also be sent by the user pressing control-\\ although the key binding may vary by shell and configuration.

With iOS and iPadOS keyboard extensions, the host app terminates the keyboard extension if it takes too long to load. Although the exception information is different in a watchdog termination, investigate `EXC_CRASH (SIGQUIT)` with the same techniques discussed in Addressing watchdog terminations.

### Exceptions

EXC_ARITHMETIC

An arithmetic problem terminated the process, often because of division by zero or a floating-point error.

EXC_BAD_ACCESS

A bad access to memory terminated the process.

EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)

A bus error terminated the process, often because the process tried to access a misaligned or invalid address in memory, or due to a pointer authentication failure.

EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)

A memory segmentation fault terminated the process, often because the process tried to access an invalid or out-of-bounds address in memory.

EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) and EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (SIGILL)

A trace trap or invalid CPU instruction interrupted the process, often because the process violated a requirement or timeout.

EXC_CRASH

The process crashed.

EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)

The process terminated because it received an abort signal.

EXC_CRASH (SIGKILL)

The operating system terminated the process, often because a background task violated a requirement, device resources were limited, or the user force quit the app.

EXC_CRASH (SIGSYS)

A bad argument to a system call terminated the process.

EXC_CRASH (SIGTERM)

A software termination signal terminated the process.

EXC_GUARD

The process violated a guarded resource protection, often related to file descriptors.

EXC_RESOURCE

The operating system stopped the process because the process exceeded a limit on resource consumption, like CPU time or memory.
