# Deallocation of deallocated memory

Detects attempts to free deallocated memory.

## Overview

Use this check to detect when you call `free` on deallocated memory, commonly referred to as a *double free* error. Attempting to deallocate memory more than once can result in a crash or other unpredictable behavior. Available in Xcode 7 and later.

### Deallocation of freed memory in C

In the following example, the code deallocates the `p_int` variable after the call to free its memory:

```
```

#### Solution

Ensure that you call the `free` function just once for memory you allocate.
