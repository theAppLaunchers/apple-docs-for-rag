# Creating width and device variants of strings

Change a localized string for different interface widths and devices.

## Overview

Important

In Xcode 15 and later, string catalogs are the recommended way to create width and device variants of strings. In earlier versions of Xcode, use strings and `stringsdict` files. For more information about string catalogs, see Localizing and varying text with a string catalog.

You can use a `.stringsdict` file to provide variants of a string for different view widths and for different devices. For example, display a different string for an iOS device in landscape or in portrait mode, or display a different string when your iPad app built with Mac Catalyst runs on a Mac.

A `.stringsdict` file is a property list that defines plural, width, and device variants of localizable strings. The `.stringsdict` file contains a dictionary of key-value pairs where the values are either a plural, width, or device rule.

The key for a rule is the string that you pass to Text structures, the NSLocalizedString macro, and similar APIs in your code. The rule can be a plural, width, or device rule that determines which formatted string the macro returns.

To create plural variants for formatted strings that contain amounts, see Localizing strings that contain plurals.

### Add a strings dictionary file to your project

To add a `.stringsdict` file to your project, choose File \> New \> File. In the sheet that appears, select the platform, enter `strings` in the Filter field, select Stringsdict File, and click Next. In the dialog that appears, enter a name for the file, choose a location, and click Create.

### Provide string variants for different widths

A *width rule* specifies variants for different available widths in the user interface. It contains a single dictionary with a single key-value pair. The key in the dictionary is `NSStringVariableWidthRuleType` and the value is another dictionary with key-value pairs for each variant. The key for a variant is a width and the value is a string.

In the following `.stringsdict` file, for the `hello `string in the code,the width variations are `1`, `22`, and `53`, and the values are `Hi`, `Hello`, and `Greetings and Salutations`:

```

        hello

            NSStringVariableWidthRuleType

                1
                Hi
                22
                Hello
                53
                Greetings and Salutations

```

For UILabel objects, the width is in em units that fit across the app window; otherwise, the width doesnâ€™t have an associated unit.

The width rule defines variants for a range of widths:

- If the width is between two numerically sequential keys, the API returns the variant with the smaller key.

- If the width is less than all keys, the API returns the variant for the smallest key.

In the code above, if the width is `2`, the macro returns `Hi`. If the width is `55`, the macro returns `Hello`.

To get a variant for a specific width in your code, see the variantFittingPresentationWidth(_:) method.

### Provide device-specific string variants

A *device rule* specifies a different string depending on the device. For example, your universal app may present different instructions to the user when running on an iOS device than when running on a Mac.

A device rule contains a single dictionary with a single key-value pair. The key is `NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType` and the value is a dictionary with the following optional key-value pairs:

| Key         | Description                            |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| appletv     | The string to use on Apple TV.         |
| applevision | The string to use on Apple Vision Pro. |
| applewatch  | The string to use on Apple Watch.      |
| ipad        | The string to use on iPad.             |
| iphone      | The string to use on iPhone.           |
| ipod        | The string to use on iPod.             |
| mac         | The string to use on Mac.              |

In the following `.stringsdict` file, when you pass `UserInstructions` as the string in your code, it returns `Tap here` when the app runs on an iPhone, `Click here` when it runs on a Mac, and `Press here` when it runs on an Apple TV:

```

    UserInstructions

        NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType

            iphone
            Tap here
            mac
            Click here
            appletv
            Press here

```
