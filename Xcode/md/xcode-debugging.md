# Debugging

Identify and address issues in your app using the Xcode debugger, Xcode Organizer, Metal debugger, and Instruments.

## Topics

### Essentials

Diagnosing and resolving bugs in your running app

Inspect your app to isolate bugs, locate crashes, identify excess system-resource usage, visualize memory bugs, and investigate problems in its appearance.

### Debugging strategies

Diagnosing issues in the appearance of a running app

Inspect your running app to investigate issues in the appearance and placement of the content it displays.

Diagnosing memory, thread, and crash issues early

Identify runtime crashes and undefined behaviors in your app during testing using Xcode’s sanitizer tools.

Analyzing HTTP traffic with Instruments

Measure HTTP-based network performance and usage of your apps.

Detecting when your app contacts domains that may be profiling users

Use Instruments to assess whether your app or its third-party SDKs connect to domains that may profile users.

### Graphics

Metal developer workflows

Locate and fix issues related to your app’s use of the Metal API and GPU functions.

Metal debugger

Debug and profile your Metal workload with a GPU trace.

### Breakpoints and variables

Setting breakpoints to pause your running app

Specify where your app pauses when running the debugger to investigate bugs.

Stepping through code and inspecting variables to isolate bugs

Find the cause of your bugs by watching variables change as you step through your source code in the debugger.

### Reports

Building your app to include debugging information

Configure Xcode to produce the symbol information for debugging and crash reports.

Diagnosing issues using crash reports and device logs

Use crash reports and device logs to debug app issues.

### Entitlements

Diagnosing Issues with Entitlements

Verify your app’s entitlements at every stage of development to track down errors during distribution.

## See Also

### Tuning and debugging

Devices and Simulator

Configure and manage devices connected to your Mac or devices in Simulator and use them to run your app.

Performance and metrics

Measure, investigate, and address the use of system resources and issues impacting performance using Instruments and Xcode Organizer.

Testing

Develop and run tests to detect logic failures, UI problems, and performance regressions.
