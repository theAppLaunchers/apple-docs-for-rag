# Overflow of C++ containers

Detects when you access a C++ container outside its bounds.

## Overview

Use this check to detect when you access a libc++ container beyond the region `[container.begin(), container.end()]`, even when the accessed memory is in a heap-allocated buffer the container uses internally. Available in Xcode 7 and later.

Note

This check is in a disabled state by default because it requires building all statically linked libraries using `std::vector` with an enabled Address Sanitizer. To enable this check, choose the Yes option for the Enable C++ Container Overflow Checks setting.

### Vector overflow in C++

In the following example, the `vector` variable has valid indexes in the range `[0,2]`, but the accessed index is `3`, which causes an overflow:

```
std::vector vector;
vector.push_back(0);
vector.push_back(1);
vector.push_back(2);
auto *pointer = &vector[0];
return pointer[3]; // Error: out of bounds access for vector
```

#### Solution

Add a bounds check before attempting to access a container at a specific index.
