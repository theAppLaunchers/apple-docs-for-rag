# Xcode Cloud

Automatically build, test, and distribute your apps with Xcode Cloud to verify changes and create high-quality apps.

## Overview

Xcode Cloud lets you adopt *continuous integration and delivery* (CI/CD), a standard software development practice that helps you develop and maintain your code and deliver apps to testers and users. Xcode Cloud is a CI/CD system that combines the tools you use to create apps and frameworks for Apple platforms: Xcode, TestFlight, and App Store Connect.

With Xcode Cloud, you can automatically and frequently:

- Build your project.

- Run tests and perform verifications.

- Distribute builds to testers and gather their feedback with TestFlight while protecting user privacy.

After successfully verifying a new version of your app with Xcode Cloud and TestFlight, you can quickly release it on the App Store.

For more information about continuous integration and delivery, see About continuous integration and delivery with Xcode Cloud. To learn more about configuring your project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud, see Configuring your first Xcode Cloud workflow.

Note

For additional information about Xcode Cloud that includes videos from WWDC21 and WWDC22, see The Xcode Cloud toolkit.
