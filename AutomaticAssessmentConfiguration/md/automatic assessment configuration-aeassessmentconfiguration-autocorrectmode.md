## Discussion

Users can turn on autocorrect in the Settings app (General \> Keyboard \> Auto-Correction). An assessment session disables this feature by default, but you can allow it by setting autocorrectMode in the AEAssessmentConfiguration instance that you use to initialize a session. Set the modeâ€™s value to some combination of the the values from the AEAssessmentConfiguration.AutocorrectMode structure.
