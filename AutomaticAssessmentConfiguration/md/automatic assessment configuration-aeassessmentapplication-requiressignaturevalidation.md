Instance Property

# requiresSignatureValidation

A Boolean that indicates whether the session requires the app to have a valid code signature to run.

Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+

``` source
var requiresSignatureValidation: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When this property is `true`, as it is by default, the system requires that the appâ€™s code signature is valid, and that either Apple distributes the app, or the developer notarizes the app or distributes it through the App Store. You can set the value to `false` to relax these requirements, but do so with caution, because that greatly reduces the security of your assessment session.
