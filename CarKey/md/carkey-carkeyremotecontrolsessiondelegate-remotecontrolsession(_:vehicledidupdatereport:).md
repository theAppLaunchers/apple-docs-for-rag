    _ session: CarKeyRemoteControlSession,
    vehicleDidUpdateReport: VehicleReport
)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`session`  

The current session.

`vehicleDidUpdateReport`  

The updated vehicle report, which you can use to make changes immediately.

## Discussion

When information for a vehicle changes, the session notifies its delegate so you can make any changes. To save time, use the provided report rather than requesting the report again from the sessionâ€™s vehicleReports property. The system executes this method on the dispatch queue you specified when you started the session.
