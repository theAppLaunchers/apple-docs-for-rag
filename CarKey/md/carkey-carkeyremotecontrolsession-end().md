## Discussion

When you no longer need to access the vehicle information, call this method to end the session. If the session isnâ€™t currently active when you call this method, it throws an error.

The system automatically ends a session when your app enters the background. Upon reentering the foreground, you must create a new session to communicate with your vehicle again.
