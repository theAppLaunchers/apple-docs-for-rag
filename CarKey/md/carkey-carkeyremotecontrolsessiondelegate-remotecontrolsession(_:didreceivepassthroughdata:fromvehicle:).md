    fromVehicle vehicleID: String
)
```

## Parameters 

`session`  

The current session.

`didReceivePassthroughData`  

The passthrough data that the vehicle sent. Use the data to determine what actions to take, if any.

`vehicleID`  

The identifier of the vehicle that sent the data. This identifier is the same string in the identifier property of the vehicle report.

## Discussion

If the vehicle sends data, the system delivers it to your app using this method. You are responsible for the data your vehicles produce, and for decoding that data in your implementation of this method. The session doesnâ€™t save or modify the data in any way.

The system executes this method on the dispatch queue you specified when you started the session.
