## Overview

Use a RemoteKeylessEntryConfigurableEnduringAction object to store details about an action that you can stop or let run to completion. For example, you might use this type of action to lower or raise the top of a convertible vehicle. The object stores information about the vehicle feature to control and the action to take on that feature. It also stores the identifier for the vehicle itself.

After you create a RemoteKeylessEntryConfigurableEnduringAction object, call your sessionâ€™s perform(_:) method to execute the action. Use the returned RemoteKeylessEntryAction.ExecutionRequest object to determine the success or failure of the request.
