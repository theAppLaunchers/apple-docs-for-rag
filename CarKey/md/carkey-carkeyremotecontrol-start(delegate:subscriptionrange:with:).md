iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.3+watchOS 9.0+

``` source
class func start(
    delegate: any CarKeyRemoteControlSessionDelegate,
    subscriptionRange subscriptionFunctionIDRange: ClosedRange? = nil,
    with delegateCallbackQueue: DispatchQueue? = nil
) async throws -> CarKeyRemoteControlSession
```

## Parameters 

`delegate`  

The object you use to receive data from the vehicle and handle connection issues. You must specify this object at session-creation time, and can only change it by creating a new session. This object must adopt the CarKeyRemoteControlSessionDelegate protocol.

`subscriptionFunctionIDRange`  

The range of function IDs your app supports for the current session. Each vehicle feature you can control remotely has an associated function identifier code. Use this parameter to limit the features accessible to the current person. For example, you might include a subset of features to limit the actions of someone who isn’t the vehicle’s primary owner.

`delegateCallbackQueue`  

The queue on which to execute the methods of your delegate object. If you specify `nil`, CarKey creates a new serial dispatch queue for you.

## Return Value

A new session object.

## Discussion

This method creates a new session object each time you call it. You can have only one active session at a time. If you call this method while a session is already active, the method waits until the previous session becomes invalid before returning the new session. The session object gives you access to the vehicles that your company makes and that the owner added to their Apple Wallet.
