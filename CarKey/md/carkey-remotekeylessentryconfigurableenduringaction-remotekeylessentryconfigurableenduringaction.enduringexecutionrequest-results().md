``` source
final func results() async throws -> ExecutionStatus
```

A structure that contains the vehicle-specific status code from the vehicle.

## Discussion

After you call your sessionâ€™s perform(_:) method to send an action request to a vehicle, call this method to await the results of that request. Upon the successful completion of the request, this method returns the vehicle-provided status code. If an error occurs, this method throws the error instead.
