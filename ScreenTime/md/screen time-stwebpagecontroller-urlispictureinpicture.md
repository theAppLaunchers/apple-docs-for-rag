@MainActor
var urlIsPictureInPicture: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value is NO. Set this value when the webpage starts or stops displaying a Picture in Picture window.

Important

Set this value to NO prior to changing url if the new webpage at that URL ends all currently displayed Picture in Picture windows, and wonâ€™t immediately display a new one.
