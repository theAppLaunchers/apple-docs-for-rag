## Mentioned in 

Upgrading Account Security With an Account Authentication Modification Extension

## Overview

Your app uses this class to initiate an upgrade from a weak password to a strong system-generated one. After creating the request, your app initiates the upgrade process by instantiating an ASAccountAuthenticationModificationController object and calling perform(_:) on it. The system invokes your authentication modification extension to complete the upgrade.

For details about how to enforce requirements on the password, such as minimum length or requiring both letters and numbers, see ASAccountAuthenticationModificationPasswordGenerationRequirements.
