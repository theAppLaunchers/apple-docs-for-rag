## Discussion

This method deletes existing credential identities in the store and saves the newly provided credential identity objects. On failure, this method calls the callback with an error with domain ASCredentialIdentityStoreErrorDomain and doesnâ€™t save any of the objects in `newCredentialIdentities` to the store.
