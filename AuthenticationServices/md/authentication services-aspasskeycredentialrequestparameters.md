``` source
class ASPasskeyCredentialRequestParameters
```

## Overview

The system creates instances of this class to handle active passkey requests, and passes them to your extension by calling prepareCredentialList(for:requestParameters:). Use the properties of the given request parameters object, along with the passkey credential that the person chooses, to construct a passkey credential response that you return to the system using completeAssertionRequest(using:completionHandler:).
