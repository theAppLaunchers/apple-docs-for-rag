iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOS 14.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
func saveCredentialIdentities(
    _ credentialIdentities: [any ASCredentialIdentity],
    completion: ((Bool, (any Error)?) -> Void)? = nil
)
```

``` source
func saveCredentialIdentities(_ credentialIdentities: [any ASCredentialIdentity]) async throws
```

## Parameters 

`credentialIdentities`  

A list of credential identities to save.

`completion`  

An optional completion handler that runs when the operation finishes.

## Discussion

Call this method if the credential store supports incremental updates to add new credential identities. Otherwise, call this method passing all credential identities. If any of the credential identities in the `credentialIdentities` array already exist in the store, this method overwrites them with the values in the array.

On failure, this method calls the callback with an error with domain ASCredentialIdentityStoreErrorDomain and doesnâ€™t save any of the objects in `credentialIdentities` to the store.
