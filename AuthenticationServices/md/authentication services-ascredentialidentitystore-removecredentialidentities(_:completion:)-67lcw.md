``` source
func removeCredentialIdentities(
    _ credentialIdentities: [any ASCredentialIdentity],
    completion: ((Bool, (any Error)?) -> Void)? = nil
)
```

``` source
func removeCredentialIdentities(_ credentialIdentities: [any ASCredentialIdentity]) async throws
```

## Parameters 

`credentialIdentities`  

A list of credential identities to remove.

`completion`  

An optional completion handler that runs when the operation finishes.

## Discussion

Call this method if the credential store supports incremental updates to remove previously-added credential identities. On failure, this method calls the callback with an error with domain ASCredentialIdentityStoreErrorDomain and doesnâ€™t remove any of the objects in `credentialIdentities` from the store.
