# Creating a refresh request

Refresh a non-expired token instead of sending a new login request.

## Overview

The system sends a refresh request instead of a login request when a token hasn’t expired yet and the refreshEndpointURL is set. The refresh request also sends a server nonce request before it begins.

A refresh request uses the previous refresh token to request a new token without prompting the user for credentials. The system attempts it when the existing token hasn’t expired and the time since the last full login hasn’t exceeded the `LoginFrequency` in the Device Management profile. It doesn’t apply to User Secure Enclave key authentication, because the user isn’t prompted for credentials.

The refresh request is a JSON Object Signing and Encryption object (JOSE) object that’s formatted per RFC 7519 and signed with the `DeviceSigningKey` and `ES256` per RFC 7515. Processing the refresh network request and response is the same as for a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) login response. For more information, see Creating a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) login response.

The following table specifies the header parameters that the system uses to create a refresh request:

| Key | Value | Notes |
|----|----|----|
| `typ` | `platformsso-refresh-request+jwt` | Required. |
| `alg` | `ES256` | Required. The signing algorithm. Only ES256 is supported. |
| `kid` | The base-64 encoded SHA256 hash of the ANSI X9.63 formatted public key for the signing identity | Required. |
| `x5c` | The base-64 encoded device signing certificate from saveCertificate(_:keyType:). | Optional. If the certificate is set, the system includes it here. The value is base-64 encoded per RFC 7517. |
| `loginConfiguration.customRefreshRequestHeaderClaims` |  | Optional. If present, adds key value pairs to the JWT. |

The following table specifies the body parameters that the system uses to create a refresh request:

| Key | Value | Notes |
|----|----|----|
| `client_id` | clientID | Required. The open id `client_id` for login. |
| `iss` | clientID | Required. Per RFC 7523 Section 3. |
| `exp` | 5 minutes from now | Required. Per RFC 7523 Section 3. |
| `scope` | `openid offline_access` and additionalScopes | Required. The requested scope for the assertion. The default value is `openid offline_access` and the system appends any additional ones to it. The default additional scope is `urn:apple:platformsso` If there’s an embedded assertion, this value must match the scope in the embedded assertion JWT. |
| `nonce` | A nonce value | Required. A unique nonce for this request. |
| `aud` | tokenEndpointURL | Required. The refresh endpoint URL host and path. |
| `iat` | The current time | Required. The IdP needs to verify this value. |
| serverNonceClaimName or `request_nonce` | The value that the nonce request returns. | Required. The key name is either the serverNonceClaimName or the default value `request_nonce`. |
| `grant_type` | `refresh_token` | Required. |
| `refresh_token` | The previous refresh token | Required. |
| `jwe_crypto` | A dictionary with the following three values: | Required. The system uses the values in the dictionary to encrypt the response. |
| `enc` | `A256GCM` | Required. The supported encryption algorithm for the response per RFC 7518 Section 4.6. |
| `alg` | `ECDH-ES` | Required. The supported key agreement algorithm for the response per RFC 7518 Section 5.3. |
| `apv` | The base-64 URL encoded `PartyVInfo` to use for the response | Required. Per RFC 7518 Section 4.6.1.3. The value for `PartyVInfo` to encrypt the response. See Configure Concat KDF in Creating an encrypted embedded assertion for more information. |
| `loginConfiguration.customRefreshRequestBodyClaims` |  | Optional. If present, adds the key value pairs to the JWT. |

The following code provides an example of a refresh request:

}.[Signature]
