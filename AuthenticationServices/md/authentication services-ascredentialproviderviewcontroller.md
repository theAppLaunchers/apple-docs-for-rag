A view controller that a password manager app uses to extend AutoFill.

iOS 12.0+iPadOS 12.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+macOS 11.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
@MainActor
class ASCredentialProviderViewController
```

## Overview

To integrate a password, passkey, or one-time passcode manager app with AutoFill:

1.  Add a Credential Provider Extension target to your project that subclasses ASCredentialProviderViewController. Add the AutoFill Credential Provider Entitlement to both the extension and its containing app.

2.  Override the view controllerâ€™s prepareCredentialList(for:) method to prepare a view with a list of credentials that the person can choose from after opening your extension from the AutoFill suggestions list.

3.  Optionally add ASPasswordCredentialIdentity and ASPasskeyCredentialIdentity instances to the shared ASCredentialIdentityStore to make identities available directly in the AutoFill suggestions list. Then override the provideCredentialWithoutUserInteraction(for:) method to provide the associated credentials when the person taps a suggestion.

4.  Optionally, override the prepareInterfaceForExtensionConfiguration() method to specify a configuration interface that you can show when people first enable your credentials manager in Settings.

Note

This class ignores calls from Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst.

## Topics

### Configuring the credential provider extension

func prepareInterfaceForExtensionConfiguration()

Prepares the interface to enable the user to configure the extension.

class ASCredentialIdentityStore

func prepareOneTimeCodeCredentialList(for: [ASCredentialServiceIdentifier])

Prepares the interface to display a list of one-time passcodes (OTPs) that people can select from.

func prepareInterface(forPasskeyRegistration: any ASCredentialRequest)

Prepare the view controller to show user interface for registering a new passkey.

func prepareInterfaceToProvideCredential(for: any ASCredentialRequest)

Prepare the view controller to show user interface for providing the requested credential.

func provideCredentialWithoutUserInteraction(for: any ASCredentialRequest)

Attempts to provide the user-requested credential with no further user interaction.

func performWithoutUserInteractionIfPossible(passkeyRegistration: ASPasskeyCredentialRequest)

Perform a conditional passkey registration, if possible.

class ASCredentialServiceIdentifier

An identifier representing a particular service for which the user needs a credential, like a web site.

protocol ASCredentialRequest

A protocol that describes a request from the user for your extension to provide a credential.

class ASPasswordCredentialRequest

class ASPasskeyCredentialRequestParameters

A class that represents information about a passkey credential request.

### Providing text to AutoFill

func prepareInterfaceForUserChoosingTextToInsert()

### Recognizing errors

struct ASExtensionError

A credential provider extension error.

let ASExtensionErrorDomain: String

The domain for a credential provider extension error.

enum Code

The codes for a credential provider extension error.

### Accessing settings

class ASSettingsHelper

A class that opens Settings and navigates to the settings for configuring credential providers.

### Deprecated methods

func provideCredentialWithoutUserInteraction(for: ASPasswordCredentialIdentity)

Attempts to provide the user-requested credential with no further user interaction.

Deprecated

func prepareInterfaceToProvideCredential(for: ASPasswordCredentialIdentity)
