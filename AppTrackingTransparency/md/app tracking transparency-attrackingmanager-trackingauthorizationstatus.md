## Return Value

Information about your applicationâ€™s tracking authorization status. Users are able to grant or deny developers tracking privileges on a per-app basis. Application developers must call `requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler:` for the ability to track users.

## Discussion

If the user has not yet been prompted to approve access, the return value will either be `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined`, or `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted` if this value is managed. Once the user has been prompted, the return value will be either `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied` or `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized`.

Use the trackingAuthorizationStatus property to check authorization status.
