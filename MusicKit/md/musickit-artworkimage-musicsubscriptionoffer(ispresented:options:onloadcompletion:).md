Initiates the process of presenting a sheet with subscription offers for Apple Music when the `isPresented` binding is `true`.

MusicKitSwiftUIiOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+

``` source
nonisolated
func musicSubscriptionOffer(
    isPresented: Binding,
    options: MusicSubscriptionOffer.Options = .default,
    onLoadCompletion: @escaping ((any Error)?) -> Void = { _ in }
) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`isPresented`  

A binding to a Boolean value that you can set to `true` to show a sheet with subscription offers for Apple Music.

`options`  

Options to use for loading the subscription offer for Apple Music.

`onLoadCompletion`  

The function to call upon completing the initial loading process for this subscription offer. The subscription offer UI becomes visible when it calls this function with the error argument as `nil`. If there is an error in the loading process, the subscription offer calls this function with a non-`nil` error, and it resets the `isPresented` binding to `false`.

## Discussion

The example below displays a simple button that the user can activate to begin presenting subscription offers for Apple Music. The action handler of this button initiates the presentation of those offers by setting the `isShowingOffer` variable to `true`.

```
struct MusicSubscriptionOfferButton: View {
    @State var isShowingOffer = false
    var body: some View {
        Button("Apple Music Subscription Offer") {
            isShowingOffer = true
        }
        .musicSubscriptionOffer(isPresented: $isShowingOffer)
    }
}
```

You can also configure the Apple Music subscription offer by creating an instance of `MusicSubscriptionOffer.Options`, setting relevant properties on it, and passing it to `.musicSubscriptionOffer(â€¦)`. For example, to present contextual offers that highlight a specific album, you can configure the subscription offer like the following:

```
struct MusicSubscriptionOfferButton: View {
    var album: Album
    @State var isShowingOffer = false
    @State var offerOptions = MusicSubscriptionOffer.Options(
        affiliateToken: "", 
        campaignToken: ""
    )

    var body: some View {
        Button("Apple Music Subscription Offer") {
            offerOptions.itemID = album.id
            isShowingOffer = true
        }
        .musicSubscriptionOffer(
            isPresented: $isShowingOffer, 
            options: offerOptions
        )
    }
}
```

The initial value of `offerOptions` includes relevant tokens (affiliate and campaign tokens) that allow you to receive compensation for referring new Apple Music subscribers. For more information, see this presentation of the Apple Services Performance Partners Program.

You may also set `isShowingOffer` to `false` to programmatically dismiss the subscription offer (or to abort its loading process).
