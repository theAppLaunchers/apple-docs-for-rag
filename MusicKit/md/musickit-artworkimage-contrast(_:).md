func contrast(_ amount: Double) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`amount`  

The intensity of color contrast to apply. negative values invert colors in addition to applying contrast.

## Return Value

A view that applies color contrast to this view.

## Discussion

Apply contrast to a view to increase or decrease the separation between similar colors in the view.

In the example below, the `contrast(_:)` modifier is applied to a set of red squares each containing a contrasting green inner circle. At each step in the loop, the `contrast(_:)` modifier changes the contrast of the circle/square view in 20% increments. This ranges from -20% contrast (yielding inverted colors â€” turning the red square to pale-green and the green circle to mauve), to neutral-gray at 0%, to 100% contrast (bright-red square / bright-green circle). Applying negative contrast values, as shown in the -20% square, will apply contrast in addition to inverting colors.

    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(Color.green)
            .frame(width: 25, height: 25, alignment: .center)
    }
}
