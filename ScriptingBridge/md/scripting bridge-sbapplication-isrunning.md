Instance Property

# isRunning

A Boolean that indicates whether the target application represented by the receiver is running.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.5+

``` source
var isRunning: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

true if the application is running, false otherwise.

This may be true for instances initialized with a bundle identifier or URL because `SBApplication` launches the application only when itâ€™s necessary to send it an event.
