# Budget Orders

Manage your payment model.

## Overview

To use budget orders, you need to receive approval from Apple. Search Ads payment model options include pay-as-you-go (`PAYG)` or standard monthly invoicing (`LOC`). Use either `PAYG` or `LOC`, but not both. Refer to the Search Ads help for billing details.

In the API, `LOC` invoicing details are in the LOCInvoiceDetails object. `PAYG` invoicing details are in the BudgetOrder object. To confirm your payment model, call Get User ACL and check the PaymentModel field in the UserAcl response object. If you donâ€™t have a payment model set up, you can still create campaigns, but you need to select a payment model before a campaign is eligible to run.
