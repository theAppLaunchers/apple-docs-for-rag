# Custom Product Pages

View Custom Product Page details.

## Overview

In iOS 15 and later, you can use custom product pages that you build in App Store Connect to create ad variations in the Apple Search Ads Campaign Management API to promote your apps.

To create a custom product page ad, use the following workflow:

1.  Use Get Product Pages to fetch your `productPageId`.

2.  Use Get Product Page Locales to fetch locale metadata and supported languages. Verify that your custom product page locale and asset data match the language and device types in your campaign AdGroup.

3.  Use Create a Creative with your `productPageId` to obtain a `creativeId`.

4.  Use Create an Ad with a `creativeId` to assign a custom product page to an AdGroup. Each ad group can have one custom product page. For information about how to update a custom product page ad group assignment, see Update an Ad.

5.  Use Get Ad-Level Reports to track the performance of ads in your campaigns. These details help you optimize your Apple Search Ads campaigns to deliver a contextualized customer experience.

Note

If youâ€™ve been using Creative Sets with the API, see section 4.1 in Apple Search Ads Campaign Management API 4 for Creative Sets deprecation details.
