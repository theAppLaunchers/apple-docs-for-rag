## Discussion

To update campaign negative keywords, use the associated `campaignId` in the URI. The `id` in the payload must belong to a negative keyword that exists inside the campaign in the URI. Use `PAUSED` or `ACTIVE` values to update the `status` field. Use partial updates to edit a subset of object properties without having to include all object properties in the payload. For more information, see the Use Partial Updates section of Using Apple Search Ads API Functionality.
