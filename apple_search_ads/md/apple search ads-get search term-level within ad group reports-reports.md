## Discussion

Use this endpoint to fetch reports with a high volume of search terms in your campaign. See ReportingSearchTerm for Condition operators and field values to filter results with a Selector.

The limit for search term-level reports is 10 impressions. Search term-level reports only support a `timeZone` value of `ORTZ`. The `orderBy` Selector specifies fields to sort the records list by `ASCENDING` or `DESCENDING`. All ReportingSearchTerm fields are available to the `orderBy` Selector.
