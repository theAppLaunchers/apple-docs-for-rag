# CountryCriteria

The defined targeted audience by country or region.

Search Ads 2.0+

``` source
object CountryCriteria
```

## Properties

`included`

`[string]`

The dimension to include targeted users by country or region.

Note

For reports, `countryCriteria` must be the same location as the specified CountryOrRegion.

## Discussion

Use Search for Geolocations with `entity` to search for and retrieve geolocations. Then use geotargeting dimensions `country`, `adminArea`, and `locality` in the TargetingDimensions payload with Create an Ad Group and Update an Ad Group endpoints. For the country dimension, use two-letter country codes in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code format. Campaigns that serve multiple countries or regions canâ€™t use geotargeting. Use UpdateCampaignRequest to clear geotargeting from a campaign.
