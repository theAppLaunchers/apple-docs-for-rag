## Discussion

Use this endpoint to update or replace an Ad. Use your `adId` in the resource path. The follow-up step is to create an Ad using your `creativeId`. See Create an Ad. You can assign one active custom product page to an ad group. For information about how to edit a subset of object properties without having to include all object properties in the payload, see the Use Partial Updates section in Using Apple Search Ads API Functionality.
