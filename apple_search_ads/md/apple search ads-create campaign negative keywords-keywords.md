## Overview

Note

If you create duplicate keywords, the payload response indicates an error, but the call returns with a 200 status code.

- 400: An invalid query or missing required parameters.

- 401: An unauthenticated call fails to get the requested response.

- 403: Insufficient rights to the resource.

- 404: The API canâ€™t locate the resource.

- 429: The API calls exceed rate-limit thresholds. See the Rate Limits subsection of Calling the Apple Search Ads API.

- 500: The Apple Search Ads server is temporarily down or unreachable. The request may be valid, but you need to retry it later.

## Discussion

Negative keywords prevent your ad from showing up in App Store searches. Negative keywords can belong to a campaign or an ad group.

To create campaign negative keywords, use the associated `campaignId` in the URI.
