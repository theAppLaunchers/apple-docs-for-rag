An indicator that varies over time to help you incrementally increase the likelihood of your ad showing in searches in the App Store. A `suggestedBidAmount` isnâ€™t a representation of a bid floor or ceiling. A `suggestedBidAmount` is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, historical data related to past performance and recommendations. Actual outcomes, including changes in spend and average CPA, may vary.
