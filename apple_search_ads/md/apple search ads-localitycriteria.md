Search Ads 2.0+

``` source
object LocalityCriteria
```

## Properties

`included`

`[string]`

The dimension to include targeted users by locality. For example, in the United States, a locality dimension is a city.

This parameter doesnâ€™t support the `excluded` attribute.

```
"locality": {
      "included": [
        "US|CA|Cupertino"
      ]
    },
```

## Discussion

A `locality` is a city or the equivalent according to its associated `adminArea`.

Use the Search for Geolocations endpoint with the `entity` query parameter to search for and retrieve geolocations. Then use geotargeting dimensions `country`, `adminArea`, and `locality` with Create an Ad Group and Update an Ad Group endpoints.
