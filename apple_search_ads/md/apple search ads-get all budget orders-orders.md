## Discussion

This call retrieves all assigned budget orders for your organization. It also returns completed and canceled orders. Budget orders also return when you use the Create a Campaign or Update a Campaign endpoints.

You can’t set budget order invoicing through the API. You can only fetch a budget order using Get a Budget Order or the Get All Budget Orders API call.
