Fourth album Shields brought a new collaborative spirit to the band."

Equipped with a bass, drums, vintage keyboards, and a mean sense of humor, the pair created a veritable maelstrom of noise as Death from Above 1979. After two blistering EPs, the duo put out their debut LP, You're a Woman, I'm a Machine, on Vice Records, showcasing a tighter, more accessible sound\u2014although still incredibly noisy and brash by pop standards. The buzz surrounding the duo took them around the world, but internal strife brought them to a breaking point in 2006. Grainger went solo under his own name, and Keeler explored electronic avenues with MSTRKRFT before the two reunited in 2014. Their comeback album, The Physical World, proved that their noisy rock formula hadn't lost any of its power during their hiatus."

Operatic in range, emotionally compelling, and filled with drama, it's the talent that anchors the baroque pop group. Breaking out with the Mercury Music Prize-winning I Am a Bird Now in 2005, the album saw Hegarty channeling her affinity for gothic imagery into unconventional art-pop songs. She's since worked with avant-garde musicians like the experimental composer Nico Muhly, while also releasing a run of live projects that showcase the power of her vocals."
