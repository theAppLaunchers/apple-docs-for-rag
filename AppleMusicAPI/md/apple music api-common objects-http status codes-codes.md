|----|----|----|
| 200 | OK | The request was successful; no errors or faults. |
| 201 | Created | Creation request was successful. |
| 202 | Accepted | Although the modification request was acceptable, it may not have completed. |

| 302 | Found | Content definitely available at a specific URL. |
| 400 | Bad Request | The request wasn’t accepted as formed. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | The request wasn’t accepted because its authorization is missing or invalid due to an issue with the developer token.  (For personal endpoints) Authorization issues may occur because the user wasn’t signed in or didn’t have a valid Apple Music subscription.
