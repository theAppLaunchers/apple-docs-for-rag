object Relationship
```

## Properties

`href`

`string`

A URL subpath that fetches the relationship resources as the primary object. This member is only present in responses.

`next`

`string`

Link to the next page of resources in the relationship. Contains the `offset` query parameter that specifies the next page. See `Fetch Resources by Page`.

`data`

`[`Resource`]`

 (Required) 

One or more destination objects.

`meta`

Relationship.Meta

Contextual information about the relationship for the request or response.

## Discussion

A to-one relationship contains a single object in the `data` array.

The rules that apply to the members of this object are:

- Must contain one of these members: `href`, `data`, or `meta`.

- If a to-many relationship, may contain the `next` member.
