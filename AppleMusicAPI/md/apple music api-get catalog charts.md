## Discussion

If successful, the HTTP status code is 200 (OK) and the response contains an object where `results` contains chart collections. The members for the collections are the chart types in the request and the values are `Chart` objects. The `data` member of each `Chart` object contains an array of the corresponding resource ordered by popularity. For example, if the request contains the `songs` chart type, the object contains a `songs` member with a value that is a `Chart` object containing `Song` objects. This may be a paginated response. For more information, see `Fetch Resources by Page`.

If unsuccessful, the HTTP status code indicates the error and the details are in the errors array. For more information, see Handling Requests and Responses.
