## Overview

The `MPSCNNBinaryConvolution` optionally first binarizes the input image and then convolves the result with a set of binary-valued filters, each producing one feature map in the output image (which is a normal image).

The output is computed as follows:

where the *sum over* *dx,dy* is over the spatial filter kernel window defined by kernelWidth and kernelHeight, *sum over* *f* is over the input feature channel indices within group, *B* contains the binary weights, interpreted as `{-1, 1}` or `{0, 1}` and *scale\[c\]* is the `outputScaleTerms` array and bias is the `outputBiasTerms` array. Above *i* is the image index in batch the sum over input channels *f* runs through the group indices. The convolution operator âŠ— is defined by MPSCNNBinaryConvolutionType passed in at initialization time of the filter:

MPSCNNBinaryConvolutionType.binaryWeights  
The input image is not binarized at all and the convolution is computed interpreting the weights as `[0, 1] -> {-1, 1}` with the given scaling terms.

MPSCNNBinaryConvolutionType.XNOR  
The convolution is computed by first binarizing the input image using the sign function `bin(x) = x MPSCNNBinaryConvolutionType.AND  
The convolution is computed by first binarizing the input image using the sign function `bin(x) = x 

where *(dx,dy)* are summed over the convolution filter window.

where *in* is the original input image (in full precision) and *Nc* is the number of input channels in the input image. Parameter `beta` is not passed as input and to enable beta-scaling the user can provide MPSCNNBinaryConvolutionFlags.useBetaScaling in the flags parameter in the initialization functions.

Finally the normal activation neuron is applied and the result is written to the output image.

Note

`MPSCNNBinaryConvolution` does not currently support groups greater than 1.
