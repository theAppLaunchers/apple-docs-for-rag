## Overview

The Gaussian image pyramid kernel is enqueued as an in-place operation using the encode(commandBuffer:inPlaceTexture:fallbackCopyAllocator:) method. All mip-map levels (after level 1) present in the provided image are filled using the provided filter kernel. The `fallbackCopyAllocator` parameter is not used. The Gaussian image pyramid kernel ignores the clipRect and offset properties, and fills the entirety of the mip-map levels. Recall the size of the nth mip-map level as:

- `w_n = max(1, floor(w_0 / 2^n))`

- `h_n = max(1, floor(h_0 / 2^n))`

Where `w_0` and `h_0` are the width and height of the 0th level, respectively (i.e. the image dimensions themselves).

The Gaussian image pyramid is constructed as follows:

- First, the 0th level mip-map of the input image is filtered with the specified convolution kernel. The default convolution filter kernel is `k = ww^T`, where `w = [1/16, 1/4, 3/8, 1/4, 1/16 ]^T`. You may also modify this kernel with a `centerWeight` parameter of `a` resulting in `k = ww^T`, where `w = [(1/4 - a/2), 1/4, a, 1/4, (1/4 - a/2) ]^T`, or you may provide a completely custom kernel.

- Afterwards, the image is down-sampled by removing all odd rows and columns, which defines the next level in the Gaussian image pyramid.

- This procedure is continued until every mip-map level present in the image is filled with all the pyramid levels.

Note

Make sure your chosen texture type is compatible with mip-mapping and also supports texture views (i.e. the textureâ€™s usage includes the pixelFormatView option).
