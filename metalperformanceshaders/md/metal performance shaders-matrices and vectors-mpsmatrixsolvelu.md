``` source
class MPSMatrixSolveLU : MPSMatrixBinaryKernel
```

## Overview

This kernel finds the solution matrix to the system *op(A) \* X = B*, where:

- *op(A)* is *Aáµ€* or *A*

- *X* is the resulting matrix of solutions

- *B* is the array of right hand sides for which the equations are to be solved
