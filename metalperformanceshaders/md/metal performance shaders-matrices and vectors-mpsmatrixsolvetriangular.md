``` source
class MPSMatrixSolveTriangular : MPSMatrixBinaryKernel
```

## Overview

This kernel finds the solution matrix to the system *op(A) \* X = alpha \* B* or *X \* op(A) = alpha \* B*, where:

- A is either an upper or lower triangular matrix

- *op(A)* is either *Aáµ€* or *A*

- *X* is the resulting matrix of solutions

- *B* is the array of right hand sides for which the equations are to be solved
