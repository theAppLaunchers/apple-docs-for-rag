``` source
class MPSImageIntegral : MPSUnaryImageKernel
```

## Overview

The value at each position is the sum of all pixels in a source image rectangle, `sumRect. `Listing 1 shows the pseudocode used to calculate `sumRect`.

sumRect.origin = filter.offset
sumRect.size = dest_position - filter.clipRect.origin

Listing 1Â Pseudocode for sumRect

If the channels in the source image are normalized, half-float or floating values, the destination image is recommended to be a 32-bit floating-point image. If the channels in the source image are integer values, it is recommended that an appropriate 32-bit integer image destination format is used.
