## Overview

`MPSTemporaryImage` objects can provide a profound reduction in the aggregate texture memory and associated CPU-side allocation cost in your app. Metal Performance Shaders achieves this by automatically identifying `MPSTemporaryImage` objects that do not overlap in time over the course of a MTLCommandBuffer objectâ€™s lifetime and can therefore reuse the same memory. `MPSTemporaryImage` objects leverage an internal cache of preallocated reusable memory to hold pixel data to avoid typical memory allocation performance penalties common to ordinary MPSImage and MTLTexture objects.

To avoid data corruption due to aliasing, `MPSTemporaryImage` objects impose some important restrictions:

- The underlying texture storage mode is MTLStorageMode.private. You cannot, for example, use the getBytes(_:bytesPerRow:from:mipmapLevel:) or replace(region:mipmapLevel:withBytes:bytesPerRow:) methods with them. Temporary images are strictly read and written by the GPU.

- The temporary image may be used only on a single MTLCommandBuffer object. This limits the chronology to a single linear time stream.

- The readCount property must be managed correctly.

- Temporary images must also adhere to the general pixel format restrictions for MPSImage objects.

Since temporary images can only be used with a single command buffer, and can not be used off the GPU, they generally should not be kept around past the completion of their associated command buffer. The lifetime of a temporary image is typically expected to be extremely short, perhaps spanning only a few lines of code.

To keep the lifetime of the underlying texture allocation as short as possible, the texture is not allocated until the first time the `MPSTemporaryImage` object is used by an MPSCNNKernel object or until the first time the texture property is read. The readCount property serves to limit the lifetime of the texture on deallocation.

You may use the texture property with the `encode` methods of an MPSUnaryImageKernel subclass, if `featureChannelsreadCount property is not modified, since the enclosing object is not available. There is no locking mechanism provided to prevent a MTLTexture object returned from the texture property from becoming invalid when the value of the readCount property reaches 0.

`MPSTemporaryImage` objects can otherwise be used wherever MPSImage objects are used.

### The MPSTemporaryImage Class

The MPSTemporaryImage class extends the MPSImage class to provide advanced caching of unused memory, in order to increase performance and reduce memory footprint. MPSTemporaryImage objects are intended as fast GPU-only storage for intermediate image data needed only transiently within a single MTLCommandBuffer object. They accelerate the common case of image data which is created only to be consumed and destroyed immediately by the next operation(s) encoded in a command buffer. MPSTemporaryImage objects provide a convenient and simple way to save memory by automatically aliasing other MPSTemporaryImage objects in the same command buffer. Because they alias (i.e., share texel storage with) other textures in the same command buffer, the valid lifetime of the data in an MPSTemporaryImage object is extremely short, limited to a portion of a the command buffer itself.

You can not read or write data to an MPSTemporaryImage using the CPU, or use the data in other MTLCommandBuffer objects. Use regular MPSImage objects for more persistent storage.
