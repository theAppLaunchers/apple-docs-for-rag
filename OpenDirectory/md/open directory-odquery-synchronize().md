Instance Method

# synchronize()

Restarts a query, disposing of any results it has obtained.

Mac CatalystmacOS 10.6+

``` source
func synchronize()
```

## Discussion

If the query was originally scheduled in a run loop with schedule(in:forMode:), the delegate is called with `inResults` set to `nil`, `[inError code]` set to `kODErrorQuerySynchronize`, and `[inError domain]` set to `kODErrorDomainFramework`.
