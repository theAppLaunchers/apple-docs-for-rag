``` source
class ManagedAppConfigurationProvider
```

## Overview

This class provides objects of a type you define, which decodes and validates the configuration that the framework receives from the MDM server.

The framework ingests the configuration in the form of a property list that the MDM server provides and passes to your type as a Decoder. Your type conforms to Decodable and parses the configuration according to your specification that the server admin conforms to when creating the property list.

If the decoder encounters a problem, it throws an error that the MDM admin can find in the deviceâ€™s event log.
