Instance Method

# saveRecords

Saves records to the database.

CloudKit JS 1.0+

``` source
Promise saveRecords(
    CloudKit.Record|CloudKit.Record[] records,
 optional Object options
);
```

## Parameters 

`records`  

Possible values are:

| Type | Description |
|----|----|
| CloudKit.Record | A dictionary record to save. |
| `CloudKit.Record[]` | An array of records to save. |

`options`  

A dictionary containing options to use when saving records. Possible dictionary keys are:

| Key | Description |
|----|----|
| `zoneID` | A CloudKit.ZoneID or zone name (`String`) that identifies the record zone in the database where you want to perform the operation. The default is the database default zone. |
| `desiredKeys` | An array of strings containing record field names that limits the amount of data returned in this operation. Only the fields specified in the array are returned. The default is `null` which fetches all record fields. |
| `numbersAsStrings` | A Boolean value indicating whether number fields should be represented by strings. The default value is `false`. |

## Return Value

A `Promise` object that resolves to a CloudKit.RecordZonesResponse object, or if the operation fails, a CKError object.

## Discussion

Before saving records, create the record dictionaries with the appropriate key-value pairs. For `Asset` field types, provide a handler to upload the asset file separately. After fetching a record containing an `Asset` field type, you download the asset file separately.

Creating Records

Create a record represented by a CloudKit.Record dictionary. If you are creating a new record, the `recordType` is required. (If the record exists, the `recordChangeTag` key is required. ) If you omit the `recordName` key, the record is assigned a random UUID. Donâ€™t include the other keys in the CloudKit.Record dictionary when creating a record for the first time. This code fragment shows a new `Artwork` record:

```
var record = {
    recordName: '115',
    recordType: 'Artwork',
    fields: {
        title: {
            value: 'MacKerricher State Park'
        },
        address: {
            value: 'Fort Bragg, CA'
        }
    }
};
```

Saving Records

To get the record that was saved in the response, use the records property in the CloudKit.RecordsResponse class. Otherwise, handle any errors that occur appropriately.

```
database.saveRecords(record).then(function(response) {
    if (response.hasErrors) {
        var ckError = response.errors[0];
        // Insert error handling or throw the error and handle it using catch() later
        throw ckError;
    } else {
        // Insert successfully saved record code
        var record = response.records[0];
    }
});
```

Saving Records with Asset Fields

Use an `Asset` field type in your schema to store large data files separately from the associated record. In CloudKit JS, the value of an `Asset` field is an `Asset` dictionary, described in Asset Dictionary.

To save a record with an asset field, set a handler for uploading the asset file in HTML.

```

```

In JavaScript, implement the handler to save the record with the uploaded data. For example, save the `image` property (`Asset`) of an `Artwork` record.

```
function handleFileSelect(event) {
   var assetFile = event.target.files[0];
   database.saveRecords({
       recordType: 'Artwork',
       fields: {
           image: { value: assetFile }
       }
   }).then(function(response) {
       if (response.hasErrors) {
           // Insert error handling
           throw response.errors[0];
       } else {
           // Insert successfully saved record code
           var savedRecord = response.records[0];
       }
   });
}
```

In a record that is being saved to the database, the value of an `Asset` field must be a `window.Blob` type. In the code fragment above, the type of the `assetFile` variable is `window.File`.

Downloading Assets

To download an asset, use the `downloadURL` key in the returned or fetched `Asset` dictionary. The `downloadURL` key is included in the `Asset` dictionary in the response when you successfully save a record and later, when fetching a record.

```
var asset = record.fields[__'__image__'__];
var assetURL = asset.value.downloadURL;
```

The `downloadURL` contains a placeholder (`${f}`) for the filename. If you allow the user to download an asset to their computer, replace the placeholder with a filename.

```
assetURL.replace('${f}', 'image.png');
```
