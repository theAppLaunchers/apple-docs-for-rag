# CloudKit.RecordZoneNotification

A CloudKit.RecordZoneNotification object represents a push notification that was caused by changes to the contents of a record zone. A zone notification is triggered by subscriptions where the `subscriptionType` key is `zone`. Use a CloudKit.RecordZoneNotification object to get information about the record that changed. To create zone subscriptions and handle push notifications, see the saveSubscriptions method in CloudKit.Database.

CloudKit

Use the `CloudKit` namespace to configure CloudKit JS, and to access app containers and global constants.

CloudKit.CKError

A CloudKit.CKError object encapsulates an error that may occur when you use CloudKit JS. This includes CloudKit server errors and local errors.

CloudKit.Container

A CloudKit.Container object provides access to an app container, and through the app container, access to its databases. It also contains methods for authenticating and fetching users.

CloudKit.Database

A CloudKit.Database object represents a public or private database in an app container.

CloudKit.DatabaseChangesResponse

A CloudKit.DatabaseChangesResponse object encapsulates the results of fetching changed record zones in a database.

CloudKit.Notification

A CloudKit.Notification object represents a push notification that was sent to your app. Notifications are triggered by subscriptions that you save to the database. To subscribe to record changes and handle push notifications, see the `saveSubscription` method in CloudKit.Database.

CloudKit.QueryNotification

A CloudKit.QueryNotification object represents a push notification that was generated by a subscription object. A query notification is triggered by subscriptions where the `subscriptionType` key is `query`. Use a CloudKit.QueryNotification object to get information about the record that changed. To create query subscriptions and handle push notifications, see the saveSubscriptions method in CloudKit.Database.

CloudKit.QueryResponse

A CloudKit.QueryResponse object encapsulates the results of using a query to fetch records

CloudKit.RecordInfosResponse

A CloudKit.RecordInfosResponse object encapsulates the results of fetching information about records in general and shared records in particular.

CloudKit.RecordsBatchBuilder

A CloudKit.RecordsBatchBuilder object encapsulates the results of changes to multiple records in a single database operation.

CloudKit.RecordsResponse

A CloudKit.RecordsResponse object encapsulates the results of fetching records.

CloudKit.RecordZoneChangesResponse

The CloudKit.RecordZoneChangesResponse object encapsulates the results of fetching changes to one or more record zones.

CloudKit.RecordZonesResponse

A CloudKit.RecordZonesResponse object encapsulates the results of database operations on a record zone.

CloudKit.Response

The CloudKit.Response class is an abstract superclass for subclasses that encapsulate the response from server requests. Donâ€™t create instances of this class. Instances of subclasses are returned by methods in the CloudKit.Container and CloudKit.Database classes. Most of these methods return a `Promise` object that resolves to a subclass of CloudKit.Response if the operation is successful.

CloudKit.ShareRecordType

Display information about the record type of a shared record.
