# Promise

Represents an operation that hasnâ€™t completed yet, but is expected in the future.

CloudKit JS 1.0+

``` source
const Object Promise;
```

## Discussion

The asynchronous methods in CloudKit JS return a `Promise` object that resolves when the operation completes or is rejected due to an error. For a description of the `Promise` class returned by these methods, go to Mozilla Developer Network: Promise.
