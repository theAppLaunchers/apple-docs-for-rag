Protocol

# BEDragInteractionDelegate

A protocol to which the drag interaction delegates conform.

iOS 17.4+iPadOS 17.4+

``` source
@MainActor
protocol BEDragInteractionDelegate : UIDragInteractionDelegate
```

## Overview

Use BEDragInteraction and its delegate to asynchronously prepare drag interactions and add items to drag sessions, for example when supporting drag interaction requires Javascript execution. If you donâ€™t need to asynchronously interact with drag interactions, use UIDragInteraction instead.

## Topics

### Participating in drag gestures

func dragInteraction(BEDragInteraction, prepare: any UIDragSession, completion: () -> Bool)

Called when the drag interaction has begun, to allow the delegate to prepare for the drag session before the system requests drag items through `-dragInteraction:itemsForBeginningSession:`.

func dragInteraction(BEDragInteraction, itemsForAddingTo: any UIDragSession, forTouchAt: CGPoint, completion: ([UIDragItem]) -> Bool)

The asynchronous counterpart to `-dragInteraction:itemsForAddingToSession:withTouchAtPoint:` to allow touches on this view to add items to an existing drag session. Please refer to the aforementioned delegate method for its full documentation.
