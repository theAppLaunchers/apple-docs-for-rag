## Parameters 

`entry`  

The keyboard event delivered by the operating system.

`completionHandler`  

A block that you call to indicate whether your text view handled the event.

## Mentioned in 

Integrating custom browser text views with UIKit

## Overview

Implement this method to receive keyboard events from the operating system. If you handle the `entry` in code, call the completion handler with `true` as the second parameter. Otherwise, call the completion handler with `false` as the second argument, and call the delegateâ€™s shouldDeferEventHandlingToSystem(for:context:) method. In either case, pass the `entry` you received as the first parameter to the completion handler.

The operating system delivers events on a serial queue, so call the completion handler after your view processes an event to allow the operating system to send a subsequent event.
