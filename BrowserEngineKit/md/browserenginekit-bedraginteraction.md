## Overview

An interaction that enables your app to asynchronously provide drag items.

## Overview

`BEDragInteraction` is a subclass of UIDragInteraction that additionally supports asynchronous interaction.

When a person drags a UI element in your browser app, create a `BEDragInteraction` and attach it to the source view. When you create the object, set its delegate to an object that conforms to BEDragInteractionDelegate. Use the delegate to prepare the UIDragSession before the system requests drag items, which it does by calling the delegateâ€™s dragInteraction(_:itemsForBeginning:) method.

## Topics
