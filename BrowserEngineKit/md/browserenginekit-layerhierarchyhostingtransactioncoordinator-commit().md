Instance Method

# commit()

`commit` must be called on *every* instance and it must be the last call to each instance. note that it does not commit `CATransaction`s but rather commits the coordination of transactions in the render server. note that coordinators should have as constrained a lifespan as possible and will timeout if held open too long.

## Mentioned in 

Hosting browser view layers in the rendering extension

## Discussion

Notifies the render server to coordinate transactions for the added views and layer hierarchies.

## Overview

You need to add all relevant views and layer hierarchies to the transaction coordinator, share the coordinator between processes, and make all necessary transactions before you call this method. When you call `commit()`, you can no longer use the transaction coordinator.

You need to call `commit()` as the last action on the transaction coordinator in all processes that use the same transaction coordinator.

Note

Committing a transaction coordinator synchronizes changes committed in CATransaction objects that affect the added views and layer hierarchies, it doesnâ€™t commit the transactions. You call commit() on each relevant transaction.
