## Topics

### Creating a transaction coordinator

init() throws

may fail if a connection to the render server cannot be established

### Interprocess communication

init?(coder: NSCoder)

Creates a transaction coordinator from an encoded representation.

init(xpcRepresentation: xpc_object_t?) throws

Creates a transaction coordinator from an XPC object.

func createXPCRepresentation() -> xpc_object_t

Creates a representation of the transaction coordinator you send to another process.

### Synchronize transactions

func add(LayerHierarchyHostingView)

Notifies the transaction coordinator to start coordinating transactions for the given view.

func add(LayerHierarchy)

a signal to coordinate transactions involving `layerHierarchy` from now until `commit` is called

func commit()

`commit` must be called on *every* instance and it must be the last call to each instance. note that it does not commit `CATransaction`s but rather commits the coordination of transactions in the render server. note that coordinators should have as constrained a lifespan as possible and will timeout if held open too long.
