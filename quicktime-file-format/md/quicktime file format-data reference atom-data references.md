# Data references

An array of data references.

## Overview

Each data reference is formatted like an atom and contains the following data elements.

Size  
A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of bytes in the data reference.

Type  
A 32-bit integer that specifies the type of the data in the data reference. The table below lists valid data reference type values.

Version  
A 1-byte specification of the version of the data reference.

Flags  
A 3-byte space for data reference flags. There is one defined flag, `Self reference`, which indicates that the media’s data is in the same file as the movie atom. On the Macintosh, and other file systems with multi-fork files, set this flag to `1` even if the data resides in a different fork from the movie atom. This flag’s value is `0x0001`.

Data  
The data reference information.

The currently defined data reference types that can be stored in a header atom are as follows:

| Data reference type | Description |
|----|----|
| `'alis'` | Data reference is a Macintosh alias. An alias contains information about the file it refers to, including its full path name. |
| `'rsrc'` | Data reference is a Macintosh alias. Appended to the end of the alias is the resource type (stored as a 32-bit integer) and ID (stored as a 16-bit signed integer) to use within the specified file. This data reference type is deprecated in the QuickTime file format. This information documents existing content containing `'rsrc'` data references; don’t use it for new development. |
| `'url '` | A C string that specifies a URL. There may be additional data after the C string. |
