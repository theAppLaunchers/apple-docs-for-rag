# Metadata handling

Handling metadata in other file formats.

## Overview

This section describes how metadata is handled when QuickTime imports other file formats. For more information about metadata, refer to Metadata atoms and types and Compressed movie resources.

Each section includes a table with specific details on the following, where applicable:

- The format supported by QuickTime — for example, the movie import component or the graphics import component.

- The Macintosh file type — for example, `'Mp3 '`.

- File name extensions — for example, `.mp3`.

- Specific details for metadata handling — for example, all Microsoft-defined “tombstone” data is transferred to the imported movie’s user data. Metadata fields that have QuickTime equivalents are mapped as follows.

- Software required — for example, QuickTime 3 or later.
