# Including multiple closed-caption tracks

Include multiple closed-caption tracks in a movie.

## Overview

If a single closed caption track is included, it is recommended that the track be separate from any subtitle tracks in the movie. However, you can also include multiple closed-caption tracks in a movie. If you do, the following rules apply:

- The closed caption tracks must be part of the same alternate group. If the movie also includes subtitle tracks or non-chapter text tracks, those tracks should also be part of this group.

- The closed caption tracks should be tagged with the appropriate language.
