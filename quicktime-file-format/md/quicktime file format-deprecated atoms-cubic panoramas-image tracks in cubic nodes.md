# Image tracks in cubic nodes

Store cubic nodes that represent a panorama.

## Overview

For a cubic node the image track contains six samples that correspond to the six square faces of the cube. The same applies to hot spot and preview tracks. The following diagram shows how the order of samples in the track corresponds to the orientation of the cube faces.

Note that the frames are oriented horizontally. There is no provision for frames that are rotated 90 counterclockwise as there are for cylindrical panoramas.
