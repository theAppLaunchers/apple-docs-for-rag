# siDecompressionParam atom ('wave')

An atom that stores data specific to a given audio decompressor.

## Mentioned in 

Sound sample data

## Overview

The `siDecompressionParam` atom provides the ability to store data specific to a given audio decompressor in the `SoundDescription` record. As example, some audio decompression algorithms, such as Microsoftâ€™s ADPCM, require a set of out-of-band values to configure the decompressor. These are stored in an atom of this type.

This atom contains other atoms with audio decompressor settings and is a required extension to the sound sample description for MPEG-4 audio. A `'wave'` chunk for `'mp4a'` typically contains (in order) at least a `'frma'` atom, an `'mp4a'` atom, an `'esds'` atom, and a Terminator atom ('0x00000000').

The contents of other `siDecompressionParam` atoms are dependent on the audio decompressor.

## Topics

### Data fields

Size

An unsigned 32-bit integer holding the size of the decompression parameters atom.

Type

An unsigned 32-bit field.

Extension atoms

Atoms containing the necessary out-of-band decompression parameters for the sound decompressor.
