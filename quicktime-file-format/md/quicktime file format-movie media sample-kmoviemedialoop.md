Data field

# kMovieMediaLoop

An 8-byte unsigned integer that indicates how the embedded movie should loop.

## Overview

This atom is only used if the `TimeBase` of the embedded movie is not dependent on the container movie. If this atom contains a `0`, or if this atom is not present, the embedded movie will not loop. If this atom contains a value of `1`, the embedded movie loops normally â€” that is, when it reaches the end it loops back to the beginning. If this atom contains a value of `2`, the embedded movie uses palindromic looping. All other values are reserved.
