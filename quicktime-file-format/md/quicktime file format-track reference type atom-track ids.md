# Track IDs

A list of track ID values (32-bit integers) specifying the related tracks.

## Overview

Note that this is one case where track ID values can be set to `0`. Unused entries in the atom may have a track ID value of `0`. Setting the track ID to `0` may be more convenient than deleting the reference.
