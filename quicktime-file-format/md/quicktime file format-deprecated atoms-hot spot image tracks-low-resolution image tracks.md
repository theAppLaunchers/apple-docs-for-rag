# Low-resolution image tracks

Create low resolution image tracks for low memory conditions.

## Overview

Itâ€™s possible to store one or more low-resolution versions of a panoramic image in a movie file; those versions are called low-resolution image tracks. If there is not enough memory at runtime to use the normal image track, QuickTime VR uses a lower resolution image track if one is available. A low-resolution image track contains diced frames just like the higher resolution track, but the reconstructed panoramic image is half the height and half the width of the higher resolution image.

Important

The panoramic images in the lower resolution image tracks and the hot spot image tracks, if present, must have the same orientation (horizontal or vertical) as the panorama image track.
