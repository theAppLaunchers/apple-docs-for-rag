# Panorama tracks

A track that contains information about the panoramic nodes in a scene.

## Overview

Important

VR Media is deprecated in the QuickTime file format. The information that follows documents existing content containing VR Media and should not be used for new development.

A movieâ€™s panorama track is a track that contains information about the panoramic nodes in a scene. The media type of the panorama track is `'pano'`. Each sample in a panorama track corresponds to a single panoramic node. This sample parallels the corresponding sample in the QTVR track. Panorama tracks do not have a sample description (although QuickTime requires that you specify a placeholder sample description when you call `AddMediaSample` to add a sample to a panorama track). The sample itself contains an atom container that includes a panorama sample atom and other optional atoms.
