# URL hot spot atom

An atom that contains a URL string for a web location.

## Overview

Important

VR Media is deprecated in the QuickTime file format. The information that follows documents existing content containing VR Media and should not be used for new development.

The URL hot spot atom has an atom type of `kQTVRHotSpotURLType` (`'url '`). The URL hot spot atom contains a URL string for a particular Web location (for example, http://quicktimevr.apple.com). QuickTime VR automatically links to this URL when the hot spot is clicked.
