# Structure of an effect description

An effect description is the sole media sample for an effect track.

## Overview

An effect description is implemented as a `QTAtomContainer` structure, the general QuickTime structure for holding a set of QuickTime atoms. All effect descriptions must contain the set of required atoms, which specify attributes such as which effect component to use. In addition, effect descriptions can contain a variable number of parameter atoms, which hold the values of the parameters for the effect.

Each atom contains either data or a set of child atoms. If a parameter atom contains data, the data is the value of the parameter, and this value remains constant while the effect executes. If a parameter atom contains a set of child atoms, they typically contain a tween entry so the value of the parameter will be interpolated for the duration of the effect.

You assemble an effect description by adding the appropriate set of atoms to a `QTAtomContainer` structure.

You can find out what the appropriate atoms are by making an `ImageCodecGetParameterList` call to the effect component. This fills an atom container with a set of parameter description atoms. These atoms contain descriptions of the effect parameters, such as each parameterâ€™s atom type, data range, default value, and so on. The default value in each description atom is itself a `QTAtom` that can be inserted directly into your effect description.

You can modify the data in the parameter atoms directly, or let the user set them by calling `QTCreateStandardParameterDialog`, which returns a complete effect description (you need to add `kEffectSourceName` atoms for effects that require sources).

You then add the effect description to the media of the effect track.
