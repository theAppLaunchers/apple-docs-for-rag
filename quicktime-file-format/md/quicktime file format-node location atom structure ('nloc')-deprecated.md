# Node location atom structure ('nloc')

An atom that describes the type of a node and its location.

Deprecated

VR Media is deprecated in the QuickTime file format. The information that follows documents existing content containing VR Media and should not be used for new development.

## Overview

The node location atom is the only child atom defined for the node ID atom. Its atom type is `kQTVRNodeLocationAtomType` (`'nloc'`). A node location atom describes the type of a node and its location.

The structure of a node location atom is defined by the `QTVRNodeLocationAtom` data type:

```
typedef struct VRNodeLocationAtom {
    UInt16                              majorVersion;
    UInt16                              minorVersion;
    OSType                              nodeType;
    UInt32                              locationFlags;
    UInt32                              locationData;
    UInt32                              reserved1;
    UInt32                              reserved2;
} VRNodeLocationAtom, *QTVRNodeLocationAtomPtr;
