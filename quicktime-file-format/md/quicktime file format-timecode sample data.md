# Timecode sample data

An atom that represents timecode sample data.

## Overview

A timecode media sample is recorded as a 32-bit integer, interpreted based on the value of the Counter flag in the timecode sample description.

If the Counter flag is set to `1` in the timecode sample description, the sample data is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The timecode counter value is determined by dividing this unsigned 32-bit integer by the number of frames field in the timecode sample description.

If the Counter flag is set to `0` in the timecode sample description, the sample data format is a signed 32-bit integer and is used to calculate a timecode record.
