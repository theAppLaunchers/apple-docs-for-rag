# Track name atom ('tnam')

An atom that provides a name for a track.

## Overview

A movie atomâ€™s user data atom may contain a track name atom (`'tnam'`).

A track can have multiple `'tnam'` atoms with different language codes. Normally it is sufficient for each track to have a single `'tnam'` atom in the same language as the track content. Alternate tracks might also have `'tnam'` atoms; their presence implies only that the name is a good user-readable label for the track.
