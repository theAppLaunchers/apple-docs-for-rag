# Required atoms of an effects description

Specify the required atoms for your effects description.

## Overview

There are several required atoms that an effect description must contain. The first is the `kParameterWhatName` atom. The `kParameterWhatName` atom contains the name of the effect. This specifies which of the available effects to use.

The code snippet shown in the following listing adds a `kParameterWhatName` atom to the atom container `effectDescription`. The constant `kCrossFadeTransitionType` contains the name of the cross-fade effect.

```
effectCode = kCrossFadeTransitionType;
QTInsertChild(effectDescription, kParentAtomIsContainer,
                kParameterWhatName, kParameterWhatID, 0,
                sizeof(effectCode), &effectCode, nil);
```

In addition to the `kParameterWhatName` atom, the effect description for an effect that uses sources must contain one or more `kEffectSourceName` atoms. Each of these atoms contains the name of one of the effectâ€™s sources. An input map is used to map these names to the actual tracks of the movie that are the sources. Creating an input map describes how to create the input map.
