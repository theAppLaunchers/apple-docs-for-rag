# Edit atom ('edts')

An atom that defines the portions of the media that are to be used to build up a track for a movie.

## Overview

You use edit atoms to define the portions of the media that are to be used to build up a track for a movie. The edits themselves are contained in an edit list table, which consists of time offset and duration values for each segment. Edit atoms have an atom type value of `'edts'`.

In the absence of an edit list, the presentation of a track starts immediately. An empty edit is used to offset the start time of a track.

Note

If the edit atom or the edit list atom is missing, you can assume that the entire media is used by the track.

## Topics
