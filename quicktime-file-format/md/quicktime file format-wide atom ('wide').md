# Wide atom ('wide')

An atom that designates reserved space in the movie data file.

## Overview

A `wide` atom typically precedes a movie data atom. The `wide` atom consists only of a `type` and `size` field. This occupies 8 bytesâ€”enough space to add an extended size field to the header of the atom that follows, without displacing the contents of that atom. If an atom grows to exceed 2^32 bytes in size, and it is preceded by a `wide` atom, you may create a new atom header containing an extended size field by overwriting the existing atom header and the preceding `wide` atom.

## Topics
