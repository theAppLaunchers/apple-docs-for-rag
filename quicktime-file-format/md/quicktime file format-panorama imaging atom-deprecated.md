# Panorama imaging atom

An atom describes the default imaging characteristics for all the panoramic nodes in a scene.

VR Media is deprecated in the QuickTime file format. The information that follows documents existing content containing VR Media and should not be used for new development.

## Overview

A panorama-imaging atom describes the default imaging characteristics for all the panoramic nodes in a scene. This atom overrides QuickTime VRâ€™s own defaults.

The panorama-imaging atom has an atom type of `kQTVRPanoImagingAtomType` (`'impn'`). Generally, there is one panorama-imaging atom for each imaging mode, so the atom ID, while it must be unique for each atom, is ignored. QuickTime VR iterates through all the panorama-imaging atoms.

The structure of a panorama-imaging atom is defined by the `QTVRPanoImagingAtom` data type:

```
typedef struct QTVRPanoImagingAtom {
    UInt16                              majorVersion;
    UInt16                              minorVersion;
    UInt32                              imagingMode;
    UInt32                              imagingValidFlags;
    UInt32                              correction;
    UInt32                              quality;
    UInt32                              directDraw;
    UInt32                              imagingProperties[6];
    UInt32                              reserved1;
    UInt32                              reserved2;
} QTVRPanoImagingAtom, *VRPanoImagingAtomPtr;
```

The imagingValidFlags field in the panorama-imaging atom structure specifies which imaging property fields in that structure are valid. You can use these bit flags to specify a value for that field:

```
enum {
    kQTVRValidCorrection                        = 1 

**Constant descriptions**

`kQTVRValidCorrection`  
The default correction mode for panorama-imaging properties. If this bit is set, the correction field holds a default correction mode.

`kQTVRValidQuality`  
The default imaging quality for panorama-imaging properties. If this bit is set, the quality field holds a default imaging quality.

`kQTVRValidDirectDraw`  
The default direct-draw quality for panorama-imaging properties. If this bit is set, the directDraw field holds a default direct-drawing property.

`kQTVRValidFirstExtraProperty`  
The default imaging property for panorama-imaging properties. If this bit is set, the first element in the array in the imagingProperties field holds a default imaging property. As new imaging properties are added, they will be stored in this array.
