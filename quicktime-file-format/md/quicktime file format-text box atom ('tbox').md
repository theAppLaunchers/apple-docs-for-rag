# Text box atom ('tbox')

An atom that defines a text box for a subtitle sample.

## Overview

This optional extension defines a text box for a subtitle sample, to be used as described in Sample extensions. If present, this overrides the default text box in the associated sample description. If the subtitle sample descriptionâ€™s Display flags do not include the Vertical Placement flag (`0x20000000`), the Text Box atom should not be included in any sample of the subtitle track.
