# Bit rate atom ('btrt')

An atom that signals the bit rate information of a stream.

## Overview

The optional bit rate atom may be present at the end of any timed metadata sample description to signal the bit rate information of a stream. The bit rate information can be used for buffer configuration.

The layout of a bit rate atom is as follows:

| Data field | Bytes |
|----|----|
| Size | 4 |
| Type = `'btrt'` | 4 |
| Buffer size | 4 |
| Max bit rate | 4 |
| Average bit rate | 4 |

## Topics

### Data fields

Size

A 32-bit unsigned integer that indicates the size in bytes of the atom structure.

Type

A 32-bit unsigned integer value.

Buffer size

A 32-bit unsigned integer that indicates the suggested size of the associated data buffer.

Max bit rate

A 32-bit unsigned integer that indicates the maximum bit rate in bits/second of the associated media stream.

Average bit rate

A 32-bit unsigned integer that indicates the average bit rate in bits/second of the associated media stream.
