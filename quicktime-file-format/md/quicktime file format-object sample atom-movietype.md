Data field

# movieType

The movie controller type.

## Overview

The movieType field of the object sample atom structure specifies an object controller type, that is, the user interface to be used to manipulate the object.

QuickTime VR supports the following controller types:

```
enum ObjectUITypes {
    kGrabberScrollerUI                          = 1,
    kOldJoyStickUI                              = 2,
    kJoystickUI                                 = 3,
    kGrabberUI                                  = 4,
    kAbsoluteUI                                 = 5
};
```

**Constant Descriptions**

`kGrabberScrollerUI`  
The default controller, which displays a hand for dragging and rotation arrows when the cursor is along the edges of the object window.

`kOldJoyStickUI`  
A joystick controller, which displays a joystick-like interface for spinning the object. With this controller, the direction of panning is reversed from the direction of the grabber.

`kJoystickUI`  
A joystick controller, which displays a joystick-like interface for spinning the object. With this controller, the direction of panning is consistent with the direction of the grabber.

`kGrabberUI`  
A grabber-only interface, which displays a hand for dragging but does not display rotation arrows when the cursor is along the edges of the object window.

`kAbsoluteUI`  
An absolute controller, which displays a finger for pointing. The absolute controller switches views based on a row-and-column grid mapped into the object window.
