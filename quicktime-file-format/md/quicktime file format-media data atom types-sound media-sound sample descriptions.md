# Sound sample descriptions

A sound sample description contains information that defines how to interpret sound media data.

## Overview

The sound sample description contains information that defines how to interpret sound media data. This sample description is based on the standard sample description, as described in Sample description atom ('stsd').

The data format field contains the format of the audio data. This may specify a compression format or one of several uncompressed audio formats. The following table shows a list of some supported sound formats.

| Format | 4-character code | Description |
|----|----|----|
| Not specified | `0x00000000` | This format descriptor should not be used, but may be found in some files. Samples are assumed to be stored in either `'raw '` or `'twos'` format, depending on the sample size field in the sound description. |
| `kSoundNotCompressed` | `'NONE'` | This format descriptor should not be used, but may be found in some files. Samples are assumed to be stored in either `'raw '` or `'twos'` format, depending on the sample size field in the sound description. |
| `k8BitOffsetBinaryFormat` | `'raw '` | Samples are stored uncompressed, in offset-binary format (values range from `0` to `255`; `128` is silence). These are stored as 8-bit offset binaries. |
| `k16BitBigEndianFormat` | `'twos'` | Samples are stored uncompressed, in two’s-complement format (sample values range from `-128` to `127` for 8-bit audio, and `-32768` to `32767` for 1-bit audio; `0` is always silence). These samples are stored in 16-bit big-endian format. |
| `k16BitLittleEndianFormat` | `'sowt'` | 16-bit little-endian, twos-complement |
| `kMACE3Compression` | `'MAC3 '` | Samples have been compressed using MACE 3:1. (Obsolete.) |
| `kMACE6Compression` | `'MAC6 '` | Samples have been compressed using MACE 6:1. (Obsolete.) |
| `kIMACompression` | `'ima4'` | Samples have been compressed using IMA 4:1. |
| `kFloat32Format` | `'fl32'` | 32-bit floating point |
| `kFloat64Format` | `'fl64'` | 64-bit floating point |
| `k24BitFormat` | `'in24'` | 24-bit integer |
| `k32BitFormat` | `'in32'` | 32-bit integer |
| `kULawCompression` | `'ulaw'` | uLaw 2:1 |
| `kALawCompression` | `'alaw'` | uLaw 2:1 |
| `kMicrosoftADPCMFormat` | `0x6D730002` | Microsoft ADPCM-ACM code 2 |
| `kDVIIntelIMAFormat` | `0x6D730011` | DVI/Intel IMAADPCM-ACM code 17 |
| `kDVAudioFormat` | `'dvca'` | DV Audio |
| `kQDesignCompression` | `'QDMC'` | QDesign music |
| `kQDesign2Compression` | `'QDM2'` | QDesign music version 2 |
| `kQUALCOMMCompression` | `'Qclp'` | QUALCOMM PureVoice |
| `kMPEGLayer3Format` | `0x6D730055` | MPEG-1 layer 3, CBR only (pre-QT4.1) |
| `kFullMPEGLay3Format` | `'.mp3'` | MPEG-1 layer 3, CBR & VBR (QT4.1 and later) |
| `kMPEG4AudioFormat` | `'mp4a'` | MPEG-4, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) |
| `kAC3AudioFormat` | `'ac-3'` | Digital Audio Compression Standard (AC-3, Enhanced AC-3) |

## Topics

### Using sample descriptions

Sound sample description version 0 ('stsd')

A sound sample description that supports only uncompressed audio in raw or twos-complement format.

Sound sample description version 1 ('stsd')

An extended sound sample description that supports compressed audio, and includes the ability to add atoms to the sound description.

Sound sample description version 2 ('stsd')

An updated sound sample description that adds high resolution audio.
