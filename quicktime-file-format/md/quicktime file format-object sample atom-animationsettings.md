# animationSettings

A set of 32-bit flags that encode information about the animation settings of the object.

## Overview

The `animationSettings` field of the object sample atom is a long integer that specifies a set of animation settings for an object node. Animation settings specify characteristics of the movie while it is playing. Use these constants to specify animation settings:

```
enum QTVRAnimationSettings {
    kQTVRObjectAnimateViewFramesOn              = (1 

**Constant Descriptions**

`kQTVRObjectAnimateViewFramesOn`  
The animation setting to play all frames in the current view state.

`kQTVRObjectPalindromeViewFramesOn`  
The animation setting to play a back-and-forth animation of the frames of the current view state.

`kQTVRObjectStartFirstViewFrameOn`  
The animation setting to play the frame animation starting with the first frame in the view (that is, at the view start time).

`kQTVRObjectAnimateViewsOn`  
The animation setting to play all views of the current object in the default row of views.

`kQTVRObjectPalindromeViewsOn`  
The animation setting to play a back-and-forth animation of all views of the current object in the default row of views.

`kQTVRObjectSyncViewToFrameRate`  
The animation setting to synchronize the view animation to the frame animation and use the same options as for frame animation.

`kQTVRObjectDontLoopViewFramesOn`  
The animation setting to stop playing the frame animation in the current view at the end.
