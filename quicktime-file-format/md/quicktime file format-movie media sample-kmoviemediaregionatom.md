Data field

# kMovieMediaRegionAtom

A number of atoms, which describe how the Movie Media Handler should resize the embedded movie.

## Overview

If this atom is not present, the Movie Media Handler resizes the embedded movie to completely fill the containing trackâ€™s box.

`kMovieMediaSpatialAdjustment`  
This atom contains an OSType that indicates how the embedded movie should be scaled to fit the track box. If this atom is not present, the default value is kMovieMediaFitFill. These modes are all based on SMIL layout options.

`kMovieMediaFitClipIfNecessary`  
If the media is larger than the track box, it will be clipped; if it is smaller, any additional area will be transparent.

`kMovieMediaFitFill`  
The media will be scaled to completely fill the track box.

`kMovieMediaFitMeet`  
The media is proportionally scaled so that it is entirely visible in the track box and fills the largest area possible without changing the aspect ratio.

`kMovieMediaFitSlice`  
The media is scaled proportionally so that the smaller dimension is completely visible.

`kMovieMediaFitScroll`  
Not currently implemented. It currently has the same behavior as kMovieMediaFitClipIfNecessary. When implemented, it will have the behavior described in the SMIL specification for a scrolling layout element.
