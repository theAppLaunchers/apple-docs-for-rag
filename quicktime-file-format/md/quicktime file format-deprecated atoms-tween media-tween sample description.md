# Tween sample description

An atom that contains information for converting from media time to sample number to sample location for tweens.

## Overview

The tween sample description uses the standard sample description header, as described in Sample table atom ('stbl').

The data format field in the sample description is always set to `'twen'`. The tween media handler adds no additional fields to the sample description.
