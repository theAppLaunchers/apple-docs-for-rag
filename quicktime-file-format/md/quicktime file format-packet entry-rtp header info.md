Data field

# RTP header info

A 16-bit integer specifying various values to be set in the RTP header.

## Overview

The bits of the field are defined as follows.

| Bit | Value        |
|-----|--------------|
| 0   | reserved     |
| 1   | reserved     |
| 2   | P            |
| 3   | X            |
| 4   | reserved     |
| 5   | reserved     |
| 6   | reserved     |
| 7   | reserved     |
| 8   | M            |
| 9   | payload type |
| 0   | payload type |
| 1   | payload type |
| 2   | payload type |
| 3   | payload type |
| 4   | payload type |
| 5   | payload type |

The RTP header information field contains the elements as follows:

| Field | Bit# | Description |
|----|----|----|
| P | 2 | A 1-bit number corresponding to the padding (P) bit in the RTP header. This bit should probably not be set, since a server that needs different packet padding would need to unpad and repad the packet itself. |
| X | 3 | A 1-bit number corresponding to the extension (X) bit in the RTP header. This bit should probably not be set, since a server that needs to send its own RTP extension would either not be able to, or would be forced to replace any extensions from the hint track. |
| M | 8 | A 1-bit number corresponding to the marker (M) bit in the RTP header. |
| Payload type | 9-15 | A 7-bit number corresponding to the payload type (PT) field of the RTP header. |

All undefined bits are reserved and must be set to zero. Note that the location of the defined bits are in the same bit location as in the RTP header.
