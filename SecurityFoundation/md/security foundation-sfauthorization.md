# SFAuthorization

A class that allows you to restrict a userâ€™s access to particular features in your Mac app or daemon.

macOS 10.3+

``` source
class SFAuthorization
```

## Overview

Important

The authorization services API is not supported within an app sandbox because it allows privilege escalation.

The SFAuthorization class is an interface for some of the functions in the Authorization Services API. You can use the authorizationRef() method to obtain an authorization reference, used in other calls to Authorization Services functions. The Authorization Services API is documented in Authorization Services.
