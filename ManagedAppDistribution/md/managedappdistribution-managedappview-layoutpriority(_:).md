func layoutPriority(_ value: Double) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`value`  

The priority by which a parent layout apportions space to the child.

## Discussion

Views typically have a default priority of `0` which causes space to be apportioned evenly to all sibling views. Raising a viewâ€™s layout priority encourages the higher priority view to shrink later when the group is shrunk and stretch sooner when the group is stretched.

```
HStack {
    Text("This is a moderately long string.")
        .font(.largeTitle)
        .border(Color.gray)

    Spacer()

    Text("This is a higher priority string.")
        .font(.largeTitle)
        .layoutPriority(1)
        .border(Color.gray)
}
```

In the example above, the first `Text` element has the default priority `0` which causes its view to shrink dramatically due to the higher priority of the second `Text` element, even though all of their other attributes (font, font size and character count) are the same.

A parent layout offers the child views with the highest layout priority all the space offered to the parent minus the minimum space required for all its lower-priority children.
