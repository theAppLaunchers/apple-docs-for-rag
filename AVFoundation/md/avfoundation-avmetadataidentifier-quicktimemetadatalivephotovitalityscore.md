## Discussion

Live Photo movies may be algorithmically scored from `0.0` to `1.0` on their level of vitality. A Live Photo movie with a low vitality score offers little dynamism to the still photo it accompanies. The vitality score is normalized and independent of the vitality scoring version of the algorithm defined by quickTimeMetadataLivePhotoVitalityScoringVersion.

If a Live Photo movie contains the quickTimeMetadataAutoLivePhoto key and its value is nonzero, apps should read the quickTimeMetadataLivePhotoVitalityScore value and only display the movieâ€™s content if the score is `0.5` or higher.

If the capture session includes a metadata output configured to provide face, dog, or cat metadata objects, their presence greatly increases the vitality score.
