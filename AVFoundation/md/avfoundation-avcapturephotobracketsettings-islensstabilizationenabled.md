Capturing a Bracketed Photo Sequence

## Discussion

When this setting is true, the photo output uses optical image stabilization to hold the lens steady for the duration of the bracketed capture, helping to counter hand shake and produce a sharper bracket of images. The default setting is false.

You can enable this setting only if the photo outputâ€™s isLensStabilizationDuringBracketedCaptureSupported property is true. The capture output validates this requirement when you call the capturePhoto(with:delegate:) method. If your settings and delegate do not meet this requirement, that method raises an exception.
