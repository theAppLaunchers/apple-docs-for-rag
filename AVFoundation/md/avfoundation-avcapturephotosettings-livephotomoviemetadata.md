## Discussion

Live Photos capture both a still image and a short movie, which the system presents together in user interfaces such as the Photos app. A Live Photo movie always contains a `AVMetadataQuickTimeMetadataKeyContentIdentifier` key, associating the movie with a similar identifier in the kCGImagePropertyExifMakerNote property of the corresponding still image. The photo capture output automatically generates a unique content identifier for you if you donâ€™t specify one of your own. You can also use this property to specify additional movie metadata.

This property applies only if the value of the livePhotoMovieFileURL property is to non-`nil`.
