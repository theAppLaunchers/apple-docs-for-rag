Instance Property

# scaleFactor

Indicates the factor by which video buffers captured from the screen are to be scaled.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
var scaleFactor: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

By default, `AVCaptureScreenInput` captures the video buffers from the display at a scale factor of 1.0 (no scaling). Set this property to scale the buffers by a given factor; for example a 320x240 capture area with a scaleFactor of `2.0` produces video buffers at 640x480.
