``` source
var isHighPhotoQualitySupported: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

When this value is true, the format produces higher image quality when selecting a quality prioritization of AVCapturePhotoOutput.QualityPrioritization.balanced or AVCapturePhotoOutput.QualityPrioritization.quality in comparison to AVCapturePhotoOutput.QualityPrioritization.speed.

High-quality formats adhere to the following rules:

- Photo requests that prioritize speed produce the fastest image result, which makes it a good choice for burst captures.

- Photo requests that prioritize speed and quality equally produce higher image quality without dropping frames if a video recording is underway.

- Photo requests that prioritize quality produce high-quality images and may cause frame drops if a video recording is underway. For maximum backward compatibility, photo requests on high photo quality formats only cause video frame drops if your app links against iOS 15 or later.

Formats that donâ€™t support high photo quality produce the same image quality regardless of the current photoQualityPrioritization setting.
