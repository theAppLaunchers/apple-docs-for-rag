class AVURLAsset

An asset that represents media at a local or remote URL.

class AVAssetTrack

An object that models a track of media that an asset contains.

class AVAssetTrackSegment

An object that represents a time range segment of an asset track.

class AVAssetTrackGroup

A group of related tracks in an asset.

### Metadata

Retrieving media metadata

Load descriptive metadata for media assets and their tracks.

class AVMetadataItem

A metadata item for an audiovisual asset or one of its tracks.

class AVMutableMetadataItem

A mutable metadata item for an audiovisual asset or for one of its tracks.

struct AVMetadataIdentifier

A structure that defines identifiers for metadata formats.

struct AVMetadataKey

A structure that defines a metadata key.

struct AVMetadataKeySpace

struct AVMetadataExtraAttributeKey

A structure that defines keys for extra metadata attributes.

struct AVMetadataFormat

A structure that defines metadata formats.

class AVMetadataItemFilter

An object that filters selected information from a metadata item.

class AVPartialAsyncProperty

An asynchronous property that constrains its type.

class AVAnyAsyncProperty

### Fragmented assets

class AVFragmentedAsset

An asset with a duration that the system can extend without modifying its existing media data.

class AVFragmentedAssetTrack

An object that provides the track-level interface to inspect a fragmented assetâ€™s media tracks.

class AVFragmentedAssetMinder
