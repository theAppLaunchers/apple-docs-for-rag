var canPerformMultiplePassesOverSourceMediaData: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When the value for this property is true, the export session can produce higher quality results at the expense of longer export times. Setting this property to true may also require the export session to write temporary data to disk during the export. To control the location of temporary data, use the property directoryForTemporaryFiles.

The default value is false. Not all export session configurations can benefit from performing multiple passes over the source media. In these cases, setting this property to true has no effect.

You canâ€™t set this property after the export starts.
