## Discussion

The value indicated the time at which playback should end when the playback rate is negative (see `AVPlayer`â€™s rate property).

The default value is invalid, which indicates that no end time for reverse playback is specified. In this case, the effective end time for reverse playback is zero.

The value of this property has no effect on playback when the rate is positive.
