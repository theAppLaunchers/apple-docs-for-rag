``` source
func addControl(_ control: AVCaptureControl)
```

## Parameters 

`control`  

The capture control to add.

## Mentioned in 

Enhancing your app experience with the Camera Control

## Discussion

A capture session may not be able to add a control due to configuration reasons or limits of the host platform. Before calling this method, determine whether you can successfully add a control by calling the capture sessionâ€™s canAddControl(_:) method.

You may call this method while the session is running.

Important

For a control to become active, you must set a AVCaptureSessionControlsDelegate on the session.
