Capturing Uncompressed Image Data

## Discussion

If you requested photo capture in a RAW format, or in a processed format without compression such as TIFF, you can use this property to access the underlying sample buffer.

If you requested capture in a compressed format such as JPEG or HEVC/HEIF, this propertyâ€™s value is `nil`. Use the fileDataRepresentation() or cgImageRepresentation() method to obtain compressed image data.
