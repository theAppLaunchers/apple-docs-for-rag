Tracking Photo Capture Progress

## Discussion

Creating a AVCapturePhotoSettings instance automatically assigns a unique value to this property.

Use this property to track a photo capture request. After you call the capturePhoto(with:delegate:) method, the photo capture output calls your delegate object to provide information about the progress and results of the capture. Each delegate method includes a AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings whose uniqueID property matches the uniqueID value of the AVCapturePhotoSettings object you used to request capture.

It is illegal to reuse a AVCapturePhotoSettings instance for multiple captures. Calling the capturePhoto(with:delegate:) method throws an exception (invalidArgumentException) if the `settings` objectâ€™s uniqueID value matches that of any previously used settings object.
