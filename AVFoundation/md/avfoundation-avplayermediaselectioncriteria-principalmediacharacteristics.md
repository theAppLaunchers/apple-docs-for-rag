## Discussion

If no option matches the principal media characteristics, the system chooses the default option in the group as the best match.

When making automatic selections, a player item treats principal media characteristics as criteria that supersede language preferences and preferred media characteristics.

Important

Use principal media characteristics with caution. Itâ€™s typical to support accessibility features using a combination of language preferences and preferred characteristics, and not using principal media characteristics.
