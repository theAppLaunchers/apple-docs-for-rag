```

## Discussion

If the content length of the resource is unknown, the sum of the requestedLength and requestedOffset properties may be greater than the actual content length. When this situation occurs, an application must attempt to provide as much of the requested data beginning at the requestedOffset property as the resource contains. The application must then invoke either the AVAssetResourceLoadingRequest instanceâ€™s finishLoading() method upon success, or the finishLoading(with:) method if an error is encountered during the loading.
