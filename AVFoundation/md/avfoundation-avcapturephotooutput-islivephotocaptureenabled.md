## Discussion

This value defaults to false. Changing this value while your session is running requires a lengthy reconfiguration of the capture render pipeline. If you intend to take any Live Photo captures, set this value to true before calling AVCaptureSession startRunning(). If you change this property while the session is running, in-progress Live Photo captures end immediately, unfulfilled photo requests cancel, and the video preview temporarily freezes.

You must enable this option before initiating a photo capture with the livePhotoMovieFileURL property of your photo settings object set to non-`nil`. However, after youâ€™ve enabled this option, you can issue photo capture requests for both Live Photo captures and still photos.
