## Discussion

The default is true, which tells AV Foundation to embed the portrait effects matte images as HEIF and JPEG in the photo.

This property is ignored if isPortraitEffectsMatteDeliveryEnabled is set to false. AV Foundation includes the portrait effects matte only if both this property and isPortraitEffectsMatteDeliveryEnabled are set to true.
