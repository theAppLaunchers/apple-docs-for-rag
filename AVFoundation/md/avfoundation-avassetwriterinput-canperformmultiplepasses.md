## Discussion

When the value for this property is true, configure your source media data for random access. After appending the media data for the current pass, as specified by the currentPassDescription property, call markCurrentPassAsFinished() so the system can determine whether it needs to perform additional passes. The system may perform only the initial pass if it determines thereâ€™s no benefit to performing multiple passes.

When the value for this property is false, your source for media data only needs to support sequential access. In this case, append all of the source media one time and call markAsFinished().

The default value is false. Currently the only way for this property to become true is when the value of performsMultiPassEncodingIfSupported is true. The final value is available after you call startWriting().

This property is key-value observable.
