Instance Property

# allowsParallelizedExport

A Boolean value that indicates whether the session can parallelize its export operation.

macOS 14.0+

``` source
var allowsParallelizedExport: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

This value is true by default, which indicates that the export session is allowed to expedite its processing by using additional resources in parallel on select Mac systems. If parallelization isnâ€™t achievable, export proceeds as normal.

Note

Parallelized exports reduce the amount of time it takes to export media, but require additional power consumption. If your app requires opting out of the default behavior, set this value to false.
