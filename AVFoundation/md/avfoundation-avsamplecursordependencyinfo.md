## Topics

### Dependency Information

var sampleIndicatesWhetherItHasDependentSamples: ObjCBool

A Boolean value that determines whether the sample indicates if other samples depend on it.

var sampleHasDependentSamples: ObjCBool

A Boolean value that determines whether the sample has dependent samples.

var sampleIndicatesWhetherItDependsOnOthers: ObjCBool

A Boolean value that determines whether the sample indicates that it depends on other samples.

var sampleDependsOnOthers: ObjCBool

A Boolean value that determines whether the sample depends on other samples.

var sampleIndicatesWhetherItHasRedundantCoding: ObjCBool

A Boolean value that determines whether the sample indicates that it has redundant coding.

var sampleHasRedundantCoding: ObjCBool

A Boolean value that determines whether the sample has redundant coding.

### Initializers

init()

Creates a sample cursor dependency information structure.

init(sampleIndicatesWhetherItHasDependentSamples: ObjCBool, sampleHasDependentSamples: ObjCBool, sampleIndicatesWhetherItDependsOnOthers: ObjCBool, sampleDependsOnOthers: ObjCBool, sampleIndicatesWhetherItHasRedundantCoding: ObjCBool, sampleHasRedundantCoding: ObjCBool)

Creates a sample cursor dependency information structure with sample information.
