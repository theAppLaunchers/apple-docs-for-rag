## Discussion

When this value is nonzero, the player attempts to limit item playback by the specified bit rate when streaming over an expensive network, such as a cellular data plan. If the system canâ€™t reduce the bit rate to meet this value, it reduces it as much as possible while it continues to play the item.

Note

The value of the preferredPeakBitRate property applies unconditionally. This property value has no effect if this property value is less restrictive than the preferredPeakBitRate value.
