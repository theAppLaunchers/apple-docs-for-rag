## Discussion

The total duration of the samples in a chunk can be no greater than the preferred chunk duration, or the duration of a single sample if the single sampleâ€™s duration is greater than the preferred chunk duration. The default media chunk duration is `1.0` second. Setting a negative or non-numeric value for the chunk duration will cause an error.
