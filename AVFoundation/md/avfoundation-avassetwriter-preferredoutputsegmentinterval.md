Instance Property

# preferredOutputSegmentInterval

The interval of output segments that you prefer.

iOS 14.0+iPadOS 14.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+macOS 11.0+tvOS 14.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
var preferredOutputSegmentInterval: CMTime { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value is invalid, which indicates that the asset writer chooses an appropriate default value. You may also set a positive numeric or indefinite time. When the value is indefinite, each call you make to flushSegment() outputs a segment data.

You canâ€™t change this value after writing starts.
