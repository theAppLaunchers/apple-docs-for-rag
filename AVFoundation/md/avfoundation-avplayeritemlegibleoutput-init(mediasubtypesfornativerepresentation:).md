Initializer

# init(mediaSubtypesForNativeRepresentation:)

Creates an initialized legible-output object.

iOS 7.0+iPadOS 7.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.9+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
init(mediaSubtypesForNativeRepresentation subtypes: [NSNumber])
```

## Parameters 

`subtypes`  

An NSArray of NSNumber FourCC codes.

## Return Value

An initialized instance of `AVPlayerItemLegibleOutput`.

## Mentioned in 

init

## Discussion

When creating an instance you add media subtype FourCC codes as `NSNumber` objects to the `subtypes` array to elect to receive that type as a CMSampleBuffer instead of an attributed string. FourCC codes are converted to `NSNumber` objects as shown:

```
@[ [NSNumber numberWithUnsignedInt:'tx3g'] ]
```

Initializing an `AVPlayerItemLegibleOutput` using the `init` method (which is preferred) is equivalent to calling this method with an empty `subtypes` array, which means that all legible data, regardless of media subtype, is delivered using NSAttributedString instances in a common format.

If a media subtype for which there is no legible data in the current player item is included in the media `subtypes` array, no error occurs. An `AVPlayerItemLegibleOutput` instance doesnâ€™t vend closed caption data as a CMSampleBuffer, so it is an error to include `'c608'` in the media subtypes array.

Note

The preferred method of creating an `AVPlayerItemLegibleOutput` object is to use the init method.
