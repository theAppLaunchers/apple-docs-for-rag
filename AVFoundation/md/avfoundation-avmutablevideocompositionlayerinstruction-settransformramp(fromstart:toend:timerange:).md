Instance Method

# setTransformRamp(fromStart:toEnd:timeRange:)

Sets a transform ramp to apply during a given time range.

``` source
func setTransformRamp(
    fromStart startTransform: CGAffineTransform,
    toEnd endTransform: CGAffineTransform,
    timeRange: CMTimeRange
)
```

## Parameters 

`startTransform`  

The transform to be applied at the starting time of `timeRange`.

`endTransform`  

The transform to be applied at the end time of `timeRange`.

`timeRange`  

The time range over which the value of the transform is interpolated between `startTransform` and `endTransform`.

## Discussion

During a transform ramp, the affine transform is interpolated between the values set at the rampâ€™s start time and end time. Before the first specified time for which a transform is set, the affine transform is held constant at the value of CGAffineTransformIdentity; after the last time for which a transform is set, the affine transform is held constant at that last value.
