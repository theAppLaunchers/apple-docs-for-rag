# AVMutableCompositionTrack

A mutable track in a composition that you use to insert, remove, and scale track segments without affecting their low-level representation.

``` source
class AVMutableCompositionTrack
```

## Overview

Use this object to define constraints for the temporal arrangement of the track segments. If you set the compositionâ€™s track segments, you can test whether they meet the constraints by calling the validateSegments(_:) method.

## Topics

### Configuring Track Properties

var isEnabled: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the tracks is in an enabled state.

var naturalTimeScale: CMTimeScale

The time scale in which you can perform time-based operations without extra numerical conversion.

var languageCode: String?

The language associated with the track, as an ISO 639-2/T language code.

var extendedLanguageTag: String?

The language tag associated with the track, as an RFC 4646 language tag.

var preferredTransform: CGAffineTransform

The preferred transformation of the visual media data for display purposes.

var preferredVolume: Float

The volume the track prefers for its audible media data.

### Managing Time Ranges

var segments: [AVCompositionTrackSegment]!

The track segments that a composition track contains.

func insertEmptyTimeRange(CMTimeRange)

Adds or extends an empty time range within the track.

func insertTimeRange(CMTimeRange, of: AVAssetTrack, at: CMTime) throws

Inserts a time range of media from a source track into a composition track.

func insertTimeRanges([NSValue], of: [AVAssetTrack], at: CMTime) throws

Inserts the time ranges of multiple source tracks into a track of a composition.

func removeTimeRange(CMTimeRange)

Removes a time range of media from a composition track.

func scaleTimeRange(CMTimeRange, toDuration: CMTime)

Changes the duration of a time range of the track.

### Associating Tracks

func addTrackAssociation(to: AVCompositionTrack, type: AVAssetTrack.AssociationType)

Establishes a track association of a specific type between two tracks.

func removeTrackAssociation(to: AVCompositionTrack, type: AVAssetTrack.AssociationType)

Removes an association from a composition track.

### Replacing Format Descriptions

func replaceFormatDescription(CMFormatDescription, with: CMFormatDescription?)

Replaces a format description with another or cancels a previous replacement.

### Validating Segments

func validateSegments([AVCompositionTrackSegment]) throws

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether a given array of track segments conform to the timing rules for a composition track.
