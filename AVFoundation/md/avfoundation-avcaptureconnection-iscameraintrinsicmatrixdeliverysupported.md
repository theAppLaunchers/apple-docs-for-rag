## Discussion

A value of true means you can set isCameraIntrinsicMatrixDeliveryEnabled to true. The property is only true if both the connectionâ€™s input device format and output type support delivering camera intrinsics. In iOS 11, the AVCaptureVideoDataOutput class is the only output type that supports camera intrinsics.
