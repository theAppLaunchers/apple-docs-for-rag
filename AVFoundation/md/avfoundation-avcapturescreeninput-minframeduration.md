Instance Property

# minFrameDuration

The screen inputâ€™s minimum frame duration.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
var minFrameDuration: CMTime { get set }
```

## Discussion

The `minFrameDuration` is the reciprocal of its maximum frame rate.

You use this property to request a maximum frame rate at which the input produces video frames. The requested rate may not be achievable due to overall bandwidth, so actual frame rates may be lower.
