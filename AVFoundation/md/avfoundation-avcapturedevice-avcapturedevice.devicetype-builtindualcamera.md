## Mentioned in 

Capturing Photos with Depth

## Discussion

This device type supports the following features:

- Automatic switching from one camera to the other when the zoom factor, light level, and focus position allow.

- Higher-quality zoom for still captures by fusing images from both cameras.

- Depth data delivery by measuring the disparity of matched features between the wide and telephoto cameras.

- Delivery of photos from constituent devices (wide and telephoto cameras) from a single photo capture request.

It doesnâ€™t support the features below:

- Setting a AVCaptureDevice.ExposureMode.custom exposure mode or manual exposure bracketing.

- Locking focus with a lens position to a value other than currentLensPosition.

- Locking automatic white balance with device white balance gains other than currentWhiteBalanceGains.

Even when locked, exposure duration, ISO, aperture, white balance gains, or lens position may change when the device switches from one camera to the other. The overall exposure, white balance, and focus position however should be consistent.

You can only retrieve devices of this type using an AVCaptureDevice.DiscoverySession or by calling default(_:for:position:).
