# microphone

A microphone device type.

``` source
static let microphone: AVCaptureDevice.DeviceType
```

## Discussion

In iOS and tvOS, the system only exposes one capture device of this type. The audio routing subsystem decides which physical microphone to use, be it a built-in microphone, a wired headset, or an external microphone. The microphone deviceâ€™s localizedName changes as the audio subsystem switches to a different physical device.
