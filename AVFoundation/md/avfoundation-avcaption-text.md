## Discussion

Apple iTT format text supports the same Unicode code points that an XML document supports. The system converts XML special characters like ‘&’ to corresponding character-reference syntax when it writes the caption to a file. The text may contain the line-breaking character sequences LF, CR, or CF+LF.

CEA608 closed captions support the following Unicode characters. They don’t support the line-breaking character sequences LF, CR, or CF+LF.
