``` source
protocol AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate : NSObjectProtocol
```

## Overview

This protocol defines an interface for delegates of an AVCaptureVideoDataOutput object to receive captured video sample buffers and be notified of late sample buffers that were dropped.

The delegate of an AVCaptureVideoDataOutput object must adopt the `AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate` protocol. The methods in this protocol are optional.

## Topics

### Managing Sample Buffer Behavior

func captureOutput(AVCaptureOutput, didOutput: CMSampleBuffer, from: AVCaptureConnection)

Notifies the delegate that a new video frame was written.

func captureOutput(AVCaptureOutput, didDrop: CMSampleBuffer, from: AVCaptureConnection)

Notifies the delegate that a video frame was discarded.

var sampleBufferDelegate: (any AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate)?

The capture objectâ€™s delegate.

var sampleBufferCallbackQueue: dispatch_queue_t?
