```

## Discussion

The built-in triple camera supports the following features:

- Automatic switching from one camera to another when zoom factor, light level, and focus position allow.

- Delivery of photos from constituent devices (ultrawide angle, wide angle, and telephoto cameras) from a single photo capture request.

The built-in triple camera doesnâ€™t support the following features:

- AVCaptureDevice.ExposureMode.custom and manual exposure bracketing.

- Locking focus with a lens position other than currentLensPosition.

- Locking automatic white balance with device white balance gains other than currentWhiteBalanceGains.

Even when locked, exposure duration, ISO, aperture, white balance gains, or lens position may change when the device switches from one camera to another. However, the overall exposure, white balance, and focus position should be consistent.

Note

You can only discover this device type using an AVCaptureDevice.DiscoverySession or the AVCaptureDevice default(_:for:position:) method.
