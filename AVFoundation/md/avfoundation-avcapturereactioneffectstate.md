# AVCaptureReactionEffectState

An object that reports the state of a reaction effect performed on a capture device.

iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 17.0+

``` source
class AVCaptureReactionEffectState
```

## Overview

Obtain an instance of this class by querying a capture deviceâ€™s reactionEffectsInProgress property. The system adds new entries to this array when you call performEffect(for:) or by gesture detection in the capture stream when the value of reactionEffectGesturesEnabled is true.

The system renders the effect before providing frames to your app, and these status objects let you know when it performs the effect.

## Topics

### Configuring the effect state

var reactionType: AVCaptureReactionType

The type of reaction.

struct AVCaptureReactionType

Constants that indicate the type of reaction that an effect can perform.

var startTime: CMTime

The presentation time of the first frame where the system renders the effect.

var endTime: CMTime

The presentation time of the first frame following the end of a reaction effect.
