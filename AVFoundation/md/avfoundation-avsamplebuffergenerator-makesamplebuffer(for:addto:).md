Instance Method

# makeSampleBuffer(for:addTo:)

Creates a sample buffer and attempts to defer I/O for its data.

``` source
func makeSampleBuffer(
    for request: AVSampleBufferRequest,
    addTo batch: AVSampleBufferGeneratorBatch
) throws -> CMSampleBuffer
```

## Parameters 

`request`  

A sample buffer creation request.

`batch`  

A batch object to contain the output sample buffer. You must create this object by calling makeBatch() on the same instance of AVSampleBufferGenerator or an error occurs.

## Return Value

A sample buffer.

## Discussion

Call the makeDataReady(completionHandler:) on AVSampleBufferGeneratorBatch once to commence I/O and load sample data for all CMSampleBuffer objects in a batch. After loading commences, any subsequent calls to makeSampleBuffer(for:addTo:) throw an exception.

The generator may defer I/O to fetch sample data depending on the source of the sample data and the generatorâ€™s timebase

The request may fail based on generator configuration or file format.
