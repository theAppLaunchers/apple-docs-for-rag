init(asset: AVAsset) throws

Creates an object to read media data from an asset.

### Managing Outputs

func canAdd(AVAssetReaderOutput) -> Bool

Determines whether you can add the output to the asset reader.

func add(AVAssetReaderOutput)

Adds an output to the reader.

var outputs: [AVAssetReaderOutput]

The outputs from which you read media data.

### Configuring Reading

var timeRange: CMTimeRange

The time range within the asset to read.

var status: AVAssetReader.Status

The status of reading sample buffers from the asset.

enum Status

Values that represent the possible states of an asset reader.

var error: (any Error)?

An error that describes the reason for a failure.

### Controlling Reading

func startReading() -> Bool

Prepares the asset reader to start reading sample buffers from the asset.

func cancelReading()
