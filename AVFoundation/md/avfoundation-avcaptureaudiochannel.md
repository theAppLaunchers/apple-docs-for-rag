class AVCaptureAudioChannel
```

## Overview

You donâ€™t create instances of this class directly. Instead, an AVCaptureConnection object that connects an audio input to an audio output provides an array of AVCaptureAudioChannel objects, one for each channel of audio available. You can poll for audio levels by iterating through these audio channel objects.

## Topics
