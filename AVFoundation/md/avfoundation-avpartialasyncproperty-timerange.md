Type Property

# timeRange

The time range of the track within the overall timeline of the asset.

iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac CatalystmacOS 12.0+tvOS 15.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 8.0+

``` source
static var timeRange: AVAsyncProperty { get }
```

Available when `Root` inherits `AVAssetTrack`.

## Discussion

Use the load(_:) method to retrieve the property value.

If the start of the time range is greater than zero, the track doesnâ€™t initially have media data to present. This condition may occur when the media delays an audio track to align the start of audio with a specific video frame. You can test for this as the example below shows:

```
if track.timeRange.start > .zero {
    // Delayed start.
}
```
