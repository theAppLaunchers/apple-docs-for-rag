## Discussion

Enabling extended cinematic stabilization introduces longer latency into the video capture pipeline compared to AVCaptureVideoStabilizationMode.cinematic and consumes more memory, but yields improved stability.

Specify identical or similar minimum and maximum frame durations when using this mode.
