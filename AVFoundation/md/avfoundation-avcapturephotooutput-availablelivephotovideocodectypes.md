```

## Discussion

By default, Live Photo capture encodes the movie portion of a Live Photo using the H.264 codec. To use a different codec, set the livePhotoVideoCodecType property of your photo settings object to one of the values in this array.

The system always presents its default video codec first. If you havenâ€™t added the photo output to an AVCaptureSession with a video source, no codecs are available.

This property is key-value observable.
