Call this method if you cannot process the input image and wish to abort playback as a resultâ€”for example, if the outputImage object from your filter chain is nil. (If instead you want to fall back to rendering an unfiltered image, call the finish(with:context:) and pass the sourceImage object to the `filteredImage` parameter.)

Calling this method causes AVFoundation to post a notification named failedToPlayToEndTimeNotification. Observers of this notification can use the AVPlayerItemFailedToPlayToEndTimeErrorKey key to examine the error you provide.
