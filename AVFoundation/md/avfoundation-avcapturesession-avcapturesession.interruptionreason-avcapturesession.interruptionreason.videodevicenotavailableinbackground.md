# AVCaptureSession.InterruptionReason.videoDeviceNotAvailableInBackground

An interruption caused by the app being sent to the background while using a camera.

iOS 9.0+iPadOS 9.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+tvOS 17.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
case videoDeviceNotAvailableInBackground
```

## Discussion

Camera usage is prohibited while in the background. If you attempt to start running a camera while in the background, the capture session sends an wasInterruptedNotification with this interruption reason. If you donâ€™t explicitly call the stopRunning() method, your startRunning() request is preserved, and when your app comes back to foreground, you receive interruptionEndedNotification and your session starts running.
