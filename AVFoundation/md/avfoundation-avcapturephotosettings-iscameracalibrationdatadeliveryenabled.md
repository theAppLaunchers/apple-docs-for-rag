Instance Property

# isCameraCalibrationDataDeliveryEnabled

A Boolean value that determines whether a dual photo capture also delivers camera calibration data.

``` source
var isCameraCalibrationDataDeliveryEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When this setting is false (the default), and the isDualCameraDualPhotoDeliveryEnabled setting is true, dual photo capture doesnâ€™t deliver additional data.

If you change this setting to true, the AVCapturePhoto results from a dual photo capture include AVCameraCalibrationData objects that describe the imaging parameters for each camera. This data can be useful for performing computer vision tasks on the resulting images.
