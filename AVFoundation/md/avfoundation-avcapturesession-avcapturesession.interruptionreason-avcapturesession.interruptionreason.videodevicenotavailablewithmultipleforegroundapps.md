## Discussion

If your capture session configuration disallows accessing the camera while multitasking, the system interrupts it with this reason when a user switches to a multitasking mode like Split View. The system doesnâ€™t interrupt your capture session with this reason if isMultitaskingCameraAccessEnabled is true.
