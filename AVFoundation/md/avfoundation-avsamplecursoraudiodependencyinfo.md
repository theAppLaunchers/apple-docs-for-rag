### Querying Independent Decodability

var audioSampleIsIndependentlyDecodable: ObjCBool

A Boolean value indicating whether the sample is independently decodable.

var audioSamplePacketRefreshCount: Int

The number of samples, starting at the current sample, that must be fed to the decoder to achieve full decoder refresh.

### Initializers

init()

Creates an audio sample decodability information structure.

init(audioSampleIsIndependentlyDecodable: ObjCBool, audioSamplePacketRefreshCount: Int)

Creates an audio sample decodability information structure with the specified values.
