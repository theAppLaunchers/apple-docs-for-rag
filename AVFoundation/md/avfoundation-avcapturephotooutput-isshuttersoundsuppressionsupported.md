## Discussion

In iOS, the value is true, except in jurisdictions where you canâ€™t disable the shutter sound. On all other platforms, the value is always false.

If the output supports this feature, you can supress the shutter sound when capturing a photo using the isShutterSoundSuppressionEnabled property of AVCapturePhotoSettings.
