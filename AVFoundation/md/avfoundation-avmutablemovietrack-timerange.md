Instance Property

# timeRange

The time range of the track within the overall timeline of the asset.

iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.11+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 6.0+

``` source
var timeRange: CMTimeRange { get }
```

## Discussion

If the start of the time range is greater than zero, the track doesnâ€™t initially have media data to present. This condition may occur when the media delays an audio track to align the start of audio with a specific video frame. You can test for this as the example below shows:

```
if track.timeRange.start > .zero {
    // Delayed start.
}
```
