``` source
var producesCombinableFragments: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value is false. Set the value to true when you use multiple asset writers to produce distinct streams that complement each other, such as HLS encodings or bit rate variants.

You canâ€™t set this property after writing starts.
