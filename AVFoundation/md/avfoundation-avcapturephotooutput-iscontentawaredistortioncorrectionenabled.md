``` source
var isContentAwareDistortionCorrectionEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

You can set this value to true only if isContentAwareDistortionCorrectionSupported returns true.

Applying distortion correction to preserve natural-looking content may result in a small change in the field of view compared to what you see in AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer. The amount lost or gained is content specific and varies from photo to photo.

Enabling this property requires a lengthy reconfiguration of the capture render pipeline, so set this property to true before calling startRunning() on the capture session.
