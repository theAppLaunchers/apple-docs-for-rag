## Mentioned in 

Capturing Photos with Depth

## Discussion

To request capture of depth data alongside a photo (on supported devices), set the isDepthDataDeliveryEnabled property of your photo settings object to true when requesting photo capture. If you did not request depth data delivery, this propertyâ€™s value is `nil`.

Note

If you set the embedsDepthDataInPhoto property of your photo object to false when requesting photo capture, this property still provides depth data, but that data is not included when generating photo file data for output.
