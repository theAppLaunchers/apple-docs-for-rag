``` source
weak var delegate: (any AVPlayerItemLegibleOutputPushDelegate)? { get }
```

## Discussion

Because the delegate is held using a zeroing-weak reference, this property has a value of `nil` after a delegate that was previously set has been deallocated.

This property does not support key-value observing.
