## Discussion

If you requested a preview image by specifying the previewPhotoFormat property of your photo settings when requesting capture, this property offers access to the resulting preview image pixel data. The pixel buffer contains only the minimal attachments required for correct display. If you did not request a preview image, this propertyâ€™s value is `nil`.
