## Discussion

When using a virtual capture device, the system can fuse the images from its constituent cameras to improve image quality.

If the current configuration doesnâ€™t support virtual device fusion, your capture requests always resolve isVirtualDeviceFusionEnabled to false.

This property is key-value observable.
