## Discussion

This property specifies the current red, green, and blue gain values derived from the current scene to deliver a neutral (or gray world) white point for white balance.

Gray world values assume youâ€™ve placed a neutral subject (for example, a gray card) in the middle of the subject area, and fills the center 50% of the frame. Apps can read these values and apply them to the device using setWhiteBalanceModeLocked(with:completionHandler:).

Each change supports values between `1.0` and maxWhiteBalanceGain. You can read the value at any time, regardless of white balance mode.

This property is key-value observable.
