## Discussion

The value of this property defaults to true for devices that support autoexposure. If your app requires explicitly setting the state of isFaceDrivenAutoExposureEnabled, set this value to false.

To set this property value, you must call the deviceâ€™s lockForConfiguration() method to obtain exclusive access to configure it. Otherwise, attempting to set a value raises an exception. When you finish configuring the device, call unlockForConfiguration() to release the lock.
