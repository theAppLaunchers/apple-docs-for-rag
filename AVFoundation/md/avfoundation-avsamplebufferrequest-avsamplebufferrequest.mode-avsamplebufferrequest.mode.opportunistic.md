## Discussion

In situations with multiple competing requests, a sample buffer generator may defer an opportunistic request in favor of another immediate request, or a scheduled requests with a presentation time close to the timebase time.

Important

The system may postpone an opportunistic request indefinitely. Donâ€™t use this mode for time-sensitive processing.
