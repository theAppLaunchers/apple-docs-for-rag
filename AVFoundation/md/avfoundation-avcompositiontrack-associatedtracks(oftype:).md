``` source
func associatedTracks(ofType trackAssociationType: AVAssetTrack.AssociationType) -> [AVAssetTrack]
```

## Parameters 

`trackAssociationType`  

The requested track association type.

## Return Value

An array of tracks matching the specified track association type, or an empty array if none are found.

## Discussion

Apple discourages using this method in iOS 15, tvOS 15, macOS 12, and watchOS 8 or later. Load associated tracks asynchronously using loadAssociatedTracks(ofType:completionHandler:) instead.

You can call this method without blocking the current thread after youâ€™ve loaded the availableTrackAssociationTypes property.
