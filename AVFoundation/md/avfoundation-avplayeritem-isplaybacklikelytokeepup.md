## Discussion

This property communicates a prediction of playability. Factors considered in this prediction include I/O throughput and media decode performance. It is possible for `playbackLikelyToKeepUp` to indicate false while the property isPlaybackBufferFull indicates true. In this event the playback buffer has reached capacity but there isnâ€™t the statistical data to support a prediction that playback is likely to keep up in the future. It is up to you to decide whether to continue media playback.
