## Discussion

Some system user interfaces, like the macOS Video Effects Menu, display a video zoom factor value in a way most appropriate for visual presentation, which might differ from the videoZoomFactor property value.

Your app can key-value observe this property to update the display video zoom factor values in its user interface to stay consistent with Appleâ€™s system UIs.
