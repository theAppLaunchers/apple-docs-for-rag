## Discussion

The total size of the samples in a chunk can be no greater than the preferred chunk size, or the size of a single sample if the single sampleâ€™s size is greater than the preferred chunk size. The default media chunk duration is `1024 * 1024` bytes. Setting a negative value for the chunk duration will cause an error.

A larger chunk size can result in fewer reads from the storage container, at the potential expense of a larger memory footprint.
