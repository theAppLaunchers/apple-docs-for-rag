## Discussion

The property only applies to a video connection. You can set this property to a value in the range `[1.0,` \`\`AVCaptureConnection/videoMaxScaleAndCropFactor\`\`\`\]`. A factor of `1.0\` keeps the image at its original. Factors greater than \`1.0\` scale the image up and center-crop the image to its original dimensions.
