``` source
nonisolated
func playImmediately(atRate rate: Float)
```

## Parameters 

`rate`  

The specified playback rate.

## Discussion

This method plays the available media data at the specified `rate` regardless of whether there is sufficient media buffered to ensure smooth playback. If media data exists in the playback buffer, calling this method changes the playerâ€™s playback rate to the specified `rate` and its timeControlStatus to a value of AVPlayer.TimeControlStatus.playing. If the player has insufficient media data buffered to begin playback, the player will behave as if it has encountered a stall during playback, except that no playbackStalledNotification will be posted.
