## Discussion

The default value is false. Most QuickTime movie files contain all of the media data they require, but some contain references to media stored in other files. While AVFoundation and CoreMedia typically use a URL reference for this purpose, older implementations such as QuickTime 7 have commonly used a Macintosh alias instead, as documented in the QuickTime File Format specification. If your app must work with legacy QuickTime movie files containing alias-based references to media data stored in other files, set this value to true.

If you provide a value for AVMovieReferenceRestrictionsKey, the movie observes these restrictions for resolved alias references just as theyâ€™re for URL references.
