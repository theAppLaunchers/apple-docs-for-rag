Instance Property

# isAutoVirtualDeviceFusionEnabled

A Boolean value that specifies whether to use automatic virtual-device image fusion.

``` source
var isAutoVirtualDeviceFusionEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When isAutoVirtualDeviceFusionEnabled and isVirtualDeviceFusionSupported are true, the framework may fuse constituent camera images of a virtual device to improve still image quality, depending on the current zoom factor, light levels, and focus position. You can determine whether virtual device fusion is enabled for a particular capture request by inspecting the isVirtualDeviceFusionEnabled property of AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings.

The default value for this property is true, unless youâ€™re capturing a RAW photo or a bracket using AVCapturePhotoBracketSettings.

Note

When using the deprecated AVCaptureStillImageOutput interface with a virtual device, isAutoVirtualDeviceFusionEnabled is always enabled, if supported.
