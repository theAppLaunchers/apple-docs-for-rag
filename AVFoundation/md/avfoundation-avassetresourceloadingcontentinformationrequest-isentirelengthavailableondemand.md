## Discussion

Before you finish loading an AVAssetResourceLoadingRequest, if its contentInformationRequest isnâ€™t `nil`, set the value to true to indicate that all asset data is available. This may be true because the data is fully cached, or because the custom URL scheme ultimately refers to files on local storage, which allows for significant data flow optimizations.

For backward compatibility, this property defaults to false.
