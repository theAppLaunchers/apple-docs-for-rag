## Discussion

Set `preferredPeakBitRate` to nonzero to indicate that the player should attempt to limit item playback to that bit rate, expressed in bits per second.

If the system canâ€™t lower network bandwidth consumption to meet the this value, it reduces it as much as possible while it continues to play the item.
