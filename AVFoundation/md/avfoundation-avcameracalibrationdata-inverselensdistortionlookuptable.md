## Discussion

If youâ€™ve rectified an image by removing the distortions characterized by the lensDistortionLookupTable property, and now wish to go back to a geometrically distorted image (for example, to render visual effects into the camera image or perform computer vision tasks such as scene reconstruction), use this inverse lookup table.
