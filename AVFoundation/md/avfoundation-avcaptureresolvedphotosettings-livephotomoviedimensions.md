## Discussion

Use the livePhotoMovieFileURL property in your photo settings object to request Live Photo capture. Live Photo movie dimensions can change depending on which device camera is used for capture.

This property provides dimensions for the movie content of the Live Photo, which is delivered in the photoOutput(_:didFinishProcessingLivePhotoToMovieFileAt:duration:photoDisplayTime:resolvedSettings:error:) method. Use this property in earlier delegate methods to find the dimensions of the movie before delivery.

For the dimensions of the static photo content of a Live Photo, see the photoDimensions property.

If you do not request Live Photo capture, this propertyâ€™s value has zero width and zero height.
