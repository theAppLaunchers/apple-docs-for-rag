## Discussion

Cinematic video stabilization has a reduced field of view compared to standard video stabilization. Enabling cinematic video stabilization introduces considerably more latency into the video capture pipeline than standard video stabilization and consumes significantly more system memory.

Specify identical or similar minimum and maximum frame durations when using this mode.
