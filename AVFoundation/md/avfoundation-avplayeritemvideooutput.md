init(outputSettings: [String : Any]?)

Creates a video output object initialized with the specified output settings.

### Configuring the Delegate

func setDelegate((any AVPlayerItemOutputPullDelegate)?, queue: dispatch_queue_t?)

Sets the delegate and dispatch queue for the receiver.

var delegate: (any AVPlayerItemOutputPullDelegate)?

The delegate for the video output object.

protocol AVPlayerItemOutputPullDelegate

Methods you can implement to respond to pixel buffer changes.

var delegateQueue: dispatch_queue_t?

The dispatch queue on which to call delegate methods.

### Notifying the Delegate of Changes

func requestNotificationOfMediaDataChange(withAdvanceInterval: TimeInterval)

Tells the receiver that the video out put client is entering a quiescent state.

### Getting Pixel Buffer Data

func hasNewPixelBuffer(forItemTime: CMTime) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether video output is available for the specified item time.

func copyPixelBuffer(forItemTime: CMTime, itemTimeForDisplay: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;CMTime>?) -> CVPixelBuffer?
