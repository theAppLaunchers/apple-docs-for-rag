Instance Method

# performEffect(for:)

Performs the specified reaction type on the video stream.

iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 17.0+

``` source
func performEffect(for reactionType: AVCaptureReactionType)
```

## Parameters 

`reactionType`  

A reaction type to perform. Specifying a type that doesnâ€™t exists within the set of availableReactionTypes for the device results in an exception.

## Discussion

The entries in the reactionEffectsInProgress property may not reflect one-to-one with calls to this method. Depending on reaction style or resource limits, the system may coalesce overlapping reactions of the same type by extending an existing reaction rather than overlaying a new one.

Note

Calling this method has no effect when the value of canPerformReactionEffects is false. In this case, VoIP apps should transmit and display reactions outside of the video feed.
