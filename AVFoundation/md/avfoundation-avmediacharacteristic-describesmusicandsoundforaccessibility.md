## Discussion

Legible media options may include transcriptions of spoken dialog and descriptions of music and sound effects.

The value of this characteristic is `public.accessibility.describes-music-and-sound`.

For QuickTime movies and `.m4v` files, a media option has this characteristic only if the mediaâ€™s author tags it that way.
