## Discussion

As a rule, capture formats with a given mediaType are available for use with all AVCaptureOutput subclasses that accept that media type. However, this isnâ€™t always the case. For example, formats for high-resolution photo capture may not support the AVCaptureMovieFileOutput class due to bandwidth limitations.
