``` source
class var isCenterStageEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

You can only set this value when Center Stage is under app or cooperative control. Attempting to change the enabled state when the control mode is AVCaptureDevice.CenterStageControlMode.user, results in the system throwing an exception.

Note

When Center Stage is under user or cooperative control, the user may change the featureâ€™s enabled state in Control Center. Key-value observe this property value to monitor these changes.
