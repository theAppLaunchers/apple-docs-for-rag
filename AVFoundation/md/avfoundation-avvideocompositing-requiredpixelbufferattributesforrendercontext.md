Instance Property

# requiredPixelBufferAttributesForRenderContext

The pixel buffer attributes that the compositor requires for pixel buffers that it creates.

iOS 7.0+iPadOS 7.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.9+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
var requiredPixelBufferAttributesForRenderContext: [String : any Sendable] { get }
```

**Required**

## Discussion

The property is required to provide a kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey key in the dictionary, along with attributes for which the compositor needs specific values to work properly. Omitted attributes will be supplied by the composition engine to allow for the best performance. If the attribute kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey key is not in the dictionary an exception will be raised. The value of the kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey is an array of `kCVPixelFormatType_*` constants as defined in Pixel_Format_Types.

The value of `requiredPixelBufferAttributesForRenderContext` is retrieved prior to the creation of a new render context; the combination of the attributes in the returned value and the additional attributes supplied by the composition engine will be used in the creation of subsequent render contextâ€™s pixelBuffers.

This property is queried once before any composition request is sent to the compositor. Changing required buffer attributes afterwards is not supported.
