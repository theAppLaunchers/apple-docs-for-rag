func nw_framer_create_definition(

    _ start_handler: @escaping nw_framer_start_handler_t
) -> nw_protocol_definition_t
```

## Discussion

Each time you initialize a protocol definition with your custom start handler, a new definition is created that will not be considered equal to other definitions. If you need to associate messages with a protocol you have added to a connectionâ€™s protocol stack, make sure to use the same definition.
