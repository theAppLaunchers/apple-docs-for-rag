## Overview

This TicTacToe sample code project creates a networked game that you can play between different devices, communicating with a custom protocol. The game offers two ways to play:

- On Apple TV, the game uses DeviceDiscoveryUI to discover nearby iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS devices. After connecting, you can use your device to play against an AI opponent on Apple TV.

- On iOS and iPadOS devices, the game uses Bonjour and TLS to establish secure connections between nearby devices. You can use this mode to play a peer-to-peer two-player game.
