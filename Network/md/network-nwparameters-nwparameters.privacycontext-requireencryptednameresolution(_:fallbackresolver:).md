``` source
func requireEncryptedNameResolution(
    _ requireEncryption: Bool,
    fallbackResolver: NWParameters.PrivacyContext.ResolverConfiguration?
)
```

## Parameters 

`requireEncryption`  

A Boolean that indicates whether your connections prohibits unencrypted name resolution.

`fallbackResolver`  

An encrypted DNS resolver configuration that your connections use if the system doesnâ€™t have a preferred encrypted resolver.

## Discussion

Connections that use iCloud Private Relay automatically use encrypted name resolution. When active, name resolution uses iCloud Private Relay instead of the `fallbackResolver`.
