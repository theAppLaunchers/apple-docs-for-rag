## Discussion

IOReportCategories is the type for the .categories field of IOReportChanelType. These categories are inteded to empower a limited number of clients to retrieve a broad range of channels without knowing much about them. They can be ORâ€™d together as needed. Groups and subgroups are a more extensible mechanism for aggregating channels produced by different drivers.
