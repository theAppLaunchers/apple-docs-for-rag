## Overview

An IOTimerDispatchSource object executes an associated action at a designated time. After configuring the dispatch source object, call the WakeAtTime method to schedule the time at which to execute your code. There are several timebases you can use to configure the timer, but the most common one is kIOTimerClockMachAbsoluteTime.
