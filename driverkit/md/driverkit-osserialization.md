## Overview

OSSerialization provides methods to serialize an object to binary data suitable for messaging. Only certain DriverKit classes may be serialized: OSData, OSString, OSNumber, OSBoolean, OSArray, OSDictionary.

OSSerialization provides no concurrency protection; itâ€™s up to the usage context to provide any protection necessary.
