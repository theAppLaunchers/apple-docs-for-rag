``` source
kern_return_t EnqueueWithCoalesce(uint32_t dataSize, bool * sendDataAvailable, IODataQueueClientEnqueueEntryBlockcallback);
```

## Parameters 

`dataSize`  

The size of the data to enqueue.

`sendDataAvailable`  

A Boolean value that indicates that this method would have sent a notification. Initialize the value to `false`, and then make one or more calls to this method. If the value is `true` after all of those calls, call the SendDataAvailable method yourself to deliver the notification.

`callback`  

The callback to execute when there is enough space to enqueue the data.

## Return Value

kIOReturnSuccess on success, kIOReturnOverrun if the queue was full, or kIOReturnError if the queue is corrupt. See Error Codes.
