void * GetReference();
```

A pointer to the additional storage you requested at creation time. This method returns `NULL` if you passed `0` to the `referenceSize` parameter of the Create method. It also returns `NULL` if the action object doesnâ€™t belong to the current process.

## Discussion

The action object zero-initializes the memory it allocates. Only the process that owns the action object may access the memory.
