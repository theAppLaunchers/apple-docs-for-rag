class IOUserClient;

## Overview

An application may open an IOUserClient by calling IOServiceOpen(). This results in a call to the IOService::NewUserClient API to create an instance representing the connection. and to receive untyped data via IOConnectMethod/IOConnectAsyncMethod. As an IOService subclass, IOUserClient receives the normal Start()/Stop() lifecyle calls.
