``` source
void TimerOccurred(OSAction * action, uint64_t time);
```

## Discussion

Use this method as a prototype for declaring your own custom timer handlers. When declaring your method, use the TYPE macro to indicate that your method has the same parameters and return value as this method.

Use the implementation of your method to perform any custom actions related to the timerâ€™s expiration.
