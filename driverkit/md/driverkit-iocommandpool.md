class IOCommandPool;

## Overview

The IOCommandPool class is used to manipulate a pool of commands which inherit from IOCommand. The caller must put commands in the pool by creating the command (via the controllerâ€™s factory method or a memory allocation) and calling the returnCommand method with the newly created command as its argument.
