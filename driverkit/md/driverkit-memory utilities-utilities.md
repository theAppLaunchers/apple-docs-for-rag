# Memory Utilities

Allocate and deallocate memory and manage memory pointers in different address spaces.

## Topics

### Allocation

IONew

Allocates memory for an array of the specified type.

IONewZero

Allocates memory for an array of the specified type and zero-initializes that memory.

IOMalloc

Allocates the specified amount of general-purpose memory.

IOMallocZero

Allocates the specified amount of general-purpose memory and zero-initializes it.

OSTypeAlloc

Allocates memory for a named class.

### Deallocation

IODelete

Frees the memory associated with a valid, typed array.

IOSafeDeleteNULL

Frees the memory associated with a typed array.

OSSafeReleaseNULL

Frees memory that you allocated for a named class.

IOFree

Frees a memory block that contains general-purpose memory.

### Address Utilities

IOVMPageSize
