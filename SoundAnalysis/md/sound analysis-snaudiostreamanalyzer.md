## Mentioned in 

Classifying Sounds in an Audio Stream

## Overview

Run an SNRequest on an audio stream by creating an `SNAudioStreamAnalyzer`. You can run the same sound analysis request on multiple stream analyzers, and each analyzer can process multiple requests. An audio file analyzer generates an SNResult each time any of its active requests recognizes a sound.

## Topics

### Creating an Analyzer

init(format: AVAudioFormat)

Creates a new audio stream analyzer.

### Managing Requests

func add(any SNRequest, withObserver: any SNResultsObserving) throws

Adds a new analysis request to the audio stream analyzer.

protocol SNRequest

A protocol that represents sound analysis requests.

protocol SNResultsObserving

The interface your app implements to receive the results of an analysis request.

func remove(any SNRequest)

Removes an existing request from the audio stream analyzer.

func removeAllRequests()

Removes all the sound analysis requests from the audio stream analyzer.

### Analyzing Data

func analyze(AVAudioBuffer, atAudioFramePosition: AVAudioFramePosition)

Adds a new audio buffer to the analyzerâ€™s larger stream buffer.

func completeAnalysis()

Notifies the analyzer when it receives the final audio buffer.
