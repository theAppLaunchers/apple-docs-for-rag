## Discussion

Use this key to prioritize the execution of a specific architecture in a universal binary. This key contains an array of strings, with each string specifying the name of a supported architecture. The order of the strings in the array represents your preference for executing the app. For example, if you specify the `x86_64` architecture first for a universal app, the system runs that app under Rosetta translation on Apple silicon. For more information about Rosetta translation, see About the Rosetta translation environment.
