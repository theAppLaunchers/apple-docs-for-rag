Default: `NO`

## Discussion

You can include this key in any of the domain-specific dictionaries that you add to the NSExceptionDomains and NSPinnedDomains dictionaries. Adding the NSIncludesSubdomains key affects the applicability of the other configuration in the same domain-specific dictionary. The key is optional, with a default value of `NO`.

Set the value for this key to `YES` to apply the configuration for the given domain to all subdomains of the domain that have one additional path component. For example, if you set this value to `YES` and the domain name string is `example.com`, then the configuration applies to `example.com`, as well as `math.example.com` and `history.example.com`. However, it doesnâ€™t apply to the subdomains `advanced.math.example.com` or `ancient.history.example.com` because those subdomains have two additional path components. If the value is `NO` the configuration applies only to `example.com`.

If you create an NSExceptionDomains dictionary for an IP address or a range of addresses, the NSIncludesSubdomains key has no effect for that exception.
