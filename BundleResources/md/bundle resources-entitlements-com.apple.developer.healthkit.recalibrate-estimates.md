## Discussion

Apps can recalibrate HealthKit ºs prediction algorithms after an event that may significantly affect their results. For example, you can recalibrate the sixMinuteWalkTestDistance type to use only data collected after a mobility-impacting health event, such as surgery or an injury.

To check whether a sample type supports recalibration, see allowsRecalibrationForEstimates. To recalibrate the sample, see recalibrateEstimates(sampleType:date:completion:).
