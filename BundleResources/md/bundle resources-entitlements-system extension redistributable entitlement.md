## Discussion

Add this entitlement to a system extension that you create and sign using your development team credentials, but which other development teams distribute in their apps. This extension allows a distributing app to have a different team ID than the one associated with the system extension. If this entitlement isnâ€™t present, the team ID of the app and system extension must match.
