## Discussion

If `YES`, iOS opens a Wi-Fi connection when the app launches and keeps it open while the app is running. If `NO`, iOS closes the active Wi-Fi connection after 30 minutes. If the app tries to connect to the network when thereâ€™s no open Wi-Fi connection, the system may use the cellular network instead.
