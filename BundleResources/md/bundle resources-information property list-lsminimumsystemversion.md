## Discussion

Use this key to indicate the minimum macOS release that your app supports. The App Store uses this key to indicate the macOS releases on which your app can run, and to show compatibility with a personâ€™s Mac.

Starting with macOS 11.4, the lowest version number you can specify as the value for the LSMinimumSystemVersion key is:

- `10` if your app links against the macOS SDK.

- `10.15` if your app links against the iOS 14.3 SDK (or later) and builds using Mac Catalyst.

- `11` if your iPad or iPhone app links against the iOS 14.3 SDK (or later) and can run on a Mac with Apple silicon.

To specify the minimum version of iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, or watchOS that your app supports, use MinimumOSVersion.
