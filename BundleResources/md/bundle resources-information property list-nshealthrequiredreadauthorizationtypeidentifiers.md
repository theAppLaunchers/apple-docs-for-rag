## Discussion

Use this key to indicate that your app requires access to specific clinical record data types to function properly. Set the value to an array of strings containing the type identifiers for your required types. For a list of type identifiers, see HKClinicalTypeIdentifier.

To protect the userâ€™s privacy, you must specify three or more required clinical record types. If the user denies authorization to any of the types, authorization fails with an HKError.Code.errorRequiredAuthorizationDenied error. Your app is not told the record types to which the user denied access.
