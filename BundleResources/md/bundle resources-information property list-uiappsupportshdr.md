# UIAppSupportsHDR

A Boolean value that indicates whether the app supports HDR mode on Apple TV 4K.

tvOS 11.2+

## Details 

Name  
Supports HDR color mode

Type  

boolean

## Attributes 

Default: `YES`

## Discussion

If you set this key to `YES`, Apple TV 4K remains in HDR mode when launching the app. If you set this key to `NO`, Apple TV switches to SDR mode before launching the app, and switches back to HDR mode after the app resigns. The default value for this key is `YES`.

On Apple TV 4K, HDR mode uses the GPU to compose the content that appears onscreen. GPU-bound apps, such as games, can access more of the GPU by setting this key to `NO`. When an app switches between HDR and SDR modes, color flashing might appear onscreen, so only opt out when absolutely necessary.
