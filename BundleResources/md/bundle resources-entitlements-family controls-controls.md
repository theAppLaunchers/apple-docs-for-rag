## Discussion

You must add the Family Controls entitlement to your app before you call the AuthorizationCenter classâ€™s requestAuthorization(completionHandler:) or revokeAuthorization(completionHandler:) methods.

Adding the Family Controls capability to your app automatically sets this entitlement. Before submitting your app to the App Store, you must request permission to use the entitlement. For more information, see Adding capabilities to your app.
