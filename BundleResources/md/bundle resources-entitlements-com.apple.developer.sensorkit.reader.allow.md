## Discussion

An app can read sensor data from devices on a per-team basis, and the system closes your app if its code signature lacks this entitlement. To attain it, submit your research study to Apple as described in Accessing SensorKit Data. If Apple approves your study, you can create a provisioning profile that signs code with this entitlement. For more information, see Configuring your project for sensor reading.
