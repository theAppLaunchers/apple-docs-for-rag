## Overview

The `GLKVector2` type defines a 2-component floating-point vector as well as many mathematical operations commonly used to manipulate vectors. Graphics programming uses vectors extensively to represent positions, colors and other data structures.

The functions that manipulate `GLKVector2` structures treat the inputs as immutable, instead returning a new vector that represent the results of the operation.

### Fields

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| `x` | The first component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to a position. |
| `y` | The second component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to a position. |
| `s` | The first component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to texture coordinates. |
| `t` | The second component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to texture coordinates. |
| `v` | The elements of the vector expressed as an array. |
