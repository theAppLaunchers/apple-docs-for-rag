# GLKLightingType

A constant that describes how lighting is calculated by an effect.

## Overview

Typically, per-pixel lighting should be enabled when it provides an improvement in image quality without greatly reducing your applicationâ€™s performance. Calculating the lighting equation at each fragment greatly increases the number of calculations required to calculate the lighting for a scene. However, calculating lighting only at vertices sometimes produces unusual or inaccurate results, particularly when your application uses spotlights or specular highlighting. For example, when per-pixel lighting is disabled, a narrow spotlight projected at the center of a large triangle may disappear entirely because the vertices that define the triangle all lie outside the area covered by the spotlight. That same triangle, when rendered using per-pixel lighting, would be rendered correctly.

## Topics

### Constants

case perVertex

Indicates that the lighting calculations are performed at each vertex in a triangle and then interpolated across the triangle.

case perPixel

Indicates that the inputs to the lighting calculation are interpolated across a triangle and the lighting calculations are performed at each fragment.
