Instance Method

# glkViewControllerUpdate(\_:)

Called before each frame is displayed.

iOS 5.0+iPadOS 5.0+tvOS 9.0+

``` source
func glkViewControllerUpdate(_ controller: GLKViewController)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`controller`  

The controller that is about to display a new frame.

## Discussion

This method is used by your application if it wants to updates state information on each frame of animation. A typical implementation might read the controllerâ€™s timeSinceLastUpdate property to determine how much time has actually passed, and use that time to calculate the positions for any objects to be rendered in the next frame.
