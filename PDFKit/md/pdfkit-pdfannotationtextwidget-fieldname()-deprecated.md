## Discussion

Field names are optional, internal names that identify text fields in a PDF form. You use field names with the PDFActionResetForm action.

Note that multiple `PDFAnnotationTextWidget` objects with the same field name always have the same text associated with that field name. When text is entered into one of the objects, the text associated with that field name is changed in all objects. If you need to ensure unique text for a `PDFAnnotationTextWidget` object, you must give it a unique field name (you can use setFieldName(_:) to do this).
