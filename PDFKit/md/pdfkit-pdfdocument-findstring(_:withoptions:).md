``` source
func findString(
    _ string: String,
    withOptions options: NSString.CompareOptions = []
) -> [PDFSelection]
```

## Discussion

Each hit gets added to an `NSArray` object as a PDFSelection object. If there are no hits, this method returns an empty array.

Use this method when the complete search process will be brief and when you donâ€™t need the flexibility or control offered by beginFindString(_:withOptions:). For options, refer to Searching, Comparing, and Sorting Strings.
