## Discussion

The index is zero-based. This method throws an exception if `index` is out of range.

Important

In macOS 10.5 and later, a `PDFOutline` object retains all its children, so `childAtIndex:` returns the same retained child outline object every time itâ€™s called. This means that you do not need to retain the object returned by `childAtIndex:`. This differs from the behavior of `PDFOutline` in OS X v10.4. In Tiger, `childAtIndex:` returns an auto-released, one-off child outline object, when meant that you had to include code to retain the child.
