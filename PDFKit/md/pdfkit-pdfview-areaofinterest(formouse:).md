## Discussion

The `PDFAreaOfInterest` enumeration defines the various area types. This method is for custom subclasses of the `PDFView` class. Use it if you override the `NSResponder` classâ€™s mouseMoved(with:) method or related methods.

Refer to `Constants` for the various values of the area-of-interest constants. Each of these constants contributes to the value of the `PDFAreaOfInterest` bit field.
