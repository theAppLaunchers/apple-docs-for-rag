func setQuadrilateralPoints(_ points: [Any]!)
```

## Discussion

The points defined by each quadrilateral array should encompass a word or a contiguous group of words. The quadrilateral points are ordered counterclockwise, with the first point closest to the origin in page space.

Page space is a 72 dpi coordinate system with the origin at the lower-left corner of the current page.
