## Mentioned in 

Adding Custom Graphics to a PDF

## Overview

`PDFView` may be the only class you need to deal with for adding PDF functionality to your application. It lets you display PDF data and allows users to select content, navigate through a document, set zoom level, and copy textual content to the Pasteboard. `PDFView` also keeps track of page history.

You can subclass `PDFView` to create a custom PDF viewer.

You can also create a custom PDF viewer by using the PDF Kit utility classes directly and not using `PDFView` at all.
