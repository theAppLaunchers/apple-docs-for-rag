# Using Safari app extension default keys

Learn about the default keys in the information property list file.

## Overview

After you create a Safari app extension target in Xcode, you need to modify the information property list file, `Info.plist.` You make changes to identify your new Safari app extension, and specify its capabilities and access limits under the `NSExtension` key.

The keys under the `NSExtension` key apply to the Safari app extension point, `com.apple.Safari.extension` for macOS. Place these keys as subordinates of the `NSExtension` key.

A Safari app extension includes these entries by default:

`NSExtensionPointIdentifier`  
An identifier string to indicate a Safari extension: `com.apple.Safari.extension`.

`NSExtensionPrincipalClass`  
A string to indicate the class with the principal implementation for your extension, with a value of `SafariExtensionHandler`, which the `SafariExtensionHandler.swift` file defines in Swift, and the `SafariExtensionHandler.h` and `SafariExtensionHandler.m` files define in Objective-C.

`SFSafariContentScript`  
An array of dictionaries with a single entry, containing a `Script` key that specifies the `script.js` file in the template. When your extension loads, Safari automatically embeds this script file into every webpage that a user visits and the extension has access to. See Injecting a script into a webpage.

`SFSafariToolbarItem`  
A dictionary describing a toolbar item that uses the `ToolbarItemIcon.pdf` image from the template as the image for the button. See Adjusting settings for a toolbar item.

`SFSafariWebsiteAccess`  
A dictionary with two keys: the `Level` key to indicate the level of access (set to `Some`), and the `Allowed Domains` key, which includes an array of strings to limit the web addresses that your extension works with. For more information, see Adjusting website access permissions.

Although `SFSafariContentScript`, `SFSafariToolbarItem`, and `SFSafariWebsiteAccess` are all default keys, theyâ€™re not required because they specify features that may or may not exist in your Safari app extension. To learn more about feature keys, see Setting Safari app extension feature keys.

### Review the sample information property list

The code example below represents the overall structure of a typical `NSExtension` dictionary. Keep this structure in mind as you configure each element of your app extension.
