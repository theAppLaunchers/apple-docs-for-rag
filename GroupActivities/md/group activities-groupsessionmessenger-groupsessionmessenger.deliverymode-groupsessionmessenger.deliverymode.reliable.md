## Discussion

Use this approach to send messages that are critical to the experience you create. The GroupSessionMessenger enqueues a message until it is successfully transmitted to all known participants. The system doesnâ€™t guarantee delivery to participants who join a group session after you send a message, or who leave the group prior to delivery.
