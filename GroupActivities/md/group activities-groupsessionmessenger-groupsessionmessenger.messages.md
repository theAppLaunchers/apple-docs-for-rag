# GroupSessionMessenger.Messages

An asynchronous sequence of messages sent to the session.

struct Messages where Message : Decodable, Message : Encodable
```

## Overview

When you use a GroupSessionMessenger to communicate across devices, the `Messages` structure provides the sequence of messages the other devices send. Iterate over the contents of this structure asynchronously to retrieve each message and update your app.

Donâ€™t create this structure directly. Instead, use the messages(of:) or messages(of:) method to retrieve the messages for a given session.

## Topics

### Creating an iterator

func makeAsyncIterator() -> GroupSessionMessenger.Messages&lt;Message>.Iterator

Creates the asynchronous iterator that produces elements of this asynchronous sequence.

struct Iterator

typealias Element

The type of element produced by this asynchronous sequence.

### Finding elements

func contains(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.

func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfy the given predicate.

func first(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?

Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.

func min(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?

Returns the minimum element in the asynchronous sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.

func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?

Returns the maximum element in the asynchronous sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.

### Selecting elements

func prefix(Int) -> AsyncPrefixSequence&lt;Self>

Returns an asynchronous sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the base asynchronous sequence.

func prefix(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) rethrows -> AsyncPrefixWhileSequence&lt;Self>

Returns an asynchronous sequence, containing the initial, consecutive elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.

### Excluding elements

func dropFirst(Int) -> AsyncDropFirstSequence&lt;Self>

Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.

func drop(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncDropWhileSequence&lt;Self>

Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.

func filter((Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncFilterSequence&lt;Self>

Creates an asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.

### Transforming a sequence

func reduce&lt;Result>(Result, (Result, Self.Element) async throws -> Result) async rethrows -> Result

Returns the result of combining the elements of the asynchronous sequence using the given closure.

func reduce&lt;Result>(into: Result, (inout Result, Self.Element) async throws -> Void) async rethrows -> Result

Returns the result of combining the elements of the asynchronous sequence using the given closure, given a mutable initial value.

### Type Aliases

### Receiving data from other participants

func messages(of: Data.Type) -> GroupSessionMessenger.Messages&lt;Data>

Returns the asynchronous sequence of messages that contain a generic data object.

func messages&lt;Message>(of: Message.Type) -> GroupSessionMessenger.Messages&lt;Message>

Returns the asynchronous sequence of messages that match the app-specific type.

struct MessageContext

A structure that contains additional information about an incoming message, such as which device sent it.
