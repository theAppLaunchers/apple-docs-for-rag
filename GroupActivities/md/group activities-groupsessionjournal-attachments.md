## Discussion

This property contains an asynchronous sequence that you monitor while the current session is active. To monitor this sequence, configure an asynchronous task and iterate over the contents of the GroupSessionJournal.Attachments type. For an example of how to configure this task, see the overview for GroupSessionJournal.

The system updates this array whenever a participant adds or removes an attachment. Iterate over the array and update your appâ€™s data structures to match the current contents.
