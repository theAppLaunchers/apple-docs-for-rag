## Discussion

Include this option when your activity includes left-right directions in the video for the FaceTime call. The option mirrors the video along the vertical axis, which makes it easy for participants to mimic an instuctorâ€™s movements. Without mirroring, views move in the opposite direction of the instructor, which can be jarring.
