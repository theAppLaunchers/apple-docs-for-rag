## Discussion

If your app presents an immersive space, set this property to `true` if you want the system to display spatial Personas when that space is open. The default value of this property is `false`.

An immersive space places a person in their own private experience. To prevent the disruption of that experience, the system disables spatial Personas by default when any immersive space is open. Setting this property to `true` tells the system that it can once again display spatial Personas when an immersive space is open.

When displaying spatial Personas in an immersive space, the system establishes a shared coordinate space among the participants. Specifically, the system moves the origin of the coordinate space to a shared location, which it derives from the template in the spatialTemplatePreference property. Any content you place in the immersive space subsequently appears in the correct relative location from each participant’s perspective. To place content in front of a specific participant, use a GeometryReader3D object to read the geometry of your scene. The doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swiftui/geometryproxy3d/immersivespacedisplacement(in:) method of GeometryProxy3D provides you with the offset from the current participant to the shared origin, which you can use to position your content.
