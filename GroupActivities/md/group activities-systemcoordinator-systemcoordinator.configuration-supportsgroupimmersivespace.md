## Discussion

If your app presents an immersive space, set this property to `true` if you want the system to display spatial Personas when that space is open. The default value of this property is `false`.

An immersive space places a person in their own private experience. To prevent the disruption of that experience, the system disables spatial Personas by default when any immersive space is open. Setting this property to `true` tells the system that it can once again display spatial Personas when an immersive space is open.

When displaying spatial Personas in an immersive space, the system establishes a shared coordinate space among the participants. Specifically, the system moves the origin of the coordinate space to a shared location, which it derives from the template in the spatialTemplatePreference property. Any content you place in the immersive space subsequently appears in the correct relative location from each participantâ€™s perspective. To place content in front of a specific participant, use a GeometryReader3D object to read the geometry of your scene. The doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swiftui/geometryproxy3d/immersivespacedisplacement(in:) method of GeometryProxy3D provides you with the offset from the current participant to the shared origin, which you can use to position your content.
