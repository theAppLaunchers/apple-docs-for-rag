## Parameters 

`attachment`  

The attachment object associated with the item. You receive this object when you call the add(_:) or add(_:metadata:) method.

## Discussion

Call this method to remove an attachment that is no longer relevant. For example, you might remove an attachment containing a photo in response to someone deleting that photo from the activity. When you remove an attachment, the journal object updates the array of attachments and sends it to all participants. Remove any attachments from your app that arenâ€™t still in the array.
