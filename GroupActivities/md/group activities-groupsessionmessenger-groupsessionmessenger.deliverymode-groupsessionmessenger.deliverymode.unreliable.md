## Discussion

Use this approach when itâ€™s okay to drop messages occasionally. Typically, you use this approach for messages you send frequently with similar information. For example, use it when the information in each new message replaces information in the preceding message.

This approach makes a best-effort attempt to deliver your messages to the known participants, and makes no guarantees on the delivery order of messages.
