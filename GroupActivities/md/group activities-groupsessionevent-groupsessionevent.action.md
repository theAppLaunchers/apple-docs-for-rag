## Overview

Use this structure to communicate playback-related changes to participants using the system UI. You can use this structure to communicate the following types of events:

- Transport-related events for a custom player.

- Changes to a playback queue your app manages.

When a change occurs in your custom player or playback queue, create an instance of this structure to describe the change and wrap it in a GroupSessionEvent structure. To display the event to the participant call the showNotice(_:) method of the session. The system formats and displays the information you provide.

Note

If your app uses AV Foundation to play content, you donâ€™t need to communicate transport-related events yourself. AV Foundation generates appropriate events when the user plays, pauses, seeks, or skips tracks.
