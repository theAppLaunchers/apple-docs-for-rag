## Discussion

After you join an activity, access this property to determine if a system coordinator object is available. The system coordinator informs you when the device supports spatial Personas, and when the current participantâ€™s spatial Persona is available to use in the current activity. When a spatial Persona is available, update the information you share for the activity and how you present that content. For more information, see SystemCoordinator.
