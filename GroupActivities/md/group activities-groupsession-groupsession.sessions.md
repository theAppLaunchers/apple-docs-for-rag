Structure

# GroupSession.Sessions

An asynchronous sequence of sessions you use to manage a specific activity.

``` source
struct Sessions
```

Available when `ActivityType` conforms to `GroupActivity`.

## Overview

When a participant engages one of your app’s activities, a `Sessions` structure provides the session you use to handle synchronization. Iterate over the contents of this structure asynchronously to retrieve each new session the system delivers to your app. The system delivers only one GroupSession for each activity. To monitor changes to that session, configure subscribers to its published properties.

Don’t create this structure directly. Instead, use the sessions() method to retrieve the sessions.

## Topics

### Creating an iterator

func makeAsyncIterator() -> GroupSession&lt;ActivityType>.Sessions.Iterator

Creates the asynchronous iterator that produces elements of this asynchronous sequence.

struct Iterator

typealias Element

The type of element produced by this asynchronous sequence.

### Finding elements

func contains(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.

func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfy the given predicate.

func first(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?

Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.

func min(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?

Returns the minimum element in the asynchronous sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.

func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?

Returns the maximum element in the asynchronous sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.

### Selecting elements

func prefix(Int) -> AsyncPrefixSequence&lt;Self>

Returns an asynchronous sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the base asynchronous sequence.

func prefix(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) rethrows -> AsyncPrefixWhileSequence&lt;Self>

Returns an asynchronous sequence, containing the initial, consecutive elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.

### Excluding elements

func dropFirst(Int) -> AsyncDropFirstSequence&lt;Self>

Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.

func drop(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncDropWhileSequence&lt;Self>

Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.

func filter((Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncFilterSequence&lt;Self>

Creates an asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.

### Transforming a sequence

func reduce&lt;Result>(Result, (Result, Self.Element) async throws -> Result) async rethrows -> Result

Returns the result of combining the elements of the asynchronous sequence using the given closure.

func reduce&lt;Result>(into: Result, (inout Result, Self.Element) async throws -> Void) async rethrows -> Result

Returns the result of combining the elements of the asynchronous sequence using the given closure, given a mutable initial value.

### Type Aliases
