## Discussion

A `Sessions` type contains a sequence of GroupSession objects specific to the current activity. The sessions() method returns this type, and you use it to retrieve the current session, if any, for that activity. The system creates only one GroupSession object for each new activity. To detect changes to the sessionâ€™s state, activity type, or active participants, subscribe to the corresponding properties.
