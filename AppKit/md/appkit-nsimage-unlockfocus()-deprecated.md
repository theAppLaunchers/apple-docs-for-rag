# unlockFocus()

Removes the focus from the image.

``` source
func unlockFocus()
```

Deprecated

Use init(size:flipped:drawingHandler:) instead.

## Discussion

This message must be sent after a successful lockFocus() or lockFocusOnRepresentation: message and the completion of any intermediate drawing commands. This method restores the focus to the previous owner, if any.

Do not send this message if the preceding call to lock focus raised an `NSImageCacheException`.
