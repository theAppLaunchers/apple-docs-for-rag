Initializer

# init(byFilteringData:ofType:)

Creates a new pasteboard object that supplies the specified data in as many types as possible based on the available filter services.

macOS

``` source
init(
    byFilteringData data: Data,
    ofType type: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType
)
```

## Parameters 

`data`  

The data to be placed on the pasteboard.

`type`  

The type of data in the `data` parameter.

## Return Value

The new pasteboard object.

## Discussion

The returned pasteboard also declares data of the supplied `type`.

No filter service is invoked until the data is actually requested, so invoking this method is reasonably inexpensive.
