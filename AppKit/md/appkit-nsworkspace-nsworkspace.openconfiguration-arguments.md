Instance Property

# arguments

The set of command-line arguments to pass to a new app instance at launch time.

macOS 10.15+

``` source
var arguments: [String] { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value of this property is an empty array. When launching a new instance of an app, use this property to specify any additional launch arguments. The system inserts the appâ€™s path as the first element in the array.

If the calling process is sandboxed, the system ignores the value of this property.
