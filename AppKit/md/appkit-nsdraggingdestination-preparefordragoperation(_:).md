Instance Method

# prepareForDragOperation(\_:)

Invoked when the image is released, allowing the receiver to agree to or refuse drag operation.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
optional func prepareForDragOperation(_ sender: any NSDraggingInfo) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`sender`  

The object sending the message; use it to get details about the dragging operation.

## Return Value

true if the receiver agrees to perform the drag operation and false if not.

## Discussion

This method is invoked only if the most recent draggingEntered(_:) or draggingUpdated(_:) message returned an acceptable drag-operation value.

If you want the drag items to animate from their current location on screen to their final location in your view, set the sender objectâ€™s animatesToDestination property to true in your implementation of this method.
