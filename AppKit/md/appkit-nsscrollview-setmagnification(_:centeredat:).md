macOS 10.8+

@MainActor
func setMagnification(
    _ magnification: CGFloat,
    centeredAt point: NSPoint
)
```

## Parameters 

`magnification`  

The amount by which to magnify the content.

`point`  

The point (in content view space) on which to center magnification.

## Discussion

This method scales the content view such that the passed in point (in content view space) remains at the same screen location once the scaling is completed. The resulting magnification value is clipped to the minMagnification and maxMagnification values. To animate the magnification, use the objectâ€™s animator.
