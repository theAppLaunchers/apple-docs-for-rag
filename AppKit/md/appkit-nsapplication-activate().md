## Mentioned in 

Passing control from one app to another with cooperative activation

## Discussion

Use this method to request app activation; calling this method doesnâ€™t guarantee app activation. For cooperative activation, the other app should call yieldActivation(to:) or equivalent before the target app invokes activate().

Invoking activate() on an already-active application cancels any pending activation yields by the receiver.
