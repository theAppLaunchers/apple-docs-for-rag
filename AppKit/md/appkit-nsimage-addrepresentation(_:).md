Instance Method

# addRepresentation(\_:)

Adds the specified image representation object to the image.

macOS

``` source
func addRepresentation(_ imageRep: NSImageRep)
```

## Parameters 

`imageRep`  

The image representation to add.

## Discussion

After invoking this method, you may need to explicitly set features of the new image representation, such as the size, number of colors, and so on. This is true particularly when the `NSImage` object has multiple image representations to choose from. See NSImageRep and its subclasses for the methods you use to complete initialization.

Any representation added by this method is retained by the receiver. Image representations cannot be shared among multiple `NSImage` objects.
