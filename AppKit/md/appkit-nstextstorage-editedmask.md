Instance Property

# editedMask

A mask that describes the kinds of edits pending for the text storage object.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
var editedMask: NSTextStorageEditActions { get }
```

## Discussion

This property indicates pending changes for attributes, characters, or both. Use the C bitwise AND operator to test the value against the editedAttributes or editedCharacters constants; testing for equality fails if you add additional mask flags later. The text storage objectâ€™s associated delegate and layout managers can use this information to determine the nature of edits in their respective notification methods.
