A Boolean value that defines whether a button’s action has a destructive effect.

``` source
@MainActor
var hasDestructiveAction: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value of `hasDestructiveAction` is `false`. Setting this to `true` allows the system to guard a destructive-action button against accidental presses, and can give the button a special appearance in certain contexts to caution against unintentional use.
