## Discussion

`NSTextView` posts this notification whenever setSelectedRange(_:affinity:stillSelecting:) is invoked, either directly or through the many methods (mouseDown(with:), selectAll(_:), and so on) that invoke it indirectly. When the user is selecting text, this notification is posted only once, at the end of the selection operation. The text viewâ€™s delegate receives a textViewDidChangeSelection(_:) message when this notification is posted.

The notification object is the notifying text view. The `userInfo` dictionary contains the following information:

| Key | Value |
|----|----|
| `@"NSOldSelectedCharacterRange"` | An `NSValue` object containing an `NSRange` structure with the originally selected range. |
