Instance Property

# architecture

The architecture version of the app to launch.

macOS 10.15+

``` source
var architecture: cpu_type_t { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value of this property is `CPU_TYPE_ANY`, which causes the system to launch the appâ€™s preferred architecture. You may specify a different value to force the system to launch that architecture. For a list of possible types, see the `` header file.
