# NSPlaceholders

A set of methods that an object can implement to register default placeholders to be displayed for a binding, when no other placeholder is specified.

## Overview

Individual placeholder values can be specified for each of the marker objects (described in Selection Markers), as well as when the property is `nil`.

Placeholders are used when a property of an instance of the receiving class is accessed through a key value coding compliant method, and returns `nil` or a specialized marker.

## Topics

### Managing default placeholders

class func setDefaultPlaceholder(_ placeholder: Any?, for marker: Any?, with binding: NSBindingName)

Sets \`placeholder\` as the default placeholder for the \`binding\`, when a key value coding compliant property of an instance of the receiving class returns the value specified by \`marker\`, and no other placeholder has been specified.

Deprecated

class func defaultPlaceholder(for marker: Any?, with binding: NSBindingName) -> Any?

Returns an object that will be used as the placeholder for the \`binding\`, when a key value coding compliant property of an instance of the receiving class returns the value specified by \`marker\`, and no other placeholder has been specified.
