Instance Method

# rulerView(\_:handleMouseDownWith:)

Informs the client that the user has pressed the mouse button while the cursor is in the ruler area of `aRulerView`.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func rulerView(
    _ ruler: NSRulerView,
    handleMouseDownWith event: NSEvent
)
```

## Discussion

`theEvent` is the mouse-down event that triggered the message. The client view can implement this method to perform an action such as adding a new marker using `NSRulerMarkerClientViewDelegation` or adding layout guidelines.
