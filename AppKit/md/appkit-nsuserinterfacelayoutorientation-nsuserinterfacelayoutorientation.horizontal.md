Case

# NSUserInterfaceLayoutOrientation.horizontal

The horizontal orientation.

macOS 10.9+

``` source
case horizontal
```

## Discussion

Use this constant in the orientation property to specify a horizontal layout for the stack view. Use it to specify the horizontal user interface axis for clipping resistance and hugging priority.

The leading, center, and trailing gravity areas in a horizontal stack view are arranged left to right or right to left depending on the value of the inherited userInterfaceLayoutDirection property.
