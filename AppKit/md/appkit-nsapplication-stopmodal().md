Instance Method

# stopModal()

Stops a modal event loop.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func stopModal()
```

## Discussion

This method should always be paired with a previous invocation of runModal(for:) or beginModalSession(for:). When runModal(for:) is stopped with this method, it returns `NSModalResponseStop`. In macOS 10.9 and later, you can use this method to stop a runModal(for:) loop outside of an event callback, such as from within a method repeatedly invoked by an Timer object or a method running in a different thread.
