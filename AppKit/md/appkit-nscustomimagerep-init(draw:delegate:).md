Initializer

# init(draw:delegate:)

Returns a representation of an image initialized with the specified delegate information.

macOS

``` source
init(
    draw selector: Selector,
    delegate: Any
)
```

## Parameters 

`selector`  

The selector to call when it is time to draw the image. The method should take a single parameter of type `id` that represents the NSCustomImageRep object that initiated drawing. The method must draw the image starting at the point (0, 0) in the current coordinate system.

`delegate`  

The delegate object that responds to the selector in `aMethod`.

## Return Value

An initialized NSCustomImageRep object, or `nil` if the object could not be initialized.

## Discussion

When the receiver is asked to draw the image, it sends the specified message to the selector, passing itself as a parameter to the delegate method. The delegateâ€™s drawing method should have the following form:

```
- (void)myCustomDrawMethod:(id)anNSCustomImageRep;
```
