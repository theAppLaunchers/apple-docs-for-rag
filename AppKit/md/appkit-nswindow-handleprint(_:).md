Instance Method

# handlePrint(\_:)

Handles the AppleScript command to print the contents of the window (or its associated document, if any).

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func handlePrint(_ command: NSScriptCommand) -> Any?
```

## Discussion

If thereâ€™s a corresponding document and the window is the main window of the document, it forwards the `print` command to the corresponding document. Otherwise, the window sends itself a `print` message.
