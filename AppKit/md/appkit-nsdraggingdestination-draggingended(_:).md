Instance Method

# draggingEnded(\_:)

Called when a drag operation ends.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
optional func draggingEnded(_ sender: any NSDraggingInfo)
```

## Parameters 

`sender`  

The object sending the message; use it to get details about the dragging operation.

## Discussion

Implement this method if you want to be notified when a drag operation ends, which can be useful if the drag ends in some other destination. For example, this method might be used by a destination doing auto-expansion in order to collapse any auto-expands.
