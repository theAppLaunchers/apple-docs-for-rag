Instance Method

# convert(\_:toFace:)

Returns a font whose traits are as similar as possible to those of the given font except for the typeface, which is changed to the given typeface.

macOS

``` source
func convert(
    _ fontObj: NSFont,
    toFace typeface: String
) -> NSFont?
```

## Parameters 

`fontObj`  

The font whose traits are matched.

`typeface`  

The new typeface; a fully specified family-face name, such as Helvetica-BoldOblique or Times-Roman.

## Return Value

A font with matching traits and the given typeface, or `aFont` if it canâ€™t be converted.

## Discussion

This method attempts to match the weight and posture of `aFont` as closely as possible. Italic is mapped to Oblique, for example. Weights are mapped based on an approximate numeric scale of 0 to 15.
