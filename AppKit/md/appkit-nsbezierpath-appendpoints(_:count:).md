Instance Method

# appendPoints(\_:count:)

Appends a series of line segments to the path.

macOS

``` source
func appendPoints(
    _ points: NSPointArray,
    count: Int
)
```

## Parameters 

`points`  

A C-style array of `NSPoint` data types, each of which contains the end point of the next line segment.

`count`  

The number of points in the `points` parameter.

## Discussion

This method interprets the points as a set of connected line segments. If the current path contains an open subpath, a line is created from the last point in that subpath to the first point in the points array. If the current path is empty, the first point in the points array is used to set the starting point of the line segments. Subsequent line segments are added using the remaining points in the array.

This method does not close the path that is created. If you wish to create a closed path, you must do so by explicitly invoking the receiverâ€™s close() method.
