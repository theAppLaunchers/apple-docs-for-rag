Instance Property

# documentClassNames

An array of strings representing the custom document classes supported by this app.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var documentClassNames: [String] { get }
```

## Discussion

The items in the array are NSString objects, each of which represents the name of a document subclasses supported by the app. The document class names are derived from the appâ€™s `Info.plist`. You can override this property and use it to return the names of document classes that are dynamically loaded from plugins.
