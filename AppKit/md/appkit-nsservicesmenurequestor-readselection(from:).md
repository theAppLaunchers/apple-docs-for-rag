# readSelection(from:)

Reads data from the pasteboard and uses it to replace the current selection.

macOS

``` source
optional func readSelection(from pboard: NSPasteboard) -> Bool

`pboard`  

The pasteboard containing the data to read.

## Discussion

You implement this method to replace your applicationâ€™s current selection (that is, the text or objects that are currently selected) with the data on the pasteboard. The data would have been placed in the pasteboard by another application in response to a remote message from the Services menu. A readSelection(from:) message is sent to the same object that previously received a writeSelection(to:types:) message.
