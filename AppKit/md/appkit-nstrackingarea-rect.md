Instance Property

# rect

The rectangle defining the area encompassed by the receiver.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
var rect: NSRect { get }
```

## Discussion

The rectangle is specified in the local coordinate system of the associated view. If the inVisibleRect option is specified, the receiver is automatically synchronized with changes in the viewâ€™s visible area (visibleRect) and the value of this property is ignored.
