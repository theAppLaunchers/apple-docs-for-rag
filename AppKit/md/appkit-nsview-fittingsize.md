Instance Property

# fittingSize

The minimum size of the view that satisfies the constraints it holds.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
@MainActor
var fittingSize: NSSize { get }
```

## Discussion

AppKit sets this property to the best size available for the view, considering all of the constraints it and its subviews hold and satisfying a preference to make the view as small as possible. The size values in this property are never negative.
