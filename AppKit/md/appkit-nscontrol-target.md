Instance Property

# target

The target object that receives action messages from the cell.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
weak var target: AnyObject? { get set }
```

## Discussion

When the value of this property is `nil`, the application follows the responder chain looking for an object that can respond to the message. See the description of the NSActionCell class for details.
