Type Property

# prefersTrackingUntilMouseUp

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the `NSSliderCell` continues to track the pointer until the next mouse up.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
class var prefersTrackingUntilMouseUp: Bool { get }
```

## Return Value

true if the `NSSliderCell` continues to track the pointer even after it leaves the cellâ€™s tracking rectangle; otherwise, false. By default, this method returns true.

## Discussion

If this method returns true, users retain control of the knob until they release the mouse button, even if they drag the pointer to the other side of the screen.

You should not call this method explicitly. Override it if you create a subclass of `NSSliderCell` that should track the mouse differently.
