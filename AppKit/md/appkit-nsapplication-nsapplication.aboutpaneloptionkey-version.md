static let version: NSApplication.AboutPanelOptionKey
```

## Discussion

The value of this key is an NSString object with the build version number of the app, such as `58.4`. AppKit displays this string as `(v58.4)`. If not specified, AppKit obtains the version number from the CFBundleVersion key of the appâ€™s Info.plist file. If no version information is found, AppKit does not display version information.
