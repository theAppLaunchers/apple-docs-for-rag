Instance Method

# rightMouseDown(with:)

Informs the receiver that the user has pressed the right mouse button.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func rightMouseDown(with event: NSEvent)
```

## Parameters 

`event`  

An object encapsulating information about the mouse-down event.

## Discussion

The default implementation simply passes this message to the next responder.

Note

Prior to OS X v10.7, NSView did not pass unhandled rightMouseDown(with:) events up the responder chain. In macOS 10.7 and later, NSView passes rightMouseDown(with:) events up the responder chain if AppKit doesnâ€™t find an associated context menu to display for the view. To avoid binary compatibility issues, this new behavior is enabled only for applications linked on macOS 10.7 or later.
