Instance Method

# animation(\_:valueForProgress:)

Requests a custom curve value for the current progress value.

macOS

``` source
nonisolated
optional func animation(
    _ animation: NSAnimation,
    valueForProgress progress: NSAnimation.Progress
) -> Float
```

## Parameters 

`animation`  

An `NSAnimation` object that is running.

`progress`  

A `float` value (typed as `NSAnimationProgress`) that indicates a progress mark of `animation`. This value is always between 0.0 and 1.0.

## Return Value

A `float` value representing a custom curve.

## Discussion

The delegate can compute and return a custom curve value for the given progress value. If the delegate does not implement this method, `NSAnimation` computes the current curve value.

The animation:valueForProgress: message is sent to the delegate when an `NSAnimation` object receives a currentValue message. The value the delegate returns is used as the value of currentValue; if there is no delegate, or it doesnâ€™t implement animation:valueForProgress:, `NSAnimation` computes and returns the current value. `NSAnimation` does not invoke currentValueitself, but subclasses might.

See the description of currentValue for more information.

func animationShouldStart(NSAnimation) -> Bool

Sent to the delegate just after an animation is started.
