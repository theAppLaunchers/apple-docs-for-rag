Instance Property

# automaticallyAdjustsContentInsets

A Boolean that indicates whether the scroll view automatically adjusts its content insets.

macOS 10.10+

``` source
@MainActor
var automaticallyAdjustsContentInsets: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When the value of this property is true, the scroll view automatically sets its contentInsets property to account for any overlapping title or tool bar. To overlap with the title or tool bar, the window style mask must include `NSFullSizeContentViewWindowMask` and the title bar must not be transparent.

The default value of this property is true.
