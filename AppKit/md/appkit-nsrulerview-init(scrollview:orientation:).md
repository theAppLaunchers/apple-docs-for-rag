Initializer

# init(scrollView:orientation:)

Initializes a newly allocated NSRulerView to have `orientation` (`NSHorizontalRuler` or `NSVerticalRuler`) within `aScrollView`.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
init(
    scrollView: NSScrollView?,
    orientation: NSRulerView.Orientation
)
```

## Discussion

The new ruler view displays the userâ€™s preferred measurement units and has no client, markers, or accessory view. Unlike most subclasses of NSView, no initial frame rectangle is given for NSRulerView; its containing NSScrollView adjusts its frame rectangle as needed.

This method is the designated initializer for the NSRulerView class. Returns an initialized object.
