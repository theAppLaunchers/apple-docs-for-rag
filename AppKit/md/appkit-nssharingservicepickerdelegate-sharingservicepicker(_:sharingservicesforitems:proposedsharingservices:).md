Instance Method

# sharingServicePicker(\_:sharingServicesForItems:proposedSharingServices:)

Asks the delegate to specify which services to make available from the sharing service picker.

macOS 10.8+

``` source
optional func sharingServicePicker(
    _ sharingServicePicker: NSSharingServicePicker,
    sharingServicesForItems items: [Any],
    proposedSharingServices proposedServices: [NSSharingService]
) -> [NSSharingService]
```

## Parameters 

`sharingServicePicker`  

The sharing service picker.

`items`  

The items to share. Use the set of items to determine which services are relevant.

`proposedServices`  

The proposed services to include in the sharing service picker.

## Return Value

An array of services to include in the sharing service picker.

## Discussion

Use this method to remove default services, add custom services, or reorder the existing services before the picker appears onscreen. Unless you donâ€™t intend to change the proposed services, create a new mutable array and fill it with the services that are appropriate for the specified set of items. The following example appends a custom NSSharingService object to the proposed list of services.

```
        NSMutableArray *sharingServices = [proposedServices mutableCopy];
        NSSharingService * customService = [[[NSSharingService alloc]   initWithTitle:@"Service Title"
                                                                        image:image alternateImage:alternateImage
                                                                        handler:^{
                                                                            [self doCustomServiceWithItems:items];
                                           }] autorelease];
        [sharingServices addObject:customService];
        return [sharingServices autorelease];
```
