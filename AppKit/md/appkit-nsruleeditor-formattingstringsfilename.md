## Discussion

The `NSRuleEditor` class looks for a strings file with the given name in the main bundle and (if appropriate) the bundle containing the nib file from which it was loaded. If it finds a strings file resource with the given name, `NSRuleEditor` loads it and sets it as the formatting dictionary for the receiver. You can obtain the resulting dictionary using the formattingDictionary property\].

If you assign a new dictionary to the formattingDictionary property, it sets the current to formatting strings file name to `nil`.
