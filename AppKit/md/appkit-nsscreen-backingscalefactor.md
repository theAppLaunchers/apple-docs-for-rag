# backingScaleFactor

The backing store pixel scale factor for the screen.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
var backingScaleFactor: CGFloat { get }
```

## Discussion

This is the scale factor representing the number of backing store pixels corresponding to each linear unit in screen space on this screen.

This method is provided for rare cases when the explicit scale factor is needed. As often as possible, you should use the NSView classâ€™s convert backing methods.
