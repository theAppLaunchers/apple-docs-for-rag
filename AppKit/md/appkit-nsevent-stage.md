Instance Property

# stage

A value that indicates the stage of a pressure gesture event.

``` source
var stage: Int { get }
```

## Discussion

Gesture events of type NSEvent.EventType.pressure can go through multiple stages. This property indicates the current stage of the event.

If this property has a value of `0`, there isnâ€™t enough pressure to initiate or continue with the gesture. Effectively, this value will exist only when an event ends, as some level of pressure will be applied throughout the gesture.

A value of `1` indicates that the user applied enough pressure to represent a mouse-down event.

A value of `2` suggests that the user applied additional pressure beyond what the requirement for a typical mouse-down event. A stage value of `2` should generally be used to initiate a lookup or immediate action; for example, force clicking (pressing harder) on an element, such as a contact in an email message, to display a Quick Look window or to enter edit mode.

Typically, as a gesture event moves between stages, the user will receive light tactile feedback.

Stages do not always occur in sequence. For example, ending the gesture with a stage value of `2` may result in an immediate transition to a stage value of `0`. As such, the gesture event may skip over stage 1.
