Instance Property

# constant

The constant added to the multiplied second attribute participating in the constraint.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
var constant: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

Unlike the other properties, the constant can be modified after constraint creation. Setting the constant on an existing constraint performs much better than removing the constraint and adding a new one thatâ€™s exactly like the old except that it has a different constant.
