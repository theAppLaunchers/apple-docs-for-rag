Instance Property

# contentViewController

The view controller that manages the content of the popover.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
@IBOutlet @MainActor
var contentViewController: NSViewController? { get set }
```

## Discussion

You must set the content view controller of the popover before the popover is shown. Changes to the popoverâ€™s content view controller while the popover is shown will cause the popover to animate if the animates property is true.

The default value is `nil`.
