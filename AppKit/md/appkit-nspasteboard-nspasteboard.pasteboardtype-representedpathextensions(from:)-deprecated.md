Type Method

# representedPathExtensions(from:)

Returns an array of file types based on the passed pasteboard types.

macOS

``` source
static func representedPathExtensions(from pboardTypes: [NSPasteboard.PasteboardType]) -> [String]?
```

Deprecated

The file contents pboard type allowed you to synthesize a pboard type for a file’s contents based on the file’s extension. Using the UTI of a file to represent its contents now replaces this functionality.

## Discussion

Accepts a null-terminated array of pointers to pasteboard types and returns a null-terminated array of the unique extensions and filenames from the file content and filename types found in the input array. It returns `nil` if the input array contains no file content or filename types. The returned array is allocated and must be freed by the caller. The pointers in the return array point into strings passed in the input array.
