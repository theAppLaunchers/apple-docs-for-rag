## Topics

### Constants

static var visible: NSWindow.OcclusionState

If set, at least part of the window is visible; if not set, the entire window is occluded. A window that has a nonrectangular shape can be entirely occluded onscreen, but if its bounding box falls into a visible region, the window is considered to be visible. Note that a completely transparent window may also be considered visible.

### Occlusion State Creation
