Type Method

# imageUnfilteredPasteboardTypes()

Returns the list of pasteboard types supported directly by the image representation.

macOS 10.0â€“10.10Deprecated

``` source
class func imageUnfilteredPasteboardTypes() -> [NSPasteboard.PasteboardType]
```

Deprecated

Use +imageUnfilteredTypes instead

## Return Value

An array of `NSString` objects. This array is empty by default. Subclasses must override to return the list of pasteboard formats they support.

## Discussion

When creating a subclass of `NSImageRep`, override this method to return a list representing the supported pasteboard types. For example, the `NSBitmapImageRep` class implements code similar to the following for this method:

```
+ (NSArray *)imageUnfilteredPasteboardTypes {
    static NSArray *types = nil;

    if (!types) types = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:NSTIFFPboardType,  nil];
    return types;
}
```

If your subclass supports the types supported by its superclass, you must explicitly get the list of types from the superclass and add them to the array returned by this method.
