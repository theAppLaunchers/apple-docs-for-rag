# NSWorkspace.AuthorizationType.replaceFile

Authorization for the app to perform an atomic file write without changing the target fileâ€™s permissions.

macOS 10.14+

``` source
case replaceFile
```

## Discussion

Signifies that the user has granted authorization for replaceItem(at:withItemAt:backupItemName:options:resultingItemURL:). When you use a FileManager with this authorization, the file manager ignores the `backupItemName` and `options` parameters.
