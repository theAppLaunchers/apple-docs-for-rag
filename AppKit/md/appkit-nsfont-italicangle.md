Instance Property

# italicAngle

The number of degrees that the font is slanted counterclockwise from the vertical.

macOS

``` source
var italicAngle: CGFloat { get }
```

## Discussion

The italic angle value is read from the fontâ€™s AFM file. Because the slant is measured counterclockwise, English italic fonts typically return a negative value.
