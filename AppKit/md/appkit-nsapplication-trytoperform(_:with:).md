Instance Method

# tryToPerform(\_:with:)

Dispatches an action message to the specified target.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func tryToPerform(
    _ action: Selector,
    with object: Any?
) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`action`  

The action message you want to dispatch.

`object`  

The target object that defines the specified selector.

## Return Value

true if either the receiver or its delegate can accept the specified selector; otherwise, false. This method also returns false if `aSelector` is `nil`.

## Discussion

The receiver tries to perform the method `aSelector` using its inherited tryToPerform(_:with:) method of NSResponder. If the receiver doesnâ€™t perform `aSelector`, the delegate is given the opportunity to perform it using its inherited perform(_:with:) method of NSObject.
