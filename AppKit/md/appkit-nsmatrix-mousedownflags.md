Instance Property

# mouseDownFlags

The flags in effect at the mouse-down event that started the current tracking session.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var mouseDownFlags: Int { get }
```

## Discussion

The NSMatrix mouseDown(with:) method obtains these flags by sending a modifierFlags message to the event passed into mouseDown(with:). Use this property if you want to access these flags. This property is valid only during tracking; it isnâ€™t useful if the target of the receiver initiates another tracking loop as part of its action method (as a cell that pops up a pop-up list does, for example).
