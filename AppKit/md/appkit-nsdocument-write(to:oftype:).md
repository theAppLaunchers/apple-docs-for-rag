Instance Method

# write(to:ofType:)

Writes the contents of the document to a file or file package located by a URL, that is formatted to a specified type.

macOS

``` source
nonisolated
func write(
    to url: URL,
    ofType typeName: String
) throws
```

## Parameters 

`url`  

The location to which the document contents are written.

`typeName`  

The string that identifies the document type.

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method just invokes `[self fileWrapperOfType:typeName error:outError]` and writes the returned file wrapper to disk.

For backward binary compatibility with OS X v10.3 and earlier, the default implementation of this method instead invokes `[self writeToFile:[absoluteURL path] ofType:typeName]` if writeToFile:ofType: is overridden and the URL uses the `file:` scheme.

Handling Errors in Swift

In Swift, this method is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure.

When overriding this method, use the `throw` statement to throw an `NSError`, as described in Error Handling in The Swift Programming Language and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.
