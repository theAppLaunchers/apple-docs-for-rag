## Discussion

During the conclusion of an accepted drag, if this property is set to true, the drag manager will animate each dragging image to their NSDraggingFormation.none locations. Otherwise, the drag images are removed without any animation.

This property is inspected between prepareForDragOperation: and performDragOperation:. You should enumerate through the dragging items during performDragOperation: to set the itemâ€™s draggingFrame to the correct destinations.
