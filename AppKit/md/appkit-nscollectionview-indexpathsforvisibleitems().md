Instance Method

# indexPathsForVisibleItems()

Returns the index paths of the currently active items.

macOS 10.11+

``` source
@MainActor
func indexPathsForVisibleItems() -> Set
```

## Return Value

The set of NSIndexPath objects corresponding to the currently visible items.

## Discussion

The index paths returned by this method belong to items that are active and currently being managed by the collection view. As a result, the returned set may include index paths for items that are outside of the collection viewâ€™s actual visible rectangle. For example, it may contain index paths for items that were recently visible but have since been scrolled out of view. To test whether an item is visible, check to see if its frame rectangle intersects the visibleRect of the collection view.
