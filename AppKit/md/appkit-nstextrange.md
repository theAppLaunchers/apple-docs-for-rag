## Overview

An `NSTextRange` consists of the starting and terminating locations. There the two basic properties: `location` and `endLocation`, respectively. The terminating `location`, `endLocation`, is directly following the last location in the range. For example, a location contains a range if `(range.location

convenience init(location: any NSTextLocation)

Creates a new text range at the location you specify.

init?(location: any NSTextLocation, end: (any NSTextLocation)?)

Creates a new text range with the starting and ending locations you specify.

### Characteristics of the text range

var location: any NSTextLocation

Returns the starting location of the text range.

var endLocation: any NSTextLocation

Returns the ending location of the text range.

var isEmpty: Bool

Returns whether the text range is empty.

### Comparing text ranges

func intersection(NSTextRange) -> Self?

Returns the range, if any, where two text ranges intersect.

func intersects(NSTextRange) -> Bool

Determines if two ranges intersect.

func isEqual(to: NSTextRange) -> Bool

Compares two text ranges.

func union(NSTextRange) -> Self

Returns a new text range by forming the union with the text range you provide.

### Finding text within the text range

func contains(any NSTextLocation) -> Bool

Determines if the text location you specify is in the current text range.

func contains(NSTextRange) -> Bool
