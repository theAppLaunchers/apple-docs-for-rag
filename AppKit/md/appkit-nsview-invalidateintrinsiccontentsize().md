Instance Method

# invalidateIntrinsicContentSize()

Invalidates the viewâ€™s intrinsic content size.

``` source
@MainActor
func invalidateIntrinsicContentSize()
```

## Discussion

Call this when something changes in your custom view that invalidates its intrinsic content size. This allows the constraint-based layout system to take the new intrinsic content size into account in its next layout pass.
