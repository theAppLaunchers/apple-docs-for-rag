Instance Property

# supportsAdaptiveImageGlyph

A Boolean value that indicates whether the document supports adaptive images in the input.

macOS 15.0+

``` source
optional var supportsAdaptiveImageGlyph: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

When this property is false, the input system doesnâ€™t allow the text input to contain adaptive images. Set the value of this property to true only if your document supports adaptive images and handles them properly. For more information, see NSAdaptiveImageGlyph.
