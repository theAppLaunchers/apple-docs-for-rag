Function

# NSEnableScreenUpdates()

Enables screen updates.

macOS 10.0â€“10.11Deprecated

``` source
func NSEnableScreenUpdates()
```

Deprecated

As of 10.11 it is not generally necessary to take explicit action to achieve visual atomicity. +\[NSAnimationContext runAnimationGroup:\] and other similar methods can be used when a stronger than normal need for visual atomicity is required. The NSAnimationContext methods do not suffer from the same performance problems as NSEnableScreenUpdates.

## Discussion

Reenables, for all windows of a process, the flushing of drawing operations to the screen that was previously disabled by NSDisableScreenUpdates(). Successive calls to NSDisableScreenUpdates() are placed on a stack and must be popped off that stack by matching calls to this function.
