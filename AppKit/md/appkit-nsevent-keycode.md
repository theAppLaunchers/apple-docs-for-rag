Instance Property

# keyCode

The virtual code for the key associated with the event.

macOS

``` source
var keyCode: UInt16 { get }
```

## Discussion

Raises an `NSInternalInconsistencyException` if sent to a non-key event.

The propertyâ€™s value is hardware-independent. The value returned is the same as the value returned in the `kEventParamKeyCode` when using Carbon Events.
