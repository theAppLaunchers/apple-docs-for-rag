# attributes

A dictionary of additional attributes that describe how to export content as a PDF file.

var attributes: NSMutableDictionary { get }

## Discussion

Although `attributes` is a read-only property, you can modify the mutable dictionary associated with it. Typically, this dictionary contains custom attributes or parameters that are set by a custom accessory view in the PDF panel.
