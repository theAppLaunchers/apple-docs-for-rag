## Discussion

A value that specifies the rendering intent currently used by the graphics context. For possible values, see NSColorRenderingIntent. The rendering intent specifies how Cocoa should handle colors that are not located within the gamut of the destination color space of a graphics context. If you do not explicitly set the rendering intent, and sampled images are being drawn, NSGraphicsContext uses perceptual rendering intent. Otherwise, NSGraphicsContext uses relative colorimetric rendering intent.
