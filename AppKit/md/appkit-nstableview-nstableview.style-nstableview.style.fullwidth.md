# NSTableView.Style.fullWidth

The table view style resolves to a full-width style.

macOS 11.0+

``` source
case fullWidth
```

## Discussion

In a full-width style table, each row spans the entire width of the table. The full-width style also applies a standard horizontal inset between the edges of the table and its first and last columns.
