**Required** Default implementation provided.

## Parameters 

`textField`  

The text field whose suggestions item was highlighted.

## Discussion

The default implementation inserts the itemâ€™s text completion (`textField(_:textCompletionFor:)`) into the control, replacing its existing text. Overriding this method allows you to do a custom behavior instead.
