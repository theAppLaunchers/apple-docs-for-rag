Instance Property

# worksWhenModal

A Boolean value that indicates whether the panel receives keyboard and mouse events even when some other window is being run modally.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var worksWhenModal: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The value of this property is true when the panel receives keyboard and mouse events even when some other window is being run modally; when the value is false, the panel is prevented from receiving events while a modal loop or session is running. By default, the value of this property is false, indicating a panelâ€™s ineligibility for events during a modal loop or session. See How Modal Windows Work for more information on modal windows and panels.
