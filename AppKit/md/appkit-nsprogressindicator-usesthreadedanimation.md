Instance Property

# usesThreadedAnimation

A Boolean that indicates whether the progress indicator implements animation in a separate thread.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var usesThreadedAnimation: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When the value of this property is true, animation of the progress indicator occurs in a separate thread.

If the app becomes multithreaded as a result of an invocation of this method, the appâ€™s performance could become noticeably slower.
