Instance Method

# collectionView(\_:writeItemsAt:to:)

Places the data for the drag operation on the pasteboard.

macOS 10.11â€“10.15Deprecated

``` source
optional func collectionView(
    _ collectionView: NSCollectionView,
    writeItemsAt indexPaths: Set,
    to pasteboard: NSPasteboard
) -> Bool
```

Deprecated

Use -collectionView:pasteboardWriterForItemAtIndexPath: instead

## Parameters 

`collectionView`  

The collection view making the request.

`indexPaths`  

The index paths of the items being dragged.

`pasteboard`  

The pasteboard on which to place the drag data.

## Return Value

true if the drag operation can continue or false if you want to refuse the drag.

## Discussion

You must implement this method or the collectionView(_:pasteboardWriterForItemAt:) method to support drag operations. The collection view calls the collectionView(_:pasteboardWriterForItemAt:) method in preference to this one if both are implemented. If your app supports multi-image drag and drop, you must implement the collectionView(_:pasteboardWriterForItemAt:) method.

The collection view calls this method after it has determined that a drag should begin but before the drag operation has started. Your implementation of this method should do the following:

1.  Declare the pasteboard types you support using the declareTypes(_:owner:) method of the provided `pasteboard` object.

2.  Write data to the pasteboard for each type you declare.

3.  Return true from this method.
