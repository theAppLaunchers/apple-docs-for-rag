Instance Method

# helpRequested(\_:)

Displays context-sensitive help for the receiver if help has been registered.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func helpRequested(_ eventPtr: NSEvent)
```

## Parameters 

`eventPtr`  

An object encapsulating information about the help-request event.

## Discussion

NSWindow invokes this method automatically when the user clicks for help and help has been registered using setContextHelp(_:for:). Otherwise, `NSWindow` passes the message to the next responder. Subclasses are not required to override this method.

Note

Current hardware does not invoke this method and application code should not call it directly. To provide context-sensitive help, use help tags (tooltips). For more information, see macOS Human Interface Guidelines - Help Tags (Tooltips).
