Instance Method

# deselectItems(at:)

Removes the specified items from the current selection.

macOS 10.11+

``` source
@MainActor
func deselectItems(at indexPaths: Set)
```

## Parameters 

`indexPaths`  

The index paths of the items you want to deselect.

## Discussion

Use this method to reduce the current selection. If you want to animate the deselection of the new items, call this method on the collection viewâ€™s animator() proxy object instead. This method does not call any methods of the delegate object when making the selection.
