Enumeration

# NSPageController.TransitionStyle

These constants control the transition style of the page controller.

macOS 10.8+

``` source
enum TransitionStyle
```

## Overview

These transition styles are independent of the delegateâ€™s specification of book or history mode. It is perfectly reasonable to create a history style user interface using the book mode delegate methods. Simply set the transition style appropriately.
