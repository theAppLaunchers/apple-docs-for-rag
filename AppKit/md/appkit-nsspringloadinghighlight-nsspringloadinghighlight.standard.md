# NSSpringLoadingHighlight.standard

A constant that indicates standard highlighting to show the destination supports spring-loading.

case standard
```

## Discussion

Apply light highlighting to the destinationâ€™s user interface. This highlighting style typically provides a subtle visual cue to the user that the destination supports spring-loading and that spring-loading is about to be fully engaged. A brief period of highlighting with this style provides the user with an opportunity to disengage and prevent the spring-loading from occurring.
