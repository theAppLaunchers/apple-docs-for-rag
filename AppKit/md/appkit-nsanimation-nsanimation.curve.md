Enumeration

# NSAnimation.Curve

These constants describe the curve of an animationâ€”that is, the relative speed of an animation from start to finish.

macOS

``` source
enum Curve
```

## Overview

You initialize an `NSAnimation` object using one of these constants with init(duration:animationCurve:) and you can set it thereafter with the animationCurve property.

## Topics

### Constants

case easeInOut

Describes an S-curve in which the animation slowly speeds up and then slows down near the end of the animation. This constant is the default.

case easeIn

Describes an animation that slows down as it reaches the end.

case easeOut

Describes an animation that slowly speeds up from the start.

case linear

Describes an animation in which there is no change in frame rate.
