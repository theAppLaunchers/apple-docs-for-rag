Instance Method

# rowView(atRow:makeIfNecessary:)

Returns a row view at the specified index, creating one if necessary.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
@MainActor
func rowView(
    atRow row: Int,
    makeIfNecessary: Bool
) -> NSTableRowView?
```

## Parameters 

`row`  

The row index.

`makeIfNecessary`  

true if a view is required, false if you want to update properties on a view, if one is available.

## Return Value

An instance, or subclass, of NSTableRowView. Returning `nil` is also valid if `makeIfNecessary` is false and the view did not exist.

## Discussion

This method first attempts to return a currently displayed view in the visible area. If there is no visible view, and `makeIfNecessary` is true, a prepared temporary view is returned. If `makeIfNecessary` is false, and the view is not visible, `nil` is returned.

In general, `makeIfNecessary` should be true if you require a resulting view, and false if you want to update properties on a view only if it is available (generally this means it is visible).

An exception is thrown if `row` falls outside of the number of rows in the table (numberOfRows). The returned result should generally not be held onto for longer than the current run loop cycle. Itâ€™s better to call rowView(atRow:makeIfNecessary:) whenever a view is required.
