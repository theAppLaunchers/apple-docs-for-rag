Instance Property

# cellClass

The subclass of NSCell that the matrix uses when creating new (empty) cells.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var cellClass: AnyClass { get set }
```

## Discussion

The value of this property should be the id of a subclass of NSCell, which can be obtained by sending the `class` message to either the NSCell subclass object or to an instance of that subclass. The default cell class is that set with the class method `setCellClass(_:)`, or NSActionCell if no other default cell class has been specified.

You need to use this property only with matrices initialized with init(frame:), because the other initializers allow you to specify an instance-specific cell class or cell prototype.
