Instance Method

# data(ofType:)

Creates and returns a data object that contains the contents of the document, formatted to a specified type.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func data(ofType typeName: String) throws -> Data
```

## Parameters 

`typeName`  

The string that identifies the document type.

## Return Value

A data object containing the document contents, or, if the data object could not be created, `nil`.

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method throws an exception because at least one of the writing methods (this method, write(to:ofType:), fileWrapper(ofType:), or write(to:ofType:for:originalContentsURL:)) must be overridden.

For backward binary compatibility with OS X v10.3 and earlier, the default implementation of this method instead invokes ``` dataRepresentationOfType:``typeName ``` on `self` if `dataRepresentationOfType:` is overridden.

Handling Errors in Swift

In Swift, this method is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure.

When overriding this method, use the `throw` statement to throw an `NSError`, as described in Error Handling in The Swift Programming Language and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.
