Instance Property

# editedRow

The index of the row being edited.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var editedRow: Int { get }
```

## Discussion

This property does not apply to view-based table views. In a view-based table view, the views are responsible for their own editing behavior. For other tables, the value reflects the index of the row being edited or `â€“1` when there is no editing session in progress.
