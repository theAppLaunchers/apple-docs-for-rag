## Discussion

Popovers are positioned relative to a positioning view and are automatically moved when the location or size of the positioning view changes.

Sometimes it is desirable to position popovers relative to a rectangle within the positioning view. In this case, you must update the `positioningRect` property whenever this rectangle changes.

This property is exposed as a read-only binding.
