## Discussion

This property contains a value of type NSPressureConfiguration, which configures the behavior and progression of the Force Touch trackpad when responding to recognized pressure gestures.

Ideally, you should avoid changing the pressure configuration during recognition, as the gesture may complete before the configuration has time to take effect. If you do need to change the pressure configuration during recognition, call the set() method of pressureConfiguration.

Once the gesture ends or if recognition fails, the pressure configuration resets to the current viewâ€™s pressure configuration, if any, for the remaining duration of the gesture.
