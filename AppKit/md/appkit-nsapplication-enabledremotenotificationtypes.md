Instance Property

# enabledRemoteNotificationTypes

The types of push notifications that the app accepts.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
@MainActor
var enabledRemoteNotificationTypes: NSApplication.RemoteNotificationType { get }
```

## Return Value

A bit mask whose values indicate the types of notifications the user has requested for the app. See NSApplication.RemoteNotificationType for valid bit-mask values.

## Discussion

This property contains a bitmask whose values indicate the types of push notifications that the app requested. You donâ€™t set this property directly. Call the registerForRemoteNotifications(matching:) method to register your app with Apple Push Notification Service and request the notification types your app supports. macOS delivers only notifications of types that the app supports. For a list of possible values, see NSApplication.RemoteNotificationType.

Note

Currently the only notification type supported for non-running apps is the badging of app icons.
