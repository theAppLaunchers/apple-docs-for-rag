Instance Method

# convert(\_:toFamily:)

Returns a font whose traits are as similar as possible to those of the given font except for the font family, which is changed to the given family.

macOS

``` source
func convert(
    _ fontObj: NSFont,
    toFamily family: String
) -> NSFont
```

## Parameters 

`fontObj`  

The font whose traits are matched.

`family`  

The new font family; a generic font name, such as Helvetica or Times.

## Return Value

A font with matching traits and the given family, or `aFont` if it canâ€™t be converted.

## Discussion

This method attempts to match the weight and posture of `aFont` as closely as possible. Italic is mapped to Oblique, for example. Weights are mapped based on an approximate numeric scale of 0 to 15.
