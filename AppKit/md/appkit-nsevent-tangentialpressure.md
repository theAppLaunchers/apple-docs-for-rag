Instance Property

# tangentialPressure

The tangential pressure on the device that generated this event.

macOS

``` source
var tangentialPressure: Float { get }
```

## Discussion

The propertyâ€™s value can range from -1.0 to 1.0. Tangential pressure is also known as barrel pressure. Only some pointing devices support tangential pressure. This method is valid for mouse events with subtype `NSTabletPointEventSubtype` and for `NSTabletPoint` events.
