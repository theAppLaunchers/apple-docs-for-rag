Instance Property

# absoluteY

The absolute y coordinate of a pointing device on its tablet at full tablet resolution.

macOS

``` source
var absoluteY: Int { get }
```

## Discussion

For the coordinate to be valid, this event must be generated by a tablet pointing device (otherwise the property is set to `0`). This property is valid only for mouse events with a subtype of `NSTabletPointEventSubtype` and for events of type `NSTabletPoint`. Use this value if you want to scale from tablet location to screen location yourself; otherwise use the class method mouseLocation or the instance method locationInWindow.
