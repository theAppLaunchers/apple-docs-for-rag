Class

# NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions

An object that specifies how user interface elements resize themselves when space is constrained.

macOS 10.13+

``` source
class NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions
```

## Overview

An instance of NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions contains zero or more options. Because a compression options object behaves like a set, you can use common operations like intersection, union and subtraction to interact with instances and their members.

You can access system-defined options through the class methods detailed in Creating standard options, or you can create your own custom options with the init(identifier:) initializer.

To compare two different compression options objects, use the methods described in the Comparing compression options section.

## Topics

### Creating a compression option

init()

Creates an option object containing no options.

init(options: Set&lt;NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions>)

Creates an option object that represents the union of the supplied options.

init(identifier: String)

Creates an option object with the given identifier string.

init(coder: NSCoder)

Creates an option object from data in an unarchiver.

### Creating standard options

class var hideImages: NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions

An option specifying that views should hide their images.

class var hideText: NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions

An option specifying that views should hide their text.

class var reduceMetrics: NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions

An option specifying that views should reduce their internal metrics.

class var breakEqualWidths: NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions

An option specifying that views should no longer maintain equal width constraints.

class var standardOptions: NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions

An option that represents the union of all standard compression options.

### Comparing compression options

var isEmpty: Bool

A Boolean value that denotes whether the option is empty.

func contains(NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions) -> Bool

Determines whether the supplied compression options are all present in the current instance.

func intersects(NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions) -> Bool

Determines whether the supplied compression options intersect with the current instanceâ€™s options.

### Combining compression options

func union(NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions) -> NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions

Creates a new compression options object representing the union with the provided options.

func subtracting(NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions) -> NSUserInterfaceCompressionOptions

Creates a new compression options object with the supplied options removed.
