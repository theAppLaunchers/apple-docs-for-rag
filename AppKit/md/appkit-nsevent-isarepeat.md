Instance Property

# isARepeat

A Boolean value that indicates whether the key event is a repeat.

macOS

``` source
var isARepeat: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

Contains true if the key event is a repeat caused by the user holding the key down; otherwise, false. Raises an `NSInternalInconsistencyException` if sent to an `NSFlagsChanged` event or other non-key event.
