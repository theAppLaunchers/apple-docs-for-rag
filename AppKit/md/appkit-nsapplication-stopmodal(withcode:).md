Instance Method

# stopModal(withCode:)

Stops a modal event loop, allowing you to return a custom result code.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func stopModal(withCode returnCode: NSApplication.ModalResponse)
```

## Parameters 

`returnCode`  

The result code you want returned from the runModal(for:) or runModalSession(_:) method. The meaning of this result code is up to you.

## Discussion

This method should always be paired with a previous invocation of runModal(for:) or beginModalSession(for:). When runModal(for:) is stopped with this method, it returns the given `returnCode`. In macOS 10.9 and later, you can use this method to stop a runModal(for:) loop outside of an event callback, such as from within a method repeatedly invoked by an Timer object or a method running in a different thread.
