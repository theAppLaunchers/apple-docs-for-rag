Instance Property

# leafKeyPath

The key path used by the tree controller to determine if a node is a leaf key.

macOS

``` source
var leafKeyPath: String? { get set }
```

## Discussion

Specifying a key path for this property is optional. If the tree controller is able to determine that a node is a leaf node, it can disable inserting or adding children to those nodes.
