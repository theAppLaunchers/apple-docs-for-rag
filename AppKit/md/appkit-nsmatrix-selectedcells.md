## Discussion

See the class description for a discussion of the selected cell.

As an alternative to using setSelectionFrom(_:to:anchor:highlight:) for programmatically making discontiguous selections of cells in a matrix, you could first set the single selected cell and then set subsequent cells to be highlighted; afterwards you can access selectedCells to obtain the selection of cells.
