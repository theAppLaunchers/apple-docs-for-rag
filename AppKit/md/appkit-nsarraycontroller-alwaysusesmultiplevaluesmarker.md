Instance Property

# alwaysUsesMultipleValuesMarker

A Boolean value that indicates whether the receiver always returns the multiple values marker when multiple objects are selected

macOS

``` source
var alwaysUsesMultipleValuesMarker: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default is false. Setting to true can increase performance if your application doesnâ€™t allow editing multiple values. This property is observable using key-value observing.
