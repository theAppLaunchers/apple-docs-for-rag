Instance Method

# write(\_:)

Writes the serialized contents of the specified file wrapper to the pasteboard.

macOS

``` source
func write(_ wrapper: FileWrapper) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`wrapper`  

The file wrapper to write to the pasteboard.

## Return Value

true if the data was successfully written, otherwise false.

## Discussion

Writes the serialized contents of the file wrapper `wrapper` to the receiver and declares the data to be of type `NSFileContentsPboardType` and also of a type appropriate for the fileâ€™s extension (as returned by the `NSCreateFileContentsPboardType` function when passed the files extension), if it has one. If `wrapper` does not have a preferred filename, this method raises an exception.
