``` source
@IBOutlet
unowned(unsafe) var findBarContainer: (any NSTextFinderBarContainer)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property must be set to support the find bar.

When the find bar is to be shown, `NSTextFinder` invokes `showFindBarView:` on the `findBarContainer` object, passing the view for the find bar, which it should display somewhere that is associated appropriately with the content being searched.

The `NSScrollView` class implements `NSTextFinderBarContainer` protocol and is the correct place to display the find bar in most circumstances. The container may freely modify the find bar viewâ€™s width and origin, but not its height.

If this property is not set, then the find bar cannot be shown.
