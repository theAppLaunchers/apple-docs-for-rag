Instance Method

# deselectSelectedCell()

Deselects the selected cell or cells.

@MainActor
func deselectSelectedCell()
```

## Discussion

If the selection mode is `NSRadioModeMatrix` and empty selection is not allowed, or if nothing is currently selected, this method does nothing. This method doesnâ€™t redisplay the receiver.
