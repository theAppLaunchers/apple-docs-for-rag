Instance Method

# helpRequested(with:)

Overridden by subclasses to implement specialized context-sensitive help behavior.

macOS 10.0â€“10.11Deprecated

``` source
func helpRequested(with eventPtr: NSEvent)
```

## Parameters 

`eventPtr`  

An NSEvent object representing the event associated with the help request.

## Discussion

Subclasses in their implementation of this method should cause the Help Manager (NSHelpManager) to display the help associated with the menu. Never invoke this method directly.

### Special Considerations

In macOS 10.6 and later this method has no effect. This method may be deprecated in a future release.
