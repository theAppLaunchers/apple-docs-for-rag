Instance Method

# highlightColor(withFrame:in:)

Returns the color the receiver uses when drawing the selection highlight.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func highlightColor(
    withFrame cellFrame: NSRect,
    in controlView: NSView
) -> NSColor?
```

## Parameters 

`cellFrame`  

The bounding rectangle of the receiver.

`controlView`  

The control that manages the cell.

## Return Value

The color the receiver uses when drawing the selection highlight.

## Discussion

You should not assume that a cell would necessarily want to draw itself with the value returned from selectedControlColor. A cell may wish to draw with different a selection highlight color depending on such things as the key state of its `controlView`.
