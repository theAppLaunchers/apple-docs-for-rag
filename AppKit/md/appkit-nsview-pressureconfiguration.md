## Discussion

This property configures the behavior and progression of the Force Touch trackpad when responding to touch input produced by the user when the cursor is over the view.

Changing the value of this property does not affect a pressure event thatâ€™s already active. This property must be set prior to a mouse-down event, for use with future pressure gestures.
