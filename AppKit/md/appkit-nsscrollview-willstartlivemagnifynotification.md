# willStartLiveMagnifyNotification

Posted at the beginning of a magnify gesture.

``` source
class let willStartLiveMagnifyNotification: NSNotification.Name
```

## Discussion

The notification object is the scroll view performing the magnification.

This notification indicates that the magnification property is being changed due to user action. This may be due to the user performing a pinch gesture or a smart zoom gesture. When animating the magnification value yourself via the objectâ€™s animator, this notification is not sent.
