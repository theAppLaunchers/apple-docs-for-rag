Instance Property

# itemAlignment

A setting that specifies the snapping behavior of items in the scrubber.

macOS 10.12.2+

``` source
@MainActor
var itemAlignment: NSScrubber.Alignment { get set }
```

## Discussion

Set the value to something other than NSScrubber.Alignment.none to ensure that an item is aligned with the specified position when the scrubber comes to rest.

The default value is NSScrubber.Alignment.none.
