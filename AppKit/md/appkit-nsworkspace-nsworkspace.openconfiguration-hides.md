Instance Property

# hides

A Boolean value indicating whether you want the app to hide itself after it launches.

macOS 10.15+

``` source
var hides: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value of this property is false, which leaves the app in its default state after launch. Setting the property to true causes the app to hide itself.
