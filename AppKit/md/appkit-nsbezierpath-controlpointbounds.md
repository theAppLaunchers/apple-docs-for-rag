Instance Property

# controlPointBounds

The bounding box of the path, including any control points.

macOS

``` source
var controlPointBounds: NSRect { get }
```

## Discussion

This property contains the rectangle that encloses the receiverâ€™s path. If the path contains curve segments, the bounding box encloses the control points of the curves as well as the curves themselves.
