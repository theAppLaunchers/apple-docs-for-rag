Instance Method

# sendEvent(\_:)

This action method dispatches mouse and keyboard events the global application object sends to the window.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func sendEvent(_ event: NSEvent)
```

## Parameters 

`event`  

The mouse or keyboard event to process.

## Discussion

Never invoke this method directly. A right mouse-down event in a window of an inactive application isnâ€™t delivered to the corresponding `NSWindow` object. Instead, a sendEvent(_:) message with a window number of `0` delivers it to the NSApplication object.
