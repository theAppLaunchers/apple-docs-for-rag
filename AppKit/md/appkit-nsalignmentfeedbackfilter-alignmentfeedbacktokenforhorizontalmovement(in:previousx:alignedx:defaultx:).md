Instance Method

# alignmentFeedbackTokenForHorizontalMovement(in:previousX:alignedX:defaultX:)

Requests a feedback token for the alignment of an object requiring horizontal movement only.

macOS 10.11+

``` source
func alignmentFeedbackTokenForHorizontalMovement(
    in view: NSView?,
    previousX: CGFloat,
    alignedX: CGFloat,
    defaultX: CGFloat
) -> (any NSAlignmentFeedbackToken)?
```

## Parameters 

`view`  

The view (NSView) in which the object was moved.

`previousX`  

The horizontal location (CGFloat) of the object prior to its move.

`alignedX`  

The new horizontal location (CGFloat) of the object if alignment occurs.

`defaultX`  

The current horizontal location (CGFloat) of the object. This is where the user actually moved the object. This location may be offset from the location of the cursor.

## Return Value

If the system determines that the alignment should not occur, a null value is returned. Otherwise, a feedback token of type `NSAlignmentFeedbackToken` is returned.

## Discussion

This method requests a feedback token for the alignment of an object requiring horizontal movement only.

If a feedback token is returned, call performFeedback(_:performanceTime:) to initiate haptic feedback. Then, move the object to its aligned location.

If no feedback token is returned, donâ€™t perform the horizontal alignment or request haptic feedback. Even if this horizontal alignment fails, be sure to check other alignments. For example, a vertical alignment may still be allowed. If no alignments will occur, move the object to its default location.
