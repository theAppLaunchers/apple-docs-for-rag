Instance Property

# controlSize

The size of the cell.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var controlSize: NSControl.ControlSize { get set }
```

## Discussion

Use this property to change the rendered size of the cell and its control. For a list of possible values, see NSControl.ControlSize.

Changing the cellâ€™s control size does not change the font used by the cell. Use the systemFontSize(for:) class method of NSFont to obtain an appropriate font based on the new control size.
