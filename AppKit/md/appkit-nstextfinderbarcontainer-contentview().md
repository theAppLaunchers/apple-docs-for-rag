Instance Method

# contentView()

A view hierarchy that contains all the views which display the contents being searched.

macOS

``` source
optional func contentView() -> NSView?
```

## Return Value

The root view of the content view hierarchy.

## Discussion

This content view defines the view hierarchy to be dimmed during incremental search, if the `NSTextFinder` instanceâ€™s incrementalSearchingShouldDimContentView is true. If this method is not implemented or returns `nil`, then the `NSTextFinder` instance will act as if incrementalSearchingShouldDimContentView is false
