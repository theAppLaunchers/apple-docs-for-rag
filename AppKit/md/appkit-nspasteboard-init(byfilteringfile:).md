Initializer

# init(byFilteringFile:)

Creates a new pasteboard object that supplies the specified file in as many types as possible based on the available filter services.

macOS

``` source
init(byFilteringFile filename: String)
```

## Parameters 

`filename`  

The filename to put on the pasteboard.

## Return Value

The new pasteboard object.

## Discussion

No filter service is invoked until the data is actually requested, so invoking this method is reasonably inexpensive.
