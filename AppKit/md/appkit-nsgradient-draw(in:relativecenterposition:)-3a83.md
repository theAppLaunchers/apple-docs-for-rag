Instance Method

# draw(in:relativeCenterPosition:)

Draws a radial gradient starting at the center of the specified rectangle.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
func draw(
    in rect: NSRect,
    relativeCenterPosition: NSPoint
)
```

## Parameters 

`rect`  

The rectangle to fill.

`relativeCenterPosition`  

The relative location within the rectangle to use as the center point of the gradientâ€™s end circle. Each coordinate must contain a value between -1.0 and 1.0. A coordinate value of 0 represents the center of `rect` along the given axis. In the default coordinate system, a value of -1.0 corresponds to the bottom or left edge of the rectangle and a value of 1.0 corresponds to the top or right edge.

## Discussion

The center point of the starting circle is the same as the center point of `rect`. The radius of the starting circle is 0, resulting in the starting circle being just a point.

The center point of the end circle starts at the center point of `rect` and is modified by the value in the `relativeCenterPosition` parameter. For example, if `relativeCenterPosition` contains the point (1.0, 1.0), the center of the end circle is located in the top-right corner of `rect`. The radius of the end circle is set to the smallest value that ensures `rect` is covered by the end circle.

The gradient formed by this method is clipped to `rect`.
