Instance Method

# selectItems(at:scrollPosition:)

Adds the specified items to the current selection and optionally scrolls the items into position.

macOS 10.11+

``` source
@MainActor
func selectItems(
    at indexPaths: Set,
    scrollPosition: NSCollectionView.ScrollPosition
)
```

## Parameters 

`indexPaths`  

The index paths of the items you want to select.

`scrollPosition`  

The options for scrolling the newly selected items into view. You may combine one vertical and one horizontal scrolling option when calling this method. Specifying more than one option for either the vertical or horizontal directions raises an exception.

## Discussion

Use this method to extend the current selection. If you want to animate the selection of the new items, call this method on the collection viewâ€™s animator() proxy object instead. This method does not call any methods of the delegate object when making the selection.
