Instance Property

# size

The size of the image representation, measured in points in the user coordinate space.

macOS

``` source
var size: NSSize { get set }
```

## Discussion

This size is the size of the image representation when itâ€™s rendered. It is not necessarily the same as the width and height of the image in pixels as specified by the image data, nor must it be equal to the size set for the `NSImage` object that wraps this image representation.

The size of an image representation combined with the physical dimensions of the image data determine the resolution of the image.
