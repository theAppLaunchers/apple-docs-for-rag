Instance Method

# knowsPageRange(\_:)

Returns true if the view handles page boundaries, false otherwise.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func knowsPageRange(_ range: NSRangePointer) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`range`  

On return, holds the page range if true is returned directly. Page numbers are one-basedâ€”that is pages run from one to *N*.

## Discussion

Returns false if the view uses the default auto-pagination mechanism. The default implementation returns false. Override this method if your class handles page boundaries.
