## Discussion

This method also makes a connection to the window server and completes other initialization. Your program should invoke this method as one of the first statements in `main()`; this invoking is done for you if you create your application with Xcode. To retrieve the `NSApplication` instance after it has been created, use the global variable NSApp or invoke this method.
