# NSTableView.Style.inset

The table view style resolves to an inset style.

macOS 11.0+

``` source
case inset
```

## Discussion

In the inset style, each row is inset from the edges of the table, and the row background and selection both adopt a rounded appearance. The inset style also applies standard horizontal and vertical insets around the tableâ€™s columns and rows.
