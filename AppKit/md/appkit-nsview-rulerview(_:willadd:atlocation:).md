Instance Method

# rulerView(\_:willAdd:atLocation:)

Informs the client that `aRulerView` will add the new NSRulerMarker, `aMarker`.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func rulerView(
    _ ruler: NSRulerView,
    willAdd marker: NSRulerMarker,
    atLocation location: CGFloat
) -> CGFloat
```

## Discussion

`location` is the marker’s tentative new location, expressed in the client view’s coordinate system. The value returned by the client view is actually used; the client can simply return `location` unchanged or adjust it as needed. For example, it may snap the location to a grid. This message is sent repeatedly to the client as the user drags the marker.
