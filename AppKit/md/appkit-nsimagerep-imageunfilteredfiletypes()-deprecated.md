Type Method

# imageUnfilteredFileTypes()

Returns the list of file types supported directly by the image representation.

macOS 10.0â€“10.10Deprecated

``` source
class func imageUnfilteredFileTypes() -> [String]
```

## Return Value

An array of `NSString` objects. This array is empty by default. Subclasses must override to return the list of file formats they support.

## Discussion

The returned file types can include encoded HFS file types as well as filename extensions. When creating a subclass of `NSImageRep`, override this method to return a list of strings representing the supported file types. For example, the `NSBitmapImageRep` class implements code similar to the following for this method:

```
+ (NSArray *)imageUnfilteredFileTypes {
    static NSArray *types = nil;

    if (!types) types = [[NSArray alloc]
        initWithObjects:@"tiff", @"gif", @"jpg",  @"bmp", nil];
    return types;
}
```

If your subclass supports the types supported by its superclass, you must explicitly get the array of types from the superclass and put them in the array returned by this method.
