Instance Method

# getGlyphs(in:glyphs:characterIndexes:glyphInscriptions:elasticBits:)

Extracts the information needed to lay out the glyphs in the given glyph buffer from the given glyph range.

macOS 10.3â€“10.13Deprecated

``` source
func getGlyphs(
    in glyphsRange: NSRange,
    glyphs glyphBuffer: UnsafeMutablePointer!,
    characterIndexes charIndexBuffer: UnsafeMutablePointer!,
    glyphInscriptions inscribeBuffer: UnsafeMutablePointer!,
    elasticBits elasticBuffer: UnsafeMutablePointer!
) -> Int
```

## Discussion

The `charIndexBuffer` contains the original characters for the glyphs. Note that a glyph at index 1 is not necessarily mapped to the character at index 1, since a glyph may be for a ligature or accent.

The `inscribeBuffer` contains the inscription attributes for each glyph, which are used to layout characters that are combined together. The possible values are described in the `Constants` section of the NSLayoutManager reference.

The `elasticBuffer` contains a Boolean value indicating whether a glyph is elastic for each glyph. An elastic glyph can be made longer at the end of a line or when needed for justification.

A subclass can override this method to interact with custom glyph storage.
