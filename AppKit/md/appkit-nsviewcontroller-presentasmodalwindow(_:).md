Instance Method

# presentAsModalWindow(\_:)

Presents another view controller as a modal window, also known as an alert.

macOS 10.10+

``` source
@MainActor
func presentAsModalWindow(_ viewController: NSViewController)
```

## Parameters 

`viewController`  

The other view controller to present as a modal window.

## Discussion

This method calls the present(_:animator:) method on `self` (the presenting view controller), and passes a modal window animator to that method.

The presented view controller is the delegate and the content view controller of its window. You can use NSWindowDelegate methods to prevent the closing of the modal window, if needed.

To dismiss the modal window, call the dismiss(_:) method on `self` (the presenting view controller).
