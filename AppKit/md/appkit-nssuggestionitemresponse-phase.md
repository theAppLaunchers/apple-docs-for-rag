## Discussion

Note

This controls whether or not a indeterminate spinner appears by the control and suggestions menu to indicate to the user that there may be any/more/different/updated suggestions coming.

Note

Once a final set of results have been provided, the control will ignore subsequent provisions until the search request changes.
