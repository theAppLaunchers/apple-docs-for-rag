Instance Method

# convert(\_:)

Converts the given font according to the object that initiated a font change, typically the Font panel or Font menu.

macOS

``` source
func convert(_ fontObj: NSFont) -> NSFont
```

## Parameters 

`fontObj`  

The font to convert.

## Return Value

The converted font, or `aFont` itself if the conversion isnâ€™t possible.

## Discussion

This method is invoked in response to an action message such as addFontTrait(_:) or modifyFontViaPanel(_:). These initiating methods cause the font manager to query the sender for the action to take and the traits to change. See Converting Fonts Manually for more information.
