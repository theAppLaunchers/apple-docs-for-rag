Instance Method

# cgImage(forProposedRect:context:hints:)

Returns a Core Graphics image based on the contents of the current image object.

macOS 10.6+

``` source
func cgImage(
    forProposedRect proposedDestRect: UnsafeMutablePointer?,
    context referenceContext: NSGraphicsContext?,
    hints: [NSImageRep.HintKey : Any]?
) -> CGImage?
```

## Parameters 

`proposedDestRect`  

On input, the proposed destination rectangle for drawing the image. If `NULL`, it defaults to the smallest pixel-integral rectangle containing {{0,0}, \[self size\]}. The `proposedDestRect` is in user space in the reference context.

`referenceContext`  

A graphics context.

`hints`  

A dictionary of hints that provide more context for selecting or generating a `CGImage`, and may override properties of the `referenceContext`.

## Return Value

A `CGImageRef`. This may be an existing `CGImage` if one is available. If not, a new `CGImage` is created.

## Discussion

An `NSImage` is potentially resolution independent, and may have representations that allow it to draw well in many contexts. A `CGImage` is more like a single pixel-based representation. This method produces a snapshot of how the `NSImage` would draw if it was asked to draw in the proposed rectangle in the graphics context.

All input parameters are optional. They provide hints for how to choose among existing CGImage objects, or how to create one if there isnâ€™t already a CGImage available. The parameters are only hints.

This method is typically called, not overridden.
