Instance Method

# addConstraint(\_:)

Adds a constraint on the layout of the receiving view or its subviews.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
@MainActor
func addConstraint(_ constraint: NSLayoutConstraint)
```

## Parameters 

`constraint`  

The constraint to be added to the view. The constraint may only reference the view itself or its subviews.

## Discussion

The constraint must involve only views that are within scope of the receiving view. Specifically, any views involved must be either the receiving view itself, or a subview of the receiving view. Constraints that are added to a view are said to be held by that view. The coordinate system used when evaluating the constraint is the coordinate system of the view that holds the constraint.
