Instance Property

# arrangedSubviews

The array of views that the split view arranges as its split panes.

macOS 10.11+

``` source
@MainActor
var arrangedSubviews: [NSView] { get }
```

## Discussion

This array contains a subset of the views in the split viewâ€™s subviews property. The views in this array may appear in a different order than in the subviews array.

If the value of arrangesAllSubviews is true, this array is identical to the subviews array.
