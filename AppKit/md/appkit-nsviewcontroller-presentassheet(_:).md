``` source
@MainActor
func presentAsSheet(_ viewController: NSViewController)
```

## Parameters 

`viewController`  

The other view controller to present as a sheet.

## Discussion

This method calls the present(_:animator:) method on `self` (the presenting view controller), and passes a sheet animator to that method.

The presented view controller is the delegate and the content view controller of its sheet.

To dismiss the sheet, call the dismiss(_:) method on `self` (the presenting view controller).
