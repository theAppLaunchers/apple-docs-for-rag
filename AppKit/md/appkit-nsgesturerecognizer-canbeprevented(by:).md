Instance Method

# canBePrevented(by:)

Overridden to indicate that the specified gesture recognizer can prevent the current object from recognizing a gesture.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func canBePrevented(by preventingGestureRecognizer: NSGestureRecognizer) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`preventingGestureRecognizer`  

The gesture recognizer that can prevent the current object from recognizing its gesture.

## Return Value

true to indicate that `preventingGestureRecognizer` can block the current gesture recognizer from recognizing its gesture, or false if both gesture recognizers can operate simultaneously.

## Discussion

This method enables similar behavior as the gestureRecognizerShouldBegin(_:) and gestureRecognizer(_:shouldRequireFailureOf:) methods of the gesture recognizerâ€™s delegate. Using this method lets you define rules that apply to all instances of your custom gesture recognizer class. For example, a gesture recognizer of a given class might want to prevent instances of the same class from recognizing at the same time.
