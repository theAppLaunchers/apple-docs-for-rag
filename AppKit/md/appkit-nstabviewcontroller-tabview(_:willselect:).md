func tabView(
    _ tabView: NSTabView,

)
```

## Parameters 

`tabView`  

The tab view object whose tab is about to be selected.

`tabViewItem`  

The tab view item that will be selected.

## Discussion

This method is a delegate method called by the NSTabView object when changes occur. Use it to update your UI or perform any tasks before a tab is selected.

If you override this method, you must call `super` at some point in your implementation.
