The component cell that was clicked.

## Discussion

The value returned is generally valid only when the action or double action is being sent.

Note

In OS X v10.5 and earlier the returned value was \[nil\] if no cell had been clicked. In OS X v10.6, the folder of the cell that the user selected is returned instead.
