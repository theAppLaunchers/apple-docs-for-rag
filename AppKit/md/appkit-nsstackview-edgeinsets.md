Instance Property

# edgeInsets

The geometric padding, in points, inside the stack view, surrounding its views.

macOS 10.9+

``` source
@MainActor
var edgeInsets: NSEdgeInsets { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value is `(0, 0, 0, 0)`. Edge insets remain as they are if you change the value of a stack viewâ€™s orientation property or the value of its inherited userInterfaceLayoutDirection property.
