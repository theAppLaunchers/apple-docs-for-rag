Instance Property

# buttonMask

A bit mask identifying the buttons pressed for a tablet event.

macOS

``` source
var buttonMask: NSEvent.ButtonMask { get }
```

## Discussion

Use one or more of the button-mask constants described in `Getting Unicode Values` to determine which of the pointing deviceâ€™s buttons are pressed. This property is valid only for mouse events with a subtype of `NSTabletPointEventSubtype` and for events of type `NSTabletPoint`; otherwise, the property is set to `0`.
