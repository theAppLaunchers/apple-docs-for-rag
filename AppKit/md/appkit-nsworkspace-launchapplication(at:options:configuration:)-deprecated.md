Instance Method

# launchApplication(at:options:configuration:)

Launches the app at the specified URL.

macOS 10.6â€“11.0Deprecated

``` source
func launchApplication(
    at url: URL,
    options: NSWorkspace.LaunchOptions = [],
    configuration: [NSWorkspace.LaunchConfigurationKey : Any]
) throws -> NSRunningApplication
```

Deprecated

Use openApplication(at:configuration:completionHandler:) instead.

## Parameters 

`url`  

The application URL.

`options`  

Options to use when launching the application. See NSWorkspace.LaunchOptions for possible values.

`configuration`  

A dictionary containing the configuration options. This dictionary can be used to pass additional options to the app. The configuration dictionary may be empty, in which case default behavior applies.

## Return Value

If the app is already running, and newInstance is not specified in the `options` dictionary, then a reference to the existing app is returned; otherwise a new application reference is returned. If the application could not be launched, `nil` is returned and the error is specified in `error`.

## Discussion

It is safe to call this method from any thread in your app in macOS 10.6 and later.

Handling Errors in Swift

In Swift, this method returns a nonoptional result and is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure.

You call this method in a `try` expression and handle any errors in the `catch` clauses of a `do` statement, as described in Error Handling in The Swift Programming Language and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.
