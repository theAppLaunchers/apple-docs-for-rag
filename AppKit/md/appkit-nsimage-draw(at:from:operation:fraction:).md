Instance Method

# draw(at:from:operation:fraction:)

Draws all or part of the image at the specified point in the current coordinate system.

macOS

``` source
func draw(
    at point: NSPoint,
    from fromRect: NSRect,
    operation op: NSCompositingOperation,
    fraction delta: CGFloat
)
```

## Parameters 

`point`  

The location in the current coordinate system at which to draw the image.

`fromRect`  

The source rectangle specifying the portion of the image you want to draw. The coordinates of this rectangle are specified in the imageâ€™s own coordinate system. If you pass in `NSZeroRect`, the entire image is drawn.

`op`  

The compositing operation to use when drawing the image. See the NSCompositingOperation constants.

`delta`  

The opacity of the image, specified as a value from 0.0 to 1.0. Specifying a value of 0.0 draws the image as fully transparent while a value of 1.0 draws the image as fully opaque. Values greater than 1.0 are interpreted as 1.0.

## Discussion

The image content is drawn at its current resolution and is not scaled unless the CTM of the current coordinate system itself contains a scaling factor. The image is otherwise positioned and oriented using the current coordinate system.

Unlike the compositeToPoint:fromRect:operation: and compositeToPoint:fromRect:operation:fraction: methods, this method checks the rectangle you pass to the `srcRect` parameter and makes sure it does not lie outside the image bounds.
