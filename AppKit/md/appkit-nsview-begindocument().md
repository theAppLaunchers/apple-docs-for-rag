## Discussion

Note that this method may be invoked in a subthread.

Override it to configure printing related settings. You should store your settings in the object returned by `NSPrintInfo`â€™s shared class method, which is guaranteed to return an instance specific to the thread in which you invoke this method. If you override this method, call the superclass implementation.
