Instance Method

# highlightSelection(inClipRect:)

Highlights the region of the table view in the specified rectangle.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func highlightSelection(inClipRect clipRect: NSRect)
```

## Parameters 

`clipRect`  

The rectangle, in the table view viewâ€™s coordinate system.

## Discussion

This method is invoked before drawRow(_:clipRect:).

NSCell-based table views can override this method to change the manner in which they highlight selections.

Note

This method should not be subclassed or overridden for a view-base table view. Instead, row drawing customization should be done by subclassing NSTableRowView.
