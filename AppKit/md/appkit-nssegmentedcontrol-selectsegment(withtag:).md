Instance Method

# selectSegment(withTag:)

Selects the segment with the specified tag.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func selectSegment(withTag tag: Int) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`tag`  

The tag associated with the desired segment. A tag is an integer value that can be assigned to a segment as a way of identifying it without knowing its position in the control.

## Return Value

true if the segment was selected successfully; otherwise, false.

## Discussion

Typically, you use Interface Builder to specify the tag for each segment. You may also set this value programmatically using the `setTag:forSegment:` method of `NSSegmentedCell`.
