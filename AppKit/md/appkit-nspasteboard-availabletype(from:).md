Instance Method

# availableType(from:)

Scans the specified types for a type that the receiver supports.

macOS

``` source
func availableType(from types: [NSPasteboard.PasteboardType]) -> NSPasteboard.PasteboardType?
```

## Parameters 

`types`  

An array of `NSString` objects specifying the pasteboard types your application supports, in preferred order.

## Return Value

The first pasteboard type in `types` that is available on the pasteboard, or `nil` if the receiver does not contain any of the types in `types`.

## Discussion

You use this method to determine the best representation available on the pasteboard. For example, if your application supports RTFD, RTF, and string data, then you might invoke the method as follows:

```
NSArray *supportedTypes =
    [NSArray arrayWithObjects: NSRTFDPboardType, NSRTFPboardType, NSStringPboardType, nil];
NSString *bestType = [[NSPasteboard generalPasteboard]
    availableTypeFromArray:supportedTypes];
```

If the pasteboard contains RTF and string data, then `bestType` would contain `NSRTFPboardType`. If the pasteboard contains none of the types in `supportedTypes`, then `bestType` would be `nil`.

You must send a types or availableType(from:) message before reading any data from an `NSPasteboard` object. If you need to see if a type in the returned array matches a type string you have stored locally, use the isEqual(to:) method to perform the comparison.
