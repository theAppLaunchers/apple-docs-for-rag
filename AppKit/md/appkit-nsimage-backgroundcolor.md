Instance Property

# backgroundColor

The background color for the image.

macOS

``` source
@NSCopying
var backgroundColor: NSColor { get set }
```

## Discussion

The background color is visible only if the drawn image representation does not completely cover all of the pixels available for the imageâ€™s current size. The background color is ignored for cached image representations; such caches are always created with a white background. Assigning a new background color does not cause the receiver to recache itself.

The default color is transparent, as returned by the clear method of `NSColor`.
