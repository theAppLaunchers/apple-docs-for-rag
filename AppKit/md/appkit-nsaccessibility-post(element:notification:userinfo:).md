## Discussion

Sends `notification` and `userInfo` to any assistive apps that register to receive the notification from the UI object `element` in your app. The system restricts the `userInfo` dictionary values to the same values as it restricts the accessibility attributes. The `userInfo` dictionary can also be `nil` (most accessibility notifications donâ€™t require it).
