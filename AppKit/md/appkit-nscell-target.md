Instance Property

# target

The object that receives the cellâ€™s action messages.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
weak var target: AnyObject? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The value of this property is the object that implements the selector specified by the action property. Set the value of this property to `nil` to stop the delivery of action messages.

The default value of this property is `nil`. Setting the value of this property raises with internalInconsistencyException. Subclasses are expected to override this property as part of their target/action implementation.
