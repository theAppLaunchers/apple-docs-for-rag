Instance Property

The amount of space added around the content of the container to adjust its final size.

```

## Discussion

If the value of a content inset is less than `1.0`, the content inset is fractional. For example, a top content inset of `20.0` adds 20 points of space between the top of the layout and the top of its container. A top content inset of `0.2` adds space equal to 20% of the containerâ€™s height between the top of the layout and the top of its container.
