# hidesOthers

A Boolean value indicating whether you want to hide all apps except the one that launched.

macOS 10.15+

``` source
var hidesOthers: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value of this property is false, which leaves the visibility of other apps unchanged. Setting the property to true hides all apps except the one that launched.
