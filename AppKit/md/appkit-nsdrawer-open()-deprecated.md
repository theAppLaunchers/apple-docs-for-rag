## Discussion

Calling `open` on an open drawer does nothing. You can get the state of a drawer by sending it state. If an edge is not specified, an attempt will be made to choose an edge based on the space available to display the drawer onscreen. If you need to ensure that a drawer opens on a particular edge, use open(on:).
