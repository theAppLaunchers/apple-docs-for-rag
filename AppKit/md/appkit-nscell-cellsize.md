Instance Property

# cellSize

The minimum size needed to display the cell.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var cellSize: NSSize { get }
```

## Discussion

This property contains the smallest cell size (in points) required to draw its contents. If the cell is not a text or image cell, the cell size is set to (`10000`, `10000`). If an image cell does not yet have an associated image, the cell size is NSZeroSize.This method takes into account of the size of the image or text in the cell along with any margin areas required by the cellâ€™s border, if any.
