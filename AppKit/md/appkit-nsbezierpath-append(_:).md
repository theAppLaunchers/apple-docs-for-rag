Instance Method

# append(\_:)

Appends the contents of the specified path object to the path.

macOS

``` source
func append(_ path: NSBezierPath)
```

## Parameters 

`path`  

The path to add to the receiver.

## Discussion

This method adds the commands used to create `aPath` to the end of the receiverâ€™s path. This method does not explicitly try to connect the subpaths in the two objects, although the operations in `aPath` may still cause that effect.
