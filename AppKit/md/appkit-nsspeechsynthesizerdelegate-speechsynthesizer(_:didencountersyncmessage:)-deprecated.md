macOS 10.5â€“14.0Deprecated

``` source
@MainActor
optional func speechSynthesizer(
    _ sender: NSSpeechSynthesizer,
    didEncounterSyncMessage message: String
)
```

## Parameters 

`sender`  

Speech synthesizer informing its delegate of an error.

`message`  

Error message.

## Discussion

The synthesizer calls your synchronization delegate method whenever it encounters a synchronization command embedded in a string. You might use the synchronization delegate method to provide a callback not ordinarily provided.

For example, you might insert synchronization commands at the end of every sentence in a string, or you might enter synchronization commands after every numeric value in the text.

However, to synchronize your application with phonemes or words, it makes more sense to use the built-in phoneme and word delegate methods: speechSynthesizer(_:willSpeakPhoneme:) and speechSynthesizer(_:willSpeakWord:of:).
