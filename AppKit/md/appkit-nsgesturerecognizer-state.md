``` source

var state: NSGestureRecognizer.State { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property conveys where the gesture recognizer is in the recognition process. The default declaration of this property is read-only so that external clients (such as other gesture recognizers) can use the value for informational purposes. Subclasses can redeclare the property as read-write internally. When doing so, you do not need to provide a custom implementation to set the value of the property. This class provides an implementation that detects state transitions and updates the gesture recognizer accordingly.

For more information about the state transitions that can occur in a gesture recognizer, see State Transitions.
