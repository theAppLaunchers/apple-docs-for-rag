Instance Method

# openFile(\_:from:at:in:)

Opens a file using the default app for its type and animates the action using a custom icon.

macOS 10.0â€“10.11Deprecated

``` source
func openFile(
    _ fullPath: String,
    from image: NSImage?,
    at point: NSPoint,
    in view: NSView?
) -> Bool
```

Deprecated

Use open(_:) instead.

## Parameters 

`fullPath`  

The full path to the file.

`image`  

The icon for the file.

`point`  

The point in `aView` at which to display the icon.

`view`  

The view in which to display the icon.

## Return Value

true if the file was successfully opened; otherwise, false.

## Discussion

Use of this method is discouraged. The method currently provides the same behavior as the openFile(_:) method. The Finder provides an animation before opening the file to give the user feedback that the file is to be opened. To provide this animation, `anImage` should contain an icon for the file, and its image should be displayed at `point`, specified in the coordinates of `aView`.

The sending app is deactivated before the request is sent.

It is safe to call this method from any thread in your app in macOS 10.6 and later.
