func write(to url: URL?) throws
```

## Parameters 

`url`  

The URL at which to store the color list. The URL must specify either a directory or file in the file system. Specify `nil` to save the color list to the userâ€™s `~/Library/Colors` directory.

## Discussion

If `url` represents a directory, this method saves the color list in that directory in a file with the name `.clr`, where is the value of the name property. If `url` represents a file, this method saves the color list using the name you provided.
