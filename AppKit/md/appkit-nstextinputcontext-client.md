Instance Property

# client

The owner of this input context. (read-only)

macOS 10.6+

``` source
var client: any NSTextInputClient { get }
```

## Discussion

The client (owner) of the input context, typically an `NSView` instance, retains its `NSTextInputContext` instance. The `NSTextInputContext` instance doesnâ€™t retain its client.
