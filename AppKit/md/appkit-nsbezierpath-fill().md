Instance Method

# fill()

Paints the region enclosed by the path.

macOS

``` source
func fill()
```

## Discussion

This method fills the path using the current fill color and the receiverâ€™s current winding rule. If the path contains any open subpaths, this method implicitly closes them before painting the fill region.

The painted region includes the pixels right up to, but not including, the path line itself. For paths with large line widths, this can result in overlap between the fill region and the stroked path (which is itself centered on the path line).
