Instance Method

# imageDidNotDraw(\_:in:)

Tells the delegate that the image object is unable, for whatever reason, to lock focus on its image or draw in the specified rectangle.

macOS

``` source
nonisolated
optional func imageDidNotDraw(
    _ sender: NSImage,
    in rect: NSRect
) -> NSImage?
```

## Parameters 

`sender`  

The `NSImage` object that encountered the problem.

`rect`  

The rectangle that the image object was attempting to draw.

## Return Value

An `NSImage` to draw in place of the one in `sender`, or `nil` if the delegate wants to draw the image itself.

## Discussion

The delegate can do one of the following:

- Return another `NSImage` object to draw in the senderâ€™s place.

- Draw the image itself and return `nil`.

- Simply return `nil` to indicate that `sender` should give up on the attempt at drawing the image.
