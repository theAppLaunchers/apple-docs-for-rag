# outlineView(\_:writeItems:to:)

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether a drag operation is allowed.

``` source
optional func outlineView(
    _ outlineView: NSOutlineView,
    writeItems items: [Any],
    to pasteboard: NSPasteboard
) -> Bool
```

Deprecated

Use -outlineView:pasteboardWriterForItem: instead

## Parameters 

`outlineView`  

The outline view that invoked the method.

`items`  

An array of the items participating in the drag.

`pasteboard`  

The pasteboard to which to write the drag data.

## Return Value

true if the drag operation is allowed, otherwise false.

## Discussion

Invoked by `outlineView` after it has been determined that a drag should begin, but before the drag has been started.

To refuse the drag, return false. To start a drag, return true and place the drag data onto the `pboard` (data, owner, and so on). The drag image and other drag-related information will be set up and provided by the outline view once this call returns with true.
