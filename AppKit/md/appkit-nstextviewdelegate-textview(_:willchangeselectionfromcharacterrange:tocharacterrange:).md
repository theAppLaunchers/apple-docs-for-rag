Instance Method

# textView(\_:willChangeSelectionFromCharacterRange:toCharacterRange:)

Returns the actual range to select.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
optional func textView(
    _ textView: NSTextView,
    willChangeSelectionFromCharacterRange oldSelectedCharRange: NSRange,
    toCharacterRange newSelectedCharRange: NSRange
) -> NSRange
```

## Parameters 

`textView`  

The text view sending the message. This is the first text view in a series shared by a layout manager, not necessarily the text view displaying the selected text.

`oldSelectedCharRange`  

The original range of the selection.

`newSelectedCharRange`  

The proposed character range for the new selection.

## Return Value

The actual character range for the new selection.

## Discussion

This method is invoked before a text view finishes changing the selectionâ€”that is, when the last argument to a setSelectedRange(_:affinity:stillSelecting:) message is false.

Non-selectable text views do not process any mouse events. If for some reason it is necessary to disallow user selection change in a text view that handles mouse events, this can be achieved by making the text view selectable but implementing this delegate method to disallow selection changes.

### Special Considerations

In macOS 10.4 and later, if a delegate implements this delegate method and not its multiple-selection replacement, textView(_:willChangeSelectionFromCharacterRanges:toCharacterRanges:), then multiple selection is effectively disallowed; attempts to set the selected ranges call the old delegate method with the first subrange, and afterwards only a single selected range is set.
