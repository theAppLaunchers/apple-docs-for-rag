Instance Property

# isReleasedWhenClosed

A Boolean value that indicates whether the window is released when it receives the `close` message.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var isReleasedWhenClosed: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The value of this property is true if the window is automatically released after being closed; false if itâ€™s simply removed from the screen.

The default for `NSWindow` is true; the default for `NSPanel` is false. Release when closed, however, is ignored for windows owned by window controllers. Another strategy for releasing an `NSWindow` object is to have its delegate autorelease it on receiving a windowShouldClose(_:) message.
