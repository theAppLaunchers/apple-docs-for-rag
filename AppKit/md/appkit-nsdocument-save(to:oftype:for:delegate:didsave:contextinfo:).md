Instance Method

# save(to:ofType:for:delegate:didSave:contextInfo:)

Saves the contents of the document to a file or file package located by a URL, that is formatted to a specified type, for a particular kind of save operation.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func save(
    to url: URL,
    ofType typeName: String,
    for saveOperation: NSDocument.SaveOperationType,
    delegate: Any?,
    didSave didSaveSelector: Selector?,
    contextInfo: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?
)
```

## Parameters 

`url`  

The location of the file or file package to which the document contents are saved.

`typeName`  

The string that identifies the document type.

`saveOperation`  

The type of save operation.

`delegate`  

The delegate to which the selector message is sent.

`didSaveSelector`  

The selector of the message sent to the delegate.

`contextInfo`  

Object passed with the callback to provide any additional context information.

## Discussion

When saving is completed, regardless of success or failure, the method sends the message selected by `didSaveSelector` to the `delegate`, with the `contextInfo` as the last argument. The method selected by `didSaveSelector` must have the same signature as:

```
- (void)document:(NSDocument *)document didSave:(BOOL)didSaveSuccessfully  contextInfo:(void  *)contextInfo;
```

The default implementation of this method invokes `[self saveToURL:absoluteURL ofType:typeName forSaveOperation:saveOperation error:&anError]` and, if false is returned, presents the error to the user in a document-modal panel before messaging the delegate.
