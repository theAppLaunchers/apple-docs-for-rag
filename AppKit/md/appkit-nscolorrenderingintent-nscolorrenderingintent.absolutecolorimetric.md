Case

# NSColorRenderingIntent.absoluteColorimetric

Map colors outside of the gamut of the output device to the closest possible match inside the gamut of the output device.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
case absoluteColorimetric
```

## Discussion

This operation can produce a clipping effect, where two different color values in the gamut of the graphics context are mapped to the same color value in the output deviceâ€™s gamut. Unlike the relative colorimetric, absolute colorimetric does not modify colors inside the gamut of the output device.
