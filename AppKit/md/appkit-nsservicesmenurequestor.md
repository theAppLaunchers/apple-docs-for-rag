Protocol

# NSServicesMenuRequestor

A set of methods that support interaction with items users can share through a sharing service.

macOS

``` source
protocol NSServicesMenuRequestor : NSObjectProtocol
```

## Mentioned in 

Supporting Writing Tools via the pasteboard

## Overview

This informal protocol consists of two methods, writeSelection(to:types:) and readSelection(from:). The first method provides data to a remote service, and the second receives any data the remote service might send back. Both respond to messages that are generated when the user chooses a command from the Services menu.

## Topics

Reads data from the pasteboard and uses it to replace the current selection.

func writeSelection(to: NSPasteboard, types: [NSPasteboard.PasteboardType]) -> Bool
