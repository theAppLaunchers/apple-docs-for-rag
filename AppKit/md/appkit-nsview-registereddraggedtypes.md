The array of pasteboard drag types that the view can accept.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var registeredDraggedTypes: [NSPasteboard.PasteboardType] { get }
```

## Discussion

This property contains an array of NSString objects, each of which corresponds to a Uniform Type Identifier. The array elements are in no particular order, but the array is guaranteed not to contain duplicate entries. To register your viewâ€™s drag types, use the registerForDraggedTypes(_:) method.
