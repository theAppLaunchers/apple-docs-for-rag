Instance Method

# tabletProximity(with:)

Informs the receiver that a tablet-proximity event has occurred.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func tabletProximity(with event: NSEvent)
```

## Parameters 

`event`  

An object encapsulating information about the tablet-point event.

## Discussion

Tablet events are represented by `NSEvent` objects of type NSTabletProximity. Tablet devices generate proximity events when the transducer (pointing device) nears a tablet and when it moves away from a tablet. From an event object of this type you can extract information about the kind of device and its capabilities, as well as the relation of this tablet-proximity event to various tablet-point events; see the NSEvent reference for details. The default implementation passes the message to the next responder.
