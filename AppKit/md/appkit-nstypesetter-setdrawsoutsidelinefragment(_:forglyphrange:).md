Instance Method

# setDrawsOutsideLineFragment(\_:forGlyphRange:)

Sets whether the specified glyphs exceed the bounds of the line fragment in which they are laid out.

macOS

``` source
func setDrawsOutsideLineFragment(
    _ flag: Bool,
    forGlyphRange glyphRange: NSRange
)
```

## Parameters 

`flag`  

true if the glyphs in `glyphRange` exceed the bounds of the line fragment in which they are laid out, false otherwise.

`glyphRange`  

The range of the glyphs in question.

## Discussion

This can happen when text is set at a fixed line height. For example, if the user specifies a fixed line height of 12 points and sets the font size to 24 points, the glyphs will exceed their layout rectangles.

A subclass can override this method to interact with custom glyph storage.
