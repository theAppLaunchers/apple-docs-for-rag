Instance Method

# writeRTFD(toFile:atomically:)

Writes the receiverâ€™s text as RTF with attachments to a file or directory at `path`.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func writeRTFD(
    toFile path: String,
    atomically flag: Bool
) -> Bool
```

## Discussion

Returns true on success and false on failure. If `atomicFlag` is true, attempts to write the file safely so that an existing file at `path` is not overwritten, nor does a new file at `path` actually get created, unless the write is successful.
