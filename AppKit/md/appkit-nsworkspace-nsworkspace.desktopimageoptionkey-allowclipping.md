## Discussion

The value is an NSNumber containing a Boolean, which affects the interpretation of Proportional scaling types. When the value is false, the workspace object makes the image fully visible, but it may include empty space on the sides or top and bottom. When the value is true, the image fills the entire screen, but may be clipped. If you donâ€™t specify this key, the workspace assumes a value of false. Non-proportional scaling types ignore this value.
