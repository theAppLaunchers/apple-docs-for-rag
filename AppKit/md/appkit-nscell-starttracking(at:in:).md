Instance Method

# startTracking(at:in:)

Begins tracking mouse events within the receiver.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func startTracking(
    at startPoint: NSPoint,
    in controlView: NSView
) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`startPoint`  

The initial location of the cursor.

`controlView`  

The `NSControl` object managing the receiver.

## Return Value

true if the receiver is set to respond continuously or set to respond when the mouse is dragged, otherwise false.

## Discussion

The `NSCell` implementation of trackMouse(with:in:of:untilMouseUp:) invokes this method when tracking begins. Subclasses can override this method to implement special mouse-tracking behavior at the beginning of mouse trackingâ€”for example, displaying a special cursor.
