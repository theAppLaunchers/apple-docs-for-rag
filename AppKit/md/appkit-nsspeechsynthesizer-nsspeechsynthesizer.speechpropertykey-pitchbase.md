Type Property

# pitchBase

Get or set a synthesizer’s baseline speech pitch.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
static let pitchBase: NSSpeechSynthesizer.SpeechPropertyKey
```

## Discussion

An NSNumber object that specifies the baseline speech pitch. Typical voice frequencies range from around 90 hertz for a low-pitched voice to perhaps 300 hertz for a high-pitched voice. These frequencies correspond to approximate pitch values in the ranges of 30.000 to 40.000 and 55.000 to 65.000, respectively.

This property is used with setObject(_:forProperty:) and object(forProperty:).

Note

The change in speech pitch may not be noticeable until the next sentence or paragraph is spoken.
