Enumeration

# NSImage.DynamicRange

Describes how High Dynamic Range (HDR) image content displays.

macOS 14.0+

``` source
enum DynamicRange
```

## Overview

Use this type to enable or constrain the display of High Dynamic Range (HDR) in an NSImageView. Displaying HDR content in an NSImageView requires that the NSImage has HDR content in the ITU-R 2100 color space and that the output device has Extended Dynamic Range (EDR) capabilities.

## Topics

### Setting the dynamic range

case standard

Restricts the image content dynamic range to the standard range regardless of the actual range of the image content.

case constrainedHigh

Allows for constrained High Dynamic Range (HDR) image content which is useful for mixing HDR and Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content.

case high

Allows image content to use extended dynamic range if it has dynamic range content.

case unspecified

Indicates that the dynamic range treatment of the image is unknown or otherwise unspecified.
