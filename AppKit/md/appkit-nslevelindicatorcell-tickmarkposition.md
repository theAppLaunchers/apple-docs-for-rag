Instance Property

# tickMarkPosition

The placement of tick marks on the level indicator control.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var tickMarkPosition: NSSlider.TickMarkPosition { get set }
```

## Discussion

Use this property to set the position where the control draws tick marks. Regardless of the value in this property, tick marks are not drawn if the value in the numberOfTickMarks property is `0`.

The default value of this property is NSTickMarkBelow, which also corresponds to the value NSTickMarkLeft for vertically oriented level indicators.
