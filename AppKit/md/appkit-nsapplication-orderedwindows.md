Instance Property

# orderedWindows

An array of window objects arranged according to their front-to-back ordering on the screen.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var orderedWindows: [NSWindow] { get }
```

## Discussion

Only windows that are typically scriptable are included in the array. For example, panels are not included. This property is accessed during script command evaluationâ€”for example, while finding the window in the script statement `close the second window`. For information on how your app can return its own array of ordered windows, see application:delegateHandlesKey:.
