## Topics

### Creating a Touch Phase

init(rawValue: UInt)

Creates a new touch phase from the given raw value.

### Constants

static var began: NSTouch.Phase

A finger touched the device. Or, a resting touch transitioned to an active touch and resting touches are not wanted by the view hierarchy.

static var moved: NSTouch.Phase

A finger moved on the device.

static var stationary: NSTouch.Phase

A finger is touching the device, but hasnâ€™t moved since the previous event.

static var ended: NSTouch.Phase

A finger was lifted from the screen. Or, an active touch transitioned to a resting touch and resting touches are not wanted by the view hierarchy.

static var cancelled: NSTouch.Phase

The system cancelled tracking for the touch, as when (for example) the window associated with the touch resigns key or is deactivated.

static var touching: NSTouch.Phase

Matches the began, moved, or stationary phases of a touch.

static var any: NSTouch.Phase
