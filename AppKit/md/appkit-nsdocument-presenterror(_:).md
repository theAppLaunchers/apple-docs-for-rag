Instance Method

# presentError(\_:)

Presents an error alert to the user as a modal panel.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func presentError(_ error: any Error) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`error`  

The error object encapsulating the information to present to the user.

## Return Value

true if error recovery was done; otherwise, false.

## Discussion

This method does not return until the user dismisses the alert and, if the error has recovery options and a recovery delegate, the errorâ€™s recovery delegate is sent an attemptRecovery(fromError:optionIndex:) message.

The `NSDocument` default implementation of this method is equivalent to that of `NSResponder` and treats the shared `NSDocumentController` as the next responder and forwards these messages to it.

The default implementation of this method invokes willPresentError(_:) to give subclasses an opportunity to customize error presentation. You should not override this method but should instead override willPresentError(_:).
