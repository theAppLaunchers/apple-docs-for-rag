Instance Method

# draw(withFrame:in:)

Draws the receiverâ€™s border and then draws the interior of the cell.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func draw(
    withFrame cellFrame: NSRect,
    in controlView: NSView
)
```

## Parameters 

`cellFrame`  

The bounding rectangle of the receiver.

`controlView`  

The control that manages the cell.

## Discussion

This method draws the cell in the currently focused view, which can be different from the `controlView` passed in. Taking advantage of this behavior is not recommended, however.
