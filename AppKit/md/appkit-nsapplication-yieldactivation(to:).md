Instance Method

# yieldActivation(to:)

Explicitly allows another app to make itself active.

@MainActor
func yieldActivation(to application: NSRunningApplication)
```

## Parameters 

`application`  

The app to yield activation state to.

## Mentioned in 

Passing control from one app to another with cooperative activation

## Discussion

Calling this method doesnâ€™t deactivate the yielding app, nor does it activate the app you yield to. For cooperative activation, the other app must request activation in the future by calling activate() or equivalent.
