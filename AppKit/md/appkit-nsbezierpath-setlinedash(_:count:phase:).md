Instance Method

# setLineDash(\_:count:phase:)

Sets the line-stroking pattern for the path.

macOS

``` source
func setLineDash(
    _ pattern: UnsafePointer?,
    count: Int,
    phase: CGFloat
)
```

## Parameters 

`pattern`  

A C-style array of floating point values that contains the lengths (measured in points) of the line segments and gaps in the pattern. The values in the array alternate, starting with the first line segment length, followed by the first gap length, followed by the second line segment length, and so on

`count`  

The number of values in `pattern`.

`phase`  

The offset at which to start drawing the pattern, measured in points along the dashed-line pattern. For example, a phase of 6 in the pattern 5-2-3-2 would cause drawing to begin in the middle of the first gap

## Discussion

For example, to produce a supermarket coupon type of dashed line:

```
array[0] = 5.0; //segment painted with stroke color
array[1] = 2.0; //segment not painted with a color

[path setLineDash: array count: 2 phase: 0.0];
```

In the above example, if you set `phase` to 6.0, the line dash would begin exactly six units into `pattern`, which would start the pattern in the middle of the first gap.
