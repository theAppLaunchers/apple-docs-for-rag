Instance Property

# tilt

The scaled tilt values of the pointing device that generated this event.

macOS

``` source
var tilt: NSPoint { get }
```

## Discussion

This propertyâ€™s value can range from -1.0 to 1.0 for both axes. A negative x-coordinate value indicates a tilt to the left and a positive value indicates a tilt to the right; a negative y-coordinate value indicates a tilt to the top and a positive value indicates a tilt to the bottom. If the device is perfectly perpendicular to the table surface, the values are 0.0 for both axes. This property is valid for mouse events with subtype `NSTabletPointEventSubtype` and for `NSTabletPoint` events.
