Instance Property

# hasNonContiguousLayout

A Boolean value that indicates whether the layout manager currently has any areas of noncontiguous layout.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
var hasNonContiguousLayout: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

There may be times at which there is no noncontiguous layout, such as when layout is complete; this method enables the layout manager to report that to clients.

For more information about noncontiguous layout, see Noncontiguous Layout.
