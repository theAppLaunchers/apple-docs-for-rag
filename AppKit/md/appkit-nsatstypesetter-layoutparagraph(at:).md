## Discussion

The `lineFragmentOrigin` specifies the upper-left corner of line fragment rectangle. On return, `lineFragmentOrigin` contains the next origin. This method returns the next glyph index. Usually itâ€™s the index right after the paragraph separator, but it can be inside the paragraph range if, for example, the end of the text container is reached before the paragraph separator.
