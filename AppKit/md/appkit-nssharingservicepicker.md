# NSSharingServicePicker

A list of sharing services that the user can choose from.

macOS 10.8+

``` source
class NSSharingServicePicker
```

## Overview

An NSSharingServicePicker object presents an interface for sharing one or more items using a specific service. In macOS 12 and earlier, this picker displays a menu with a list of services that someone can use to share the item. In macOS 13 and later, the picker displays a popover with a preview of the item and the list of services. When someone chooses a service, the picker automatically shares the proposed item with that service.

Create a sharing service picker and configure it with a delegate object to monitor interactions. Your delegate must conform to the NSSharingServicePickerDelegate protocol. Present the picker from your interface using the show(relativeTo:of:preferredEdge:) method.
