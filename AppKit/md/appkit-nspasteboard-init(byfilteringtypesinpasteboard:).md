Initializer

# init(byFilteringTypesInPasteboard:)

Creates a new pasteboard object that supplies the specified pasteboard data in as many types as possible based on the available filter services.

macOS

``` source
init(byFilteringTypesInPasteboard pboard: NSPasteboard)
```

``` source
init(byFilteringTypesIn pboard: NSPasteboard)
```

## Parameters 

`pboard`  

The original pasteboard object.

## Return Value

The new pasteboard object. This method returns the object in the `pasteboard` parameter if the pasteboard was returned by one of the `pasteboardByFiltering...` methods. This prevents a pasteboard from being expanded multiple times.

## Discussion

This process can be thought of as expanding the pasteboard, because the new pasteboard generally contains more representations of the data than `pasteboard`.

This method only returns the original types and the types that can be created as a result of a single filter; the pasteboard does not have defined types that are the result of translation by multiple filters.

No filter service is invoked until the data is actually requested, so invoking this method is reasonably inexpensive.
