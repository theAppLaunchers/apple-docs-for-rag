Instance Property

# defaultType

Returns the name of the document type that should be used when creating new documents.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var defaultType: String? { get }
```

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method returns the first Editor type declared by the `CFBundleDocumentTypes` array in the applicationâ€™s `Info.plist`, or returns `nil` if no Editor type is declared. You can override it to customize the type of document that is created when, for instance, the user chooses New in the File menu.
