Instance Method

# contentHuggingPriority(for:)

Returns the priority with which a view resists being made larger than its intrinsic size.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
@MainActor
func contentHuggingPriority(for orientation: NSLayoutConstraint.Orientation) -> NSLayoutConstraint.Priority
```

## Parameters 

`orientation`  

The orientation of the dimension of the view that might be enlarged.

## Return Value

The priority with which the view should resist being enlarged from its intrinsic size in the specified orientation.

## Discussion

The constraint-based layout system uses these priorities when determining the best layout for views that are encountering constraints that would require them to be larger than their intrinsic size.

Subclasses should not override this method. Instead, custom views should set default values for their content on creation, typically to defaultLow or defaultHigh.
