Instance Property

# resolvesAliases

A Boolean that indicates whether the panel resolves aliases.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var resolvesAliases: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When the value of this property is true, dropping an alias on the panel or asking for filenames or URLs returns the resolved aliases. The default value of this property is true. When this value is false, selecting an alias returns the alias instead of the file or directory it represents.
