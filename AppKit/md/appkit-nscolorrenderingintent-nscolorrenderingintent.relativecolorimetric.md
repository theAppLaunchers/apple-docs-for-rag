Case

# NSColorRenderingIntent.relativeColorimetric

Map colors outside of the gamut of the output device to the closest possible match inside the gamut of the output device.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
case relativeColorimetric
```

## Discussion

This operation can produce a clipping effect, where two different color values in the gamut of the graphics context are mapped to the same color value in the output deviceâ€™s gamut. The relative colorimetric shifts all colors (including those within the gamut) to account for the difference between the white point of the graphics context and the white point of the output device.
