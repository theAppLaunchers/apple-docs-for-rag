Instance Method

# insertChild(\_:at:)

Inserts a specified child view controller into the children array at a specified position.

macOS 10.10+

``` source
@MainActor
func insertChild(
    _ childViewController: NSViewController,
    at index: Int
)
```

## Parameters 

`childViewController`  

The child view controller to add to the children array.

`index`  

The index in the children array at which to insert the child view controller. This value must not be greater than the count of elements in the array.

## Discussion

You should instead use the addChild(_:) method unless you want to perform work on child view controllers as you add them. In that case, override this method to perform that work.

If a child view controller has a different parent when you call this method, the child is first be removed from its existing parent by calling the childâ€™s removeFromParent() method.
