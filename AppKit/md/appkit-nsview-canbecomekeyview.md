var canBecomeKeyView: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

When the value of this property is true, the view can become the key view. In order to become the key view, the view must be visible, it must be installed in a window that supports keyboard entry, and the viewâ€™s acceptsFirstResponder method must return true.
