Instance Method

# canClose(withDelegate:shouldClose:contextInfo:)

Determines whether to close the document, prompting the user as needed to choose a course of action.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func canClose(
    withDelegate delegate: Any,
    shouldClose shouldCloseSelector: Selector?,
    contextInfo: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?
)
```

## Parameters 

`delegate`  

The delegate to which the selector message is sent.

`shouldCloseSelector`  

The selector of the message sent to the delegate.

`contextInfo`  

Object passed with the callback to provide any additional context information.

## Discussion

If the document is not dirty, this method immediately calls the `shouldCloseSelector` callback on the specified delegate with true.

If the document is dirty, an alert is presented giving the user a chance to save, not save, or cancel. If the user chooses to save, this method saves the document. If the save completes successfully, this method calls the callback with true. If the save is canceled or otherwise unsuccessful, this method calls the callback with false. This method may be called by shouldCloseWindowController(_:delegate:shouldClose:contextInfo:). It is also called by the `NSDocumentController` method closeAllDocuments(withDelegate:didCloseAllSelector:contextInfo:). You should call it before you call close() if you are closing the document and want to give the user a chance to save any edits. Pass the `contextInfo` object with the callback.

The `shouldCloseSelector` callback method should have the following signature:

```
- (void)document:(NSDocument *)doc shouldClose:(BOOL)shouldClose  contextInfo:(void  *)contextInfo
```
