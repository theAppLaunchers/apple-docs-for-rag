Instance Method

# tabletPoint(with:)

Informs the receiver that a tablet-point event has occurred.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func tabletPoint(with event: NSEvent)
```

## Parameters 

`event`  

An object encapsulating information about the tablet-point event.

## Discussion

Tablet events are represented by `NSEvent` objects of type NSTabletPoint. They describe the current state of a transducer (that is, a pointing device) that is in proximity to its tablet, reflecting changes such as location, pressure, tilt, and rotation. See the NSEvent reference for the methods that allow you to extract this and other information from `event`. The default implementation of `NSResponder` passes the message to the next responder.
