Instance Method

# highlight(\_:withFrame:in:)

Redraws the receiver with the specified highlight setting.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func highlight(
    _ flag: Bool,
    withFrame cellFrame: NSRect,
    in controlView: NSView
)
```

## Parameters 

`flag`  

If true, the cell is redrawn with a highlight; otherwise, if false, the highlight is removed.

`cellFrame`  

The bounding rectangle of the receiver.

`controlView`  

The control that manages the cell.

## Discussion

Note that the `NSCell` highlighting does not appear when highlighted cells are printed (although instances of `NSTextFieldCell`, `NSButtonCell`, and others can print themselves highlighted). Generally, you cannot depend on highlighting being printed because implementations of this method may choose (or not choose) to use transparency.
