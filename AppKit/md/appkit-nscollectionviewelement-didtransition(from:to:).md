Instance Method

# didTransition(from:to:)

Tells the element that the layout object of the collection view changed.

macOS 10.11+

``` source
@MainActor
optional func didTransition(
    from oldLayout: NSCollectionViewLayout,
    to newLayout: NSCollectionViewLayout
)
```

## Parameters 

`oldLayout`  

The collection viewâ€™s previous layout object.

`newLayout`  

The current layout object associated with the collection view.

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method does nothing. Subclasses can override it and use it to finalize any behaviors associated with the change in layouts.

### Special Considerations

In OS X 10.11, this method is never called.
