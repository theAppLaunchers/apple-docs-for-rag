Instance Property

# tickMarkPosition

The position of the tick marks relative to the receiver.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var tickMarkPosition: NSSlider.TickMarkPosition { get set }
```

## Discussion

The value of this property is a constant indicating the position of the tick marks. Possible values are described in NSSlider.TickMarkPosition. The default alignments are `NSTickMarkBelow` and `NSTickMarkLeft`. Setting this property has no effect if no tick marks have been assigned (that is, if numberOfTickMarks is 0).
