Instance Method

# addArrangedSubview(\_:)

Adds the specified view to the end of the arranged subviews list.

macOS 10.11+

``` source
@MainActor
func addArrangedSubview(_ view: NSView)
```

## Parameters 

`view`  

The view to add to the end of the arrangedSubviews array.

## Discussion

The stack view ensures that the arrangedSubviews array is always a subset of its subviews array. This method automatically adds the provided view as a subview of the stack view, if it is not already. If the view is already a subview, this operation does not alter the subview ordering.
