Instance Property

# shouldCascadeWindows

A Boolean value that indicates whether the window will cascade in relation to other document windows when it is displayed.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var shouldCascadeWindows: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Cascading in relation to other document windows means having a slightly offset location so that the title bars of previously displayed windows are still visible. The value of this property is true if the window will cascade in relation to other document windows, false otherwise. The default value is true.
