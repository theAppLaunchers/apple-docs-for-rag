Instance Property

# isLeaf

A Boolean that indicates whether the browser cell is a leaf or a branch cell.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var isLeaf: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When the value of this property is true, the browser cell is a leaf cell.

A branch `NSBrowserCell` has an image near its right edge indicating that more, hierarchically related information is available; when the user selects the cell, the `NSBrowser` displays a new column of `NSBrowserCell` objects. A leaf `NSBrowserCell` has no image, indicating that the user has reached a terminal piece of information; it doesnâ€™t point to additional information.
