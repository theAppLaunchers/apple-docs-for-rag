Instance Property

# outlineTableColumn

The table column in which hierarchical data is displayed.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
unowned(unsafe) var outlineTableColumn: NSTableColumn? { get set }
```

## Discussion

Each level of hierarchical data is indented by the amount specified by the indentationPerLevel property (the default is `16.0`), and decorated with the indentation marker (disclosure triangle) on rows that are expandable. Outline table column data is archived with the rest of the outline viewâ€™s state information.

Attempts to set the value of this property to `nil` are silently ignored.
