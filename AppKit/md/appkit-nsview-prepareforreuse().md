Restores the view to an initial state so that it can be reused.

@MainActor
func prepareForReuse()
```

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method sets the viewâ€™s alpha to `1.0` and its hidden state to false. Subclasses can override this method and use it to return the view to its initial state. Subclasses should call `super` at some point in their implementation.

This method offers a way to reset a view to some initial state so that it can be reused. For example, the NSTableView class uses it to prepare views for reuse and thereby avoid the expense of creating new views as they scroll into view. If you implement a view-reuse system in your own code, you can call this method from your own code prior to reusing them.
