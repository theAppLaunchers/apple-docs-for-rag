``` source
func setDesktopImageURL(
    _ url: URL,
    for screen: NSScreen,
    options: [NSWorkspace.DesktopImageOptionKey : Any] = [:]
) throws
```

## Parameters 

`url`  

A file URL to the image. The URL must not be `nil`.

The screen on which to set the desktop image.

`options`  

The options dictionary may contain any of the keys in NSWorkspace.DesktopImageOptionKey, which control how the image is scaled on the screen.

## Discussion

Instead of presenting a user interface for picking the options, choose appropriate defaults and allow the user to adjust them in the System Preference Pane.

You must call this method from your appâ€™s main thread.

Handling Errors in Swift

In Swift, this method returns `Void` and is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure.

You call this method in a `try` expression and handle any errors in the `catch` clauses of a `do` statement, as described in Error Handling in The Swift Programming Language and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.
