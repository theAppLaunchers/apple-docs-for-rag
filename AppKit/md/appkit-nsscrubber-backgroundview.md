Instance Property

# backgroundView

A view that is displayed behind the scrubber content.

macOS 10.12.2+

``` source
@MainActor
var backgroundView: NSView? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The scrubber manages the layout of the background view to match the size of the content area. If this property is non-`nil`, the value of the backgroundColor property is ignored.

The default value is `nil`.
