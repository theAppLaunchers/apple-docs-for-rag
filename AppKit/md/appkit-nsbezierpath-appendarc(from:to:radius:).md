Instance Method

# appendArc(from:to:radius:)

Appends an arc to the path.

macOS

``` source
func appendArc(
    from point1: NSPoint,
    to point2: NSPoint,
    radius: CGFloat
)
```

## Parameters 

`point1`  

The middle point of the angle.

`point2`  

The end point of the angle.

`radius`  

The radius of the circle inscribed in the angle.

## Discussion

The created arc is defined by a circle inscribed inside the angle specified by three points: the current point, the `fromPoint` parameter, and the `toPoint` parameter (in that order). The arc itself lies on the perimeter of the circle, whose radius is specified by the `radius` parameter. The arc is drawn between the two points of the circle that are tangent to the two legs of the angle.

The arc usually does not contain the points in the `fromPoint` and `toPoint` parameters. If the starting point of the arc does not coincide with the current point, a line is drawn between the two points. The starting point of the arc lies on the line defined by the current point and the `fromPoint` parameter.

You must set the pathâ€™s current point (using the move(to:) method or through the creation of a preceding line or curve segment) before you invoke this method. If the path is empty, this method raises an genericException exception.

Depending on the length of the arc, this method may add multiple connected curve segments to the path.
