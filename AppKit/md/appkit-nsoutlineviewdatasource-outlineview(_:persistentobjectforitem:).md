Instance Method

# outlineView(\_:persistentObjectForItem:)

Invoked by `outlineView` to return an archived object for `item`.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
optional func outlineView(
    _ outlineView: NSOutlineView,
    persistentObjectForItem item: Any?
) -> Any?
```

## Parameters 

`outlineView`  

The outline view that sent the message.

`item`  

The item for which to return an archived object.

## Return Value

An archived representation of `item`. If the item is an archived object, this method may return the item.

## Discussion

When the outline view is saving the expanded items, this method is called for each expanded item, to translate the outline view item to an archived object.

### Special Considerations

You must implement this method if you are automatically saving expanded items (that is, if autosaveExpandedItems returns true).
