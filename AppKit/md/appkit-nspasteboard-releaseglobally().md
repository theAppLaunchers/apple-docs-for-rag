Instance Method

# releaseGlobally()

Releases the receiverâ€™s resources in the pasteboard server.

macOS

``` source
func releaseGlobally()
```

## Discussion

After this method is invoked, no other application can use the receiver.

Important

Although you must call this method to release a temporary, privately named pasteboard to avoid leaks, you should never call it on a standard pasteboard.
