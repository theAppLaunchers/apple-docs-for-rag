Instance Method

# availableFontNames(with:)

Returns the names of the fonts available in the system whose traits are described exactly by the given font trait mask (not the `NSFont` objects themselves).

macOS

``` source
func availableFontNames(with someTraits: NSFontTraitMask) -> [String]?
```

## Parameters 

`someTraits`  

The font traits for which to return font names. You specify the desired traits by combining the font trait mask values described in `Constants` using the C bitwise OR operator.

## Return Value

The names of the corresponding fonts.

## Discussion

These fonts are in various system font directories.

If `someTraits` is 0, this method returns all fonts that are neither italic nor bold. This result is the same one youâ€™d get if `fontTraitMask` were `NSUnitalicFontMask` `|` `NSUnboldFontMask`.
