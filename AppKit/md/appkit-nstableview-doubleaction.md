Instance Property

# doubleAction

The message sent to the table viewâ€™s target when the user double-clicks a cell or column header.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var doubleAction: Selector? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property stores a selector that corresponds to a method of the following form:

```
-(void)myCustomMethod:(id)sender
```

When the user double-clicks a cell or column header, the table calls the specified method of its target object. The default value of this property is nil. If you do not specify a value for this property, the table view begins editing the cell.

The clickedRow and clickedColumn properties allow you to determine which row and column the double-click occurred in or if, rather than in a row, the double-click occurred in a column heading.

Note that if the table view uses Cocoa bindings and the Double Click Target binding is bound, both messages are invoked on their respective targets: First the Cocoa binding message is sent, then the `setDoubleAction:` message.
