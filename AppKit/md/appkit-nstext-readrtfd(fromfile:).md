Instance Method

# readRTFD(fromFile:)

Attempts to read the RTFD file at `path`, returning true if successful and false if not.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func readRTFD(fromFile path: String) -> Bool
```

## Discussion

`path` should be the path for an `.rtf` file or an `.rtfd` file wrapper, not for the RTF file within an `.rtfd` file wrapper.
