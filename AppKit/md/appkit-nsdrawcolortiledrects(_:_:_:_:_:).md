Function

# NSDrawColorTiledRects(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Draws a single-color, bordered rectangle.

macOS

``` source
func NSDrawColorTiledRects(
    _ boundsRect: NSRect,
    _ clipRect: NSRect,
    _ sides: UnsafePointer,
    _ colors: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ count: Int
) -> NSRect
```

## Parameters 

`boundsRect`  

The bounding rectangle (in the current coordinate system) in which to draw. Since this function is often used to draw the border of a view, this rectangle will typically be that viewâ€™s bounds rectangle. Only those parts of `boundsRect` that lie within the `clipRect` are actually drawn.

`clipRect`  

The clipping rectangle to use during drawing.

`sides`  

The sides of the rectangle for which you want to specify custom colors. Each side must have a corresponding entry in the `colors` parameter.

`colors`  

The colors to draw for each of the edges listed in the `sides` parameter.

`count`  

The number of 1.0-unit-wide slices to draw on the specified sides.

## Return Value

The rectangle that lies within the resulting border.

## Discussion

Behaves the same as NSDrawTiledRects(_:_:_:_:_:) except it draws its border using colors from the `colors` array.
