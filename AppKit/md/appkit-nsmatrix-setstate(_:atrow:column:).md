Instance Method

# setState(\_:atRow:column:)

Sets the state of the cell at specified location.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func setState(
    _ value: Int,
    atRow row: Int,
    column col: Int
)
```

## Parameters 

`value`  

The value to assign to the cell.

`row`  

The row in which the cell is located.

`col`  

The column in which the cell is located.

## Discussion

For radio-mode matrices, if `value` is nonzero the specified cell is selected before its state is set to `value`. If `value` is 0 and the receiver is a radio-mode matrix, the currently selected cell is deselected (providing that empty selection is allowed).

This method redraws the affected cell.
