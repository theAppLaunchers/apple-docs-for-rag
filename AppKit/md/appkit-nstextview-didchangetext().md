Instance Method

# didChangeText()

Sends out necessary notifications when a text change completes.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func didChangeText()
```

## Discussion

Invoked automatically at the end of a series of changes, this method posts an didChangeNotification to the default notification center, which also results in the delegate receiving an `NSText` delegate textDidChange(_:) message.

Subclasses implementing methods that change their text should invoke this method at the end of those methods. See Subclassing NSTextView for more information.
