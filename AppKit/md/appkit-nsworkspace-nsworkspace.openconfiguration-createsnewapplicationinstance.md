# createsNewApplicationInstance

A Boolean value indicating whether you want the system to launch a new instance of the app.

macOS 10.15+

``` source
var createsNewApplicationInstance: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When the value of this property is true, the system always launches a new version of the app, even if an existing copy is already running. The default value of this property is false, which causes the system to open the already running app when present.
