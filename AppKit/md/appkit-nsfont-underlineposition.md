Instance Property

# underlinePosition

The baseline offset to use when drawing underlines with the font.

macOS

``` source
var underlinePosition: CGFloat { get }
```

## Discussion

The value in this property is determined by the fontâ€™s AFM file. The value is usually negative, which must be considered when drawing in a flipped coordinate system.
