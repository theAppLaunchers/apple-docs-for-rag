Instance Property

# enclosingScrollView

The nearest ancestor scroll view that contains the current view.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
var enclosingScrollView: NSScrollView? { get }
```

## Discussion

If the current view is not embedded inside a scroll view, the value of this property is `nil`. This property does not contain the current view if the current view is itself a scroll view. It always contains an ancestor scroll view.
