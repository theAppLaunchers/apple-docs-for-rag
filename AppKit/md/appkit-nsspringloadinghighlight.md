Enumeration

# NSSpringLoadingHighlight

A group of constants that indicate a highlighting style for your appâ€™s user interface to display during a spring-loading operation.

macOS 10.11+

``` source
enum NSSpringLoadingHighlight
```

## Overview

The springLoadingHighlight method provides one of these constant values.
