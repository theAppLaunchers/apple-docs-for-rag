Instance Method

# deliverResult()

Delivers the results of the print operation to the intended destination.

macOS

``` source
@MainActor
func deliverResult() -> Bool
```

## Return Value

true if the results were successfully delivered; otherwise, false.

## Discussion

This method may be called to deliver the results to the printer spool or preview application. Do not invoke this method directlyâ€”it is invoked automatically when the print operation is done.
