Type Method

# withUniqueName()

Creates and returns a new pasteboard with a name that is guaranteed to be unique with respect to other pasteboards in the system.

macOS

``` source
class func withUniqueName() -> NSPasteboard
```

## Return Value

The new pasteboard object.

## Discussion

This method is useful for apps that implement their own interprocess communication using pasteboards. Because the lifetime of a unique pasteboard is not related to the lifetime of the creating app, you must release a unique pasteboard by calling releaseGlobally() to avoid possible leaks.
