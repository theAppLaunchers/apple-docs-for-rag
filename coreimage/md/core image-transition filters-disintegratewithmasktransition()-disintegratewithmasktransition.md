# disintegrateWithMaskTransition()

Transitions between two images using a mask image.

iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+macOS 10.15+tvOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
class func disintegrateWithMaskTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIDisintegrateWithMaskTransition
```

## Return Value

The transition image.

## Discussion

This method applies the disintegrate with mask transition filter to an image. The effect transitions from one image to another using the shapes defined by the mask image.

The disintegrate with mask transition filter uses the following properties:

`inputImage`  
The starting image with the type CIImage.

`targetImage`  
The ending image with the type `CIImage`.

`maskImage`  
An image with the type `CIImage`.

`time`  
A `float` representing the parametric time of the transition from start (at time 0) to end (at time 1) as an NSNumber.

`shadowRadius`  
A `float` representing the size of the shadow as a `NSNumber`.

`shadowDensity`  
A `float` representing the strength of the shadow as a `NSNumber`.

`shadowOffset`  
A CGPoint representing the size of the shadow from the mask image.

The following code creates a filter that produces a transition between the input and target images starting in the areaâ€™s outline in the mask image:

func disintergrate(inputImage: CIImage, targetImage: CIImage, maskImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let disintergrateTransition  = CIFilter.disintegrateWithMaskTransition()
    disintergrateTransition.inputImage = inputImage
    disintergrateTransition.targetImage = targetImage
    disintergrateTransition.maskImage = maskImage
    disintergrateTransition.time = 0.5
    disintergrateTransition.shadowRadius = 8
    disintergrateTransition.shadowDensity = 0.65
    disintergrateTransition.shadowOffset = CGPoint(x: 0, y: -1)
    return disintergrateTransition.outputImage!
}
