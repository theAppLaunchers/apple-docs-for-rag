## Discussion

You use a filterâ€™s name to construct key paths to its attributes when the filter is attached to a Core Animation layer. For example, if a CALayer object has an attached `CIFilter` instance whose name is `myExposureFilter`, you can refer to attributes of the filter using a key path such as `filters.myExposureFilter.inputEV`. Layer animations may also access filter attributes via these key paths.

Core Animation can animate this property on a layer.

The default value for this property is `nil`.
