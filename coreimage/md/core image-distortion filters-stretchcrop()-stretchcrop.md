``` source
class func stretchCrop() -> any CIFilter & CIStretchCrop
```

## Return Value

The distorted image.

## Discussion

This method applies the stretch crop filter to an image. This effect distorts an image by stretching an image and then applies the crop extent. If the crop value is 0, the filter only uses stretching. If the value is 1, then the filter only uses cropping.

The stretch crop filter uses the following properties:

`inputImage`  
An image with the type CIImage.

`centerStretchAmount`  
A `float` representing the amount of stretching of the center of the image as an NSNumber.

`size`  
A CGPoint representing the desired size of the output image.

`cropAmount`  
A `float` representing the amount of cropping you apply to achieve the target size as an `NSNumber`.

The following code creates a filter that results in a smaller image thatâ€™s distorted and cropped to be the defined size:

func stretchCrop(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let filter = CIFilter.stretchCrop()
    filter.inputImage = inputImage
    filter.cropAmount = 0.25
    filter.centerStretchAmount = 0.25
    filter.size = CGPoint(
        x: inputImage.extent.width * 2,
        y: inputImage.extent.size.height * 0.8
    )
    return filter.outputImage!
}
