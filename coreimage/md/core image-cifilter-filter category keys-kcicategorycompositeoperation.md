# kCICategoryCompositeOperation

A filter operates on two image sources, using the color values of one image to operate on the other. Composite filters perform computations such as computing maximum values, minimum values, and multiplying values between input images. You can use compositing filters to add effects to an image, crop an image, and achieve a variety of other effects.
