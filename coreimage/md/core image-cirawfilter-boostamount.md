Instance Property

# boostAmount

A value that indicates the amount of global tone curve to apply to the image.

iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+tvOS 15.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
var boostAmount: Float { get set }
```

## Discussion

The value should be in the range of `0...1`. A value of `0` indicates no global tone curve (linear response), and a value of `1` indicates full global tone curve. The default value is `1`.
