## Overview

Note

In macOS 10.13, iOS 11, and tvOS 11 or later, the Vision framework replaces these classes for identifying and analyzing image features. See VNRecognizeTextRequest.

The properties of a `CITextFeature` object identify its corners in image coordinates. Use this class to locate areas of text within an image â€” for example, to extract and perspective-correct those portions of the image before performing your own optical character recognition or other processing tasks.

To detect rectangles in an image or video, choose the CIDetectorTypeText type when initializing a CIDetector object, and use the CIDetectorImageOrientation option to specify the desired orientation for finding upright text.

## Topics

### Locating a Detected Feature

var bounds: CGRect

### Identifying the Corners of a Detected Text Region

var bottomLeft: CGPoint

The lower-left corner of the detected text region, in image coordinates.

var bottomRight: CGPoint
