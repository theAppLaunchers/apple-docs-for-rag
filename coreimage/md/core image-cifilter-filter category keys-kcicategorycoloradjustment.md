# kCICategoryColorAdjustment

A filter that changes color values. Color adjustment filters are used to eliminate color casts, adjust hue, and correct brightness and contrast. Color adjustment filters do not perform color management; ColorSync performs color management. You can use Quartz 2D to specify the color space associated with an image. For more information, see Color Management Overview and Quartz 2D Programming Guide.
