Type Property

# neutralLocation

A key for the neutral position. Use this key to set the location in geometric coordinates of the unrotated output image that should be used as neutral. You cannot query this value; it is undefined for reading. The associated value is a two-element CIVector object that specifies the location (`x`, `y`).
