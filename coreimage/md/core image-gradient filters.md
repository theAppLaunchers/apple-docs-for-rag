# Gradient Filters

Generate linear and radial gradients.

## Topics

### Filters

class func gaussianGradient() -> any CIFilter &amp; CIGaussianGradient

Generates a gradient that varies from one color to another using a Gaussian distribution.

class func hueSaturationValueGradient() -> any CIFilter &amp; CIHueSaturationValueGradient

Generates a gradient representing a specified color space.

class func linearGradient() -> any CIFilter &amp; CILinearGradient

Generates a color gradient that varies along a linear axis between two defined endpoints.

class func radialGradient() -> any CIFilter &amp; CIRadialGradient

Generates a gradient that varies radially between two circles having the same center.

class func smoothLinearGradient() -> any CIFilter &amp; CISmoothLinearGradient

Generates a gradient that blends colors along a linear axis between two defined endpoints.
