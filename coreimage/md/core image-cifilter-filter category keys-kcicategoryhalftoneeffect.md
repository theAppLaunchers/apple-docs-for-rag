# kCICategoryHalftoneEffect

A filter that simulates a variety of halftone screens, to mimic the halftone process used in print media. The output of these filters has the familiar “newspaper” look of the various dot patterns. Filters are typically named after the pattern created by the virtual halftone screen, such as circular screen or hatched screen.
