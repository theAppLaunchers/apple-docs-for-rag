Type Method

# generateSignature(from:completionHandler:)

Creates a signature with the asset you specify.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 9.0+

``` source
class func generateSignature(
    from asset: AVAsset,
    completionHandler: @escaping (SHSignature?, (any Error)?) -> Void
)
```

``` source
class func signature(from asset: AVAsset) async throws -> SHSignature
```

## Parameters 

`asset`  

An asset that contains the audio to convert.

`completionHandler`  

The system calls this completion block after creating the signature, or an error if the system couldnâ€™t create it.

This block takes the following parameters:

`signature`  
A new signature instance.

error  
An error object if a problem occurs when creating thesignature; otherwise, `nil`.

## Discussion

Important

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
class func signature(from asset: AVAsset) async throws -> SHSignature
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

The asset you specify can be any type of media that contains audio tracks. If the asset has multiple tracks, the system mixes them into one SHSignature.
