``` source
class SHMediaItem
```

## Overview

This class uses subscripting for the data elements of a custom media item that an existing property doesnâ€™t already represent.

Add a readable custom property by extending SHMediaItemProperty with a key for that property, and by extending this class with a property that uses the key. The following code shows the extensions for an episode number:

```
// Add an episode number to the list of properties.
extension SHMediaItemProperty {
    static let episode = SHMediaItemProperty("Episode")
}

// Add a property for returning the episode number using a subscript.
extension SHMediaItem {
    var episode: Int? {
        return self[.episode] as? Int
    }
}
```

Add your custom property when you create the media item as the following code shows:

```
// Create a new media item and set the title, subtitle, and episode properties.
let mediaItem = SHMediaItem(properties: [.episode: 42,
                                         .title: "Question",
                                         .subtitle: "The Answer"])
```

Note

The class of the object that represents a custom object must be one of: `Dictionary`, `Array`, `URL`, `Number`, `String`, `Date`, or `Data`.
