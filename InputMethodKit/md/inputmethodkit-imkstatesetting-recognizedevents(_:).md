## Return Value

An unsigned integer that contains a union of event masks (See the `NSEvent.h` header file.

## Discussion

A client calls this method to check whether an input method supports an event. The default implementation returns `NSKeyDownMask`. If your input method handles only key down events, the Input Method Kit provides the default mouse handling. The default mouse-down handling behavior is as follows: If there is an active composition area and the user clicks in the text but outside of the composition area, the Input Method Kit sends your input method a `commitComposition:` message. This happens only for input methods that return only the default valueâ€”`NSKeyDownMask`.
