# storefrontCountryCodes

A list of storefront country codes for limiting the storefronts for a subscription-renewal-date extension.

App Store Server Notifications 2.7+

``` source
[storefrontCountryCode] storefrontCountryCodes
```

## Attributes 

Maximum length: `3`

## Discussion

If you provide a list of storefronts when you call the Extend Subscription Renewal Dates for All Active Subscribers endpoint, the notification returns only those storefronts. If you donâ€™t use the `storefrontCountryCodes`, the subscription-renewal-date extension applies to all storefronts.

For information about providing the list of storefronts, see MassExtendRenewalDateRequest.
