## Discussion

When a customer initiates an in-app purchase, your app may create an appAccountToken(_:) and send it to the App Store. The App Store returns the same value in appAccountToken in the transaction information after the customer completes the purchase.

If youâ€™re using the Original API for In-App Purchase and provide a UUID in the applicationUsername property, then the appAccountToken field contains that value.
