## Parameters 

`rect`  

An MTLScissorRect instance that represents a rectangle that needs to lie completely within the current render attachment.

## Discussion

The rendering pipeline discards any fragments that lie outside the scissor rectangle.

The default scissor rectangle is the same size as the current render attachment, with its origin coordinates in the upper-left corner at `(0, 0)`.

Note

You can change the render passâ€™s scissor rectangle configuration by calling this method again or by calling the setScissorRects(_:) method.
