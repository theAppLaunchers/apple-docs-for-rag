## Discussion

The device object that created this buffer, and the device object passed into this method, must have the same nonzero peer group identifier (peerGroupID). This buffer must use the private storage mode (MTLStorageMode.private).

A remote view doesnâ€™t allocate any storage for the new buffer; it references the memory allocated for the original buffer. You can use remote views only as a source for copy commands encoded by a MTLBlitCommandEncoder. For more information, see Transferring Data Between Connected GPUs.
