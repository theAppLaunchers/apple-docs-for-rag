``` source
func setThreadgroupMemoryLength(
    _ length: Int,
    offset: Int,
    index: Int
)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`length`  

The threadgroup memory length, in bytes.

`offset`  

An integer that represents the location, in bytes, from the start of the buffer at `index` where the threadgroup memory begins.

`index`  

An integer that represents an entry in the buffer argument table.

## Discussion

You can only change the threadgroup memoryâ€™s size between tile dispatches (see dispatchThreadsPerTile(_:)).

Important

Exceeding the threadgroup memory allocation for the render pass can trigger a debug error.
