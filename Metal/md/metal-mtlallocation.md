Simplifying GPU Resource Management with Residency Sets

## Overview

Types that conform to MTLAllocation, including MTLBuffer, MTLTexture, and MTLHeap, have underlying memory. You make their memory *resident*, or GPU-accessible, by adding an allocation to an MTLResidencySet or calling the appropriate method of a command encoder.

See Simplifying GPU Resource Management with Residency Sets for more information.
