## Topics

### Creating Indirect Mapping Arguments

init()

Returns a default data layout for mapping sparse texture regions.

init(regionOriginX: UInt32, regionOriginY: UInt32, regionOriginZ: UInt32, regionSizeWidth: UInt32, regionSizeHeight: UInt32, regionSizeDepth: UInt32, mipMapLevel: UInt32, sliceId: UInt32)

Returns a new data layout for mapping sparse texture regions.

### Specifying Region Origin

var regionOriginX: UInt32

The x coordinate of the region to change, measured in tile coordinates.

var regionOriginY: UInt32

The y coordinate of the region to change, measured in tile coordinates.

var regionOriginZ: UInt32

The z coordinate of the region to change, measured in tile coordinates.

### Specifying Region Dimensions

var regionSizeWidth: UInt32

The width of the region, measured in tile coordinates.

var regionSizeHeight: UInt32

The height of the region, measured in tile coordinates.

var regionSizeDepth: UInt32

The depth of the region, measured in tile coordinates.

### Specifying Texture Location

var mipMapLevel: UInt32

The mipmap to change.

var sliceId: UInt32

The texture slice to change.
