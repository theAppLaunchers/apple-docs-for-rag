``` source
func makeTexture(
    descriptor: MTLTextureDescriptor,
    iosurface: IOSurfaceRef,
    plane: Int
) -> (any MTLTexture)?
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`descriptor`  

An MTLTextureDescriptor instance.

`iosurface`  

An `IOSurfaceRef` instance.

`plane`  

A plane within i`osurface` the method sets as the textureâ€™s underlying data.

## Return Value

A new MTLTexture instance if the method completed successfully; otherwise `nil`.
