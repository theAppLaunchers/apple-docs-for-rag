Confirming which Counters and Counter Sets a GPU Supports

## Overview

This type defines the constants that let a GPU device declare which counter sets it supports.

Important

Some GPUs may only support some of the counters within a counter set.

For more information, see Confirming which Counters and Counter Sets a GPU Supports.
