# Modern Rendering with Metal

Use advanced Metal features such as indirect command buffers, sparse textures, and variable rate rasterization to implement complex rendering techniques.

## Overview

Note

This sample code project is associated with the Metal Enhancements for A13 Bionic tech talk.

### Configure the Sample Code Project

Because this sample app uses indirect command buffers, you can’t run this sample in the Simulator — you need to run it on a device. To run this sample, use one of the following:

- A Mac from mid-2016 and later with macOS 11 and later

- An iPad with A11 Bionic and later using iPadOS 14.1 and later

- An iOS device with A11 Bionic and later using iOS 14.1 and later

- Xcode 12 and later
