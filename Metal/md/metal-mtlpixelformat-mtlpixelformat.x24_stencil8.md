# MTLPixelFormat.x24_stencil8

A stencil pixel format used to read the stencil value from a texture with a combined 24-bit depth and 8-bit stencil value.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.12+

``` source
case x24_stencil8
```

## Discussion

You canâ€™t directly read the stencil value of a texture with the MTLPixelFormat.depth24Unorm_stencil8 format. To read stencil values from a texture with the MTLPixelFormat.depth24Unorm_stencil8 format, create a texture view of that texture using the MTLPixelFormat.x24_stencil8 format, and sample the texture view instead.
