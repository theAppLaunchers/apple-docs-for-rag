**iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS**

``` source
func wait(for fence: any MTLFence)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`fence`  

An MTLFence instance to pause execution on until updated.

## Discussion

Fences maintain order to prevent GPU data hazards as the GPU runs various passes within the same command queue. The encoded resource state commands wait for a pass to update `fence` before running.

The GPU driver evaluates the passâ€™s fences and the commands that depend on them when your app commits the enclosing MTLCommandBuffer.
