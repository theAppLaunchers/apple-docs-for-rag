## Discussion

You must set the attachmentâ€™s `texture` property, choosing an appropriate pixel format for the texture.

- To store color values in an attachment, use a texture with a color-renderable pixel format.

- To store depth values, use a texture with a depth-renderable pixel format, such as MTLPixelFormat.depth32Float.

- To store stencil values, use a texture with a stencil-renderable pixel format, such as MTLPixelFormat.stencil8.
