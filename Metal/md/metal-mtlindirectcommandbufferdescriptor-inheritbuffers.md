var inheritBuffers: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Always set this property explicitly.

If you set the value to true, donâ€™t set buffer arguments when you encode commands into the indirect command buffer. The commands use (inherit) the buffer arguments that you set on the parent encoder.

If you set the value to false, set the buffer arguments when you encode the commands into the indirect command buffer. The commands ignore any buffer arguments set on the parent encoder.
