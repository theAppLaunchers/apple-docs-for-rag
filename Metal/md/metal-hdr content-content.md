# HDR Content

Take advantage of high dynamic range to present more vibrant colors in your apps and games.

## Overview

High dynamic range (HDR) content has a wider range of brightness levels than standard definition content. Certain displays, which macOS refers to as extended dynamic range (EDR) displays, can physically replicate those extra brightness values on a screen. You can use Metal to detect EDR displays and work with HDR content, such as from a video asset or directly from your app.

## Topics

### High Dynamic Range Content

Processing HDR Images with Metal

Implement a post-processing pipeline using the latest features on Apple GPUs.

Displaying HDR Content in a Metal Layer

Bring your high dynamic range (HDR) content to compatible Mac displays.

Determining Support for EDR Values

Check whether a display supports EDR.

Using Color Spaces to Display HDR Content

Use a color space when you don’t need to edit or process the pixel data.

Using System Tone Mapping on Video Content

Use EDR metadata to apply the default system tone mapping to a layer.

Performing Your Own Tone Mapping

Apply your own tone mapping to get the exact behavior you want.

Implementing Tone Mapping on Reference Displays

Detect reference displays and keep your content within the capabilities of the display hardware.
