**iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS**

func update(_ fence: any MTLFence)
```

**Mac Catalyst, macOS**

``` source
optional func update(_ fence: any MTLFence)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`fence`  

An MTLFence instance to update.

## Discussion

Fences maintain order to prevent GPU data hazards as the GPU runs various passes within the same command queue. This encoded command notifies any passes waiting for `fence`.

The GPU driver evaluates the passâ€™s fences and the commands that depend on them when your app commits the enclosing MTLCommandBuffer.
