## Discussion

If the value of this property is non-`nil`, it contains a reference to the MTLTexture object that created this texture. If the texture isnâ€™t a remote view, the value of this property is `nil`.

You can use remote views only as the source for copy commands encoded by a MTLBlitCommandEncoder.
