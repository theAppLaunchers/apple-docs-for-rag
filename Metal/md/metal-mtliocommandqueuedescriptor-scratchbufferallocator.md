## Discussion

Your app can manage an input/output command queueâ€™s scratch memory by an implementing MTLIOScratchBufferAllocator in one of your types, and assigning an instance of it to scratchBufferAllocator. Otherwise, set to `nil` to instruct the input/output command queue to allocate and manage its own scratch buffers.

Note

An input/output command queue uses scratch buffers for memory-intensives tasks, including loading textures and decompressing asset files.
