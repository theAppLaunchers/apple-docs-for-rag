## Discussion

When you create the indirect command buffer, Metal allocates memory for each command it can hold. It must allocate enough memory to hold any command that you might later encode. To save space, specify only the command types you are going to encode in the indirect command buffer.

You canâ€™t combine rendering and compute commands in the same indirect command buffer.
