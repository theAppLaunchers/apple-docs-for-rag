## Discussion

The default value is `nil`.

When you create a Metal library, Metal compiles shader functions into an intermediate representation. When you create the pipeline state object, the GPU compiles this intermediate code.

By providing a set of binary archives, when Metal creates the pipeline state object, it first checks the archives to see if thereâ€™s already a compiled function. If so, Metal uses it instead.

var supportAddingBinaryFunctions: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether you can use the pipeline to create new pipelines by adding binary functions to its callable functions list.
