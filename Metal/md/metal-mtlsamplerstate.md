## Overview

The MTLSamplerState protocol defines the interface for a lightweight object used to encode how a shader or compute kernel should sample a texture. To create a sampler state object:

1.  Create a MTLSamplerDescriptor object.

2.  Set the desired properties of the sampler descriptor, including filtering options, addressing modes, maximum anisotropy, and level-of-detail parameters.

3.  Call the makeSamplerState(descriptor:) method of the MTLDevice object.

(Your app does not define a class that implements the MTLSamplerState protocol.)

You can either release the MTLSamplerDescriptor object or modify its property values and reuse it to create more MTLSamplerState objects. The descriptorâ€™s properties are only used during object creation; once created the behavior of a sampler state object is fixed and cannot be changed.
