## Overview

MTLStructType is part of the reflection API that allows Metal framework code to query details of a struct that is passed as an argument of a Metal shading language function. Donâ€™t create MTLStructType objects directly; instead query the bufferStructType property of a MTLArgument object, or call the structType() method for a MTLStructMember object. To examine the details of the struct, you can recursively drill down the members property of the MTLStructType object, which contains details about struct members, each of which is represented by a MTLStructMember object.

## Topics

### Obtaining Information about Struct Members

var members: [MTLStructMember]

An array of objects that describe the fields in the struct.
