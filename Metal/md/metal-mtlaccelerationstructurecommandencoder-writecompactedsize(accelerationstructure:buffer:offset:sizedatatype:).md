Instance Method

# writeCompactedSize(accelerationStructure:buffer:offset:sizeDataType:)

Encodes a command to calculate the compacted size of an acceleration structure, taking into account the size of the output data.

iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
func writeCompactedSize(
    accelerationStructure: any MTLAccelerationStructure,
    buffer: any MTLBuffer,
    offset: Int,
    sizeDataType: MTLDataType
)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`accelerationStructure`  

The acceleration structure to measure.

`buffer`  

The buffer to write the size into.

`offset`  

An offset, in bytes, where the GPU should write the result.

`sizeDataType`  

The data type of the resulting data.

## Discussion

The GPU writes the compacted size to the buffer, in bytes, using the `sizeDataType` parameter to determine the size of the output data. The compacted size may be smaller than the source acceleration structure.

To compact an acceleration structure, encode a command to get the minimum size. After the command completes, read the size from the buffer and allocate a new acceleration structure with at least that much storage. Then create another encoder and call the copyAndCompact(sourceAccelerationStructure:destinationAccelerationStructure:) method to copy it into the new structure.
