Instance Method

# waitForFence(\_:)

Encodes a command that instructs the GPU to wait until a pass updates a fence.

``` source
func waitForFence(_ fence: any MTLFence)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`fence`  

An MTLFence instance the GPU waits for before running this blit pass.

## Discussion

Fences maintain order to prevent GPU data hazards as the GPU runs various passes within the same command queue. The GPU driver evaluates the fences and the commands that depend on them when your app commits the enclosing MTLCommandBuffer.

Important

For a blit pass that updates and waits for the same fence, you can only call waitForFence(_:) before you call updateFence(_:). Updating a fence before waiting on it within the same encoder can cause GPU deadlock.

The GPU driver evaluates the passâ€™s fences and the commands that depend on them when your app commits the enclosing MTLCommandBuffer.
