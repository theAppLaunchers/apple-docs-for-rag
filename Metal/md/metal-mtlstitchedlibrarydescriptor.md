```

## Overview

An MTLStitchedLibraryDescriptor describes a library of new stitched functions. A *stitched function* is a visible function you create by composing other Metal shader functions together in a function graph.

Configure a stitched library descriptor by assigning an array of one or more MTLFunctionStitchingGraph instances, each describing a stitched function, to the functionGraphs property. Then assign an MTLFunction array that includes all the functions the graphs depend on to the functions property.

Create a stitched library from the descriptor by passing it to the makeLibrary(stitchedDescriptor:) method of an MTLDevice. You can change the descriptor to create other libraries without affecting any existing ones.
