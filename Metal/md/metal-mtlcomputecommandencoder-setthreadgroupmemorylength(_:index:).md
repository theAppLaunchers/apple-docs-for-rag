Instance Method

# setThreadgroupMemoryLength(\_:index:)

Configures the size of a block of threadgroup memory.

iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.11+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+

``` source
func setThreadgroupMemoryLength(
    _ length: Int,
    index: Int
)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`length`  

The size of the threadgroup memory, in bytes. Use be a multiple of `16` bytes.

`index`  

The index in the threadgroup memory argument table using this allocation.

## Discussion

Important

The sum of all threadgroup memory allocations (whether made using this method or directly in the shader) canâ€™t exceed the device limits for threadgroup memory. Check threadgroup memory limits with the staticThreadgroupMemoryLength property.

The `threadgroup` memory space allows for sharing data between multiple threads in a threadgroup, which can be faster than using `device` memory in your kernels. Before using any threadgroup memory, call this method to configure the threadgroup memory argument table. Kernels accessing their arguments from threadgroup memory have the `[[threadgroup]]` attribute.

To learn more about using the threadgroup address space, see the Metal Shading Language Specification section 4.4.
