## Mentioned in 

Sampling GPU Data into Counter Sample Buffers

## Overview

For more context about configuring sample buffer attachments for compute passes, see Sampling GPU Data into Counter Sample Buffers. That article is one of a series in GPU Counters and Counter Sample Buffers about sampling Metal hardware counters for performance measurement.

## Topics

### Configuring the Sample Buffer Attachment

var sampleBuffer: (any MTLCounterSampleBuffer)?

A specialized memory buffer that the GPU uses to store its counter data during aÂ compute pass.

var startOfEncoderSampleIndex: Int

An index within a counter sample buffer that tells the GPU where to store counter data from the start of a compute pass.

var endOfEncoderSampleIndex: Int

An index within a counter sample buffer that tells the GPU where to store counter data from the end of a compute pass.
