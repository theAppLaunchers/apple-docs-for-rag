## Discussion

The GPU writes a 64-bit integer to the visibility result buffer that is the number of samples that passed depth and stencil tests; this can be zero. Counting is not supported by all GPUs. Check the following documents to see whether a GPU family supports *counting occlusion* queries:

- Metal feature set tables (PDF)

- Metal feature set tables (Numbers)
