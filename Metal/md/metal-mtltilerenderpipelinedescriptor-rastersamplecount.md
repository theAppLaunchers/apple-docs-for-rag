## Discussion

The default value is `1`. This value is used only if the pipeline render targets support multisampling. If the render targets donâ€™t support multisampling, then this value must be `1`.

When you create a MTLRenderCommandEncoder, the sampleCount value of all attachments must match this `sampleCount` value. Furthermore, the texture type of all attachments must be MTLTextureType.type2DMultisample.

Support for different sample count values varies by device object. Call the supportsTextureSampleCount(_:) method on a MTLDevice object to determine whether it supports a specific sample count.
