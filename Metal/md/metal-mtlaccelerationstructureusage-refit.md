Type Property

# refit

An option that specifies that you can refit the acceleration structure if the geometry changes.

``` source
static var refit: MTLAccelerationStructureUsage { get }
```

## Discussion

By default, you canâ€™t change an acceleration structure after you create it. Enabling this option allows you to update the acceleration structure if the geometry changes positions. Typically, for refits to work, the change to the geometry must be small.

Enabling this option require Metal to generate a more conservative acceleration structure, which can affect performance.

### Usage Options

static var preferFastBuild: MTLAccelerationStructureUsage

An option that specifies that Metal needs to build the acceleration structure quickly, even if that reduces ray-tracing performance.

static var extendedLimits: MTLAccelerationStructureUsage

A structure usage option that indicates you intend to use larger ray-tracing limits for the acceleration structure.
