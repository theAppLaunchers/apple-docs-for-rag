Instance Method

# setBuffer(\_:offset:index:)

Binds a buffer to the buffer argument table, allowing compute kernels to access its data on the GPU.

``` source
func setBuffer(
    _ buffer: (any MTLBuffer)?,
    offset: Int,
    index: Int
)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`buffer`  

The MTLBuffer instance to bind to the argument table.

`offset`  

The number of bytes to skip in the buffer before the first element of data.

`index`  

The index the buffer binds to in the argument table.

## Mentioned in 

Improving CPU Performance by Using Argument Buffers

## Discussion

For buffers binding to an argument using the `device` address space, align the offset to the data typeâ€™s size. The maximum size for an offset is `16` bytes.

For buffers in the `constant` address space, the minimum alignment depends on the hardware running your app. See the Metal feature set tables (PDF) for information on each Apple GPU family.

Rebinding an already bound buffer causes a Metal error.

### Encoding Buffers

func setBuffer(any MTLBuffer, offset: Int, attributeStride: Int, index: Int)

Binds a buffer with a stride to the buffer argument table, allowing compute kernels to access its data on the GPU.

**Required**

func setBuffers([(any MTLBuffer)?], offsets: [Int], range: Range&lt;Int>)

Binds multiple buffers to the buffer argument table at once, allowing compute kernels to access their data on the GPU.

func setBuffers([(any MTLBuffer)?], offsets: [Int], attributeStrides: [Int], range: Range&lt;Int>)

Binds multiple buffers with data in stride to the buffer argument table at once, allowing compute kernels to access their data on the GPU.

func setBufferOffset(Int, index: Int)

Changes where the data begins in a buffer already bound to the buffer argument table.

**Required**

func setBufferOffset(offset: Int, attributeStride: Int, index: Int)

Changes where the data begins and the distance between adjacent elements in a buffer already bound to the buffer argument table.
