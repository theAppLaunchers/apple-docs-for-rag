Counter sampling is allowed between blit commands in a blit pass.

Sampling GPU Data into Counter Sample Buffers

## Discussion

When a Metal device object supports this sampling boundary, you can call the sampleCounters(sampleBuffer:sampleIndex:barrier:) method on a MTLBlitCommandEncoder to sample the counters between individual blit commands.
