Case

# MTLSamplerMipFilter.linear

If the filter falls between mipmap levels, both levels are sampled and the results are determined by linear interpolation between levels.

## Discussion

Support for linear filtering between mipmaps varies by GPU and the format of the texture being sampled. For example, you canâ€™t use linear filtering on textures with an integer format, and only some device objects support linear filtering for textures with a floating-point format. To determine whether linear filtering is available for a specific texture format, see:

- Metal feature set tables (PDF)

case notMipmapped

The texture is sampled from mipmap level `0`, and other mipmap levels are ignored.

case nearest
