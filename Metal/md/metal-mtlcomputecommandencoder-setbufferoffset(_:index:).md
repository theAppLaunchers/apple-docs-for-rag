Instance Method

# setBufferOffset(\_:index:)

Changes where the data begins in a buffer already bound to the buffer argument table.

iOS 8.3+iPadOS 8.3+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.11+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+

``` source
func setBufferOffset(
    _ offset: Int,
    index: Int
)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`offset`  

Where the data to bind begins, in bytes, from the start of the bound buffer.

`index`  

The argument table entry to change.

## Discussion

Prefer calling this method to unbinding and then rebinding data.

For buffers binding to an argument using the `device` address space, align the offset to the data typeâ€™s size. The maximum size for an offset is `16` bytes.

For buffers in the `constant` address space, the minimum alignment depends on the hardware running your app. See the Metal feature set tables (PDF) for information on each Apple GPU family.

### Encoding Buffers

func setBuffer((any MTLBuffer)?, offset: Int, index: Int)

Binds a buffer to the buffer argument table, allowing compute kernels to access its data on the GPU.

**Required**

func setBuffer(any MTLBuffer, offset: Int, attributeStride: Int, index: Int)

Binds a buffer with a stride to the buffer argument table, allowing compute kernels to access its data on the GPU.

**Required**

func setBuffers([(any MTLBuffer)?], offsets: [Int], range: Range&lt;Int>)

Binds multiple buffers to the buffer argument table at once, allowing compute kernels to access their data on the GPU.

func setBuffers([(any MTLBuffer)?], offsets: [Int], attributeStrides: [Int], range: Range&lt;Int>)

Binds multiple buffers with data in stride to the buffer argument table at once, allowing compute kernels to access their data on the GPU.

func setBufferOffset(offset: Int, attributeStride: Int, index: Int)

Changes where the data begins and the distance between adjacent elements in a buffer already bound to the buffer argument table.

**Required**
