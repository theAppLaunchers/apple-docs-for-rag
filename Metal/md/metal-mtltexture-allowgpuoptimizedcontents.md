Instance Property

# allowGPUOptimizedContents

A Boolean value indicating whether the GPU is allowed to adjust the contents of the texture to improve GPU performance.

## Discussion

The value is set when the texture is created and never changes.

If the value is `true`, Metal is allowed to adjust the textureâ€™s contents to improve GPU performance. For a shared or managed texture, this optimization can cause slower performance when accessing the texture from the CPU. If the value is `false`, CPU reads and writes may be improved at the cost of some GPU performance.
