Instance Method

# waitForFence(\_:before:)

Encodes a command that instructs the GPU to pause before starting one or more stages of the render pass until a pass updates a fence.

``` source
func waitForFence(
    _ fence: any MTLFence,
    before stages: MTLRenderStages
)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`fence`  

An MTLFence instance a pass updates to inform the GPU that it can begin running the applicable stages of the pass.

`stages`  

An MTLRenderStages instance that designates which stages in the render pass apply to `fence`.

## Discussion

Fences maintain order to prevent GPU data hazards as the GPU runs various passes, including render passes, within the same command queue. The render pass waits for a pass to update `fence` (see updateFence(_:after:)) before running any stage in the `stages` parameter.

Important

For a render pass that updates and waits for the same fence, call waitForFence(_:before:) only before calling updateFence(_:after:). Updating a fence before waiting on it within the same encoder can cause GPU deadlock.

The GPU driver evaluates the passâ€™s fences and the commands that depend on them when your app commits the enclosing MTLCommandBuffer.

Apple family GPUs can update and respond to fences on a per-stage basis. That allows those GPUs to run portions of different stages, such as vertex and fragment, at the same time. You can check whether a GPU is in an Apple GPU family with the supportsFamily(_:) method.

### Encoding Resource Synchronization Commands

func updateFence(any MTLFence, after: MTLRenderStages)

Encodes a command that instructs the GPU to update a fence after one or more stages, which signals passes waiting on the fence.

**Required**

func memoryBarrier(resources: [any MTLResource], after: MTLRenderStages, before: MTLRenderStages)

Creates a memory barrier that enforces the order of write and read operations for specific resources.

func memoryBarrier(scope: MTLBarrierScope, after: MTLRenderStages, before: MTLRenderStages)

Creates a memory barrier that enforces the order of write and read operations for specific resource types.
