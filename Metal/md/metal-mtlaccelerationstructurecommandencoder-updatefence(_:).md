# updateFence(\_:)

Encodes a command that instructs the GPU to update a fence, which signals passes waiting on the fence.

``` source
func updateFence(_ fence: any MTLFence)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`fence`  

An MTLFence instance to update.

## Discussion

Fences maintain order to prevent GPU data hazards as the GPU runs various passes within the same command queue. The acceleration structure encoder notifies any passes waiting for `fence`.

The GPU driver evaluates the passâ€™s fences and the commands that depend on them when your app commits the enclosing MTLCommandBuffer.

func waitForFence(any MTLFence)

Encodes a command that instructs the GPU to pause before starting the acceleration structure commands until another pass updates a fence.
