## Topics

### Declaring Command Types to Encode

var commandTypes: MTLIndirectCommandType

The set of command types that you can encode into the indirect command buffer.

### Declaring Command Inheritance

var inheritBuffers: Bool

A Boolean value that determines where commands in the indirect command buffer get their buffer arguments from when you execute them.

var inheritPipelineState: Bool

A Boolean value that determines where commands in the indirect command buffer get their pipeline state from when you execute them.

### Declaring the Maximum Number of Argument Buffers Per Command

var maxVertexBufferBindCount: Int

The maximum number of buffers that you can set per command for the vertex stage.

var maxFragmentBufferBindCount: Int

The maximum number of buffers that you can set per command for the fragment stage.

var maxKernelBufferBindCount: Int

The maximum number of buffers that you can set per command for the compute kernel.
