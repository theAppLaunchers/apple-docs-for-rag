## Topics

### Creating an Instance Descriptor

init()

Creates a default acceleration structure instance.

init(options: MTLAccelerationStructureInstanceOptions, mask: UInt32, intersectionFunctionTableOffset: UInt32, accelerationStructureIndex: UInt32, userID: UInt32, motionTransformsStartIndex: UInt32, motionTransformsCount: UInt32, motionStartBorderMode: MTLMotionBorderMode, motionEndBorderMode: MTLMotionBorderMode, motionStartTime: Float, motionEndTime: Float)

Creates a new acceleration structure instance.

### Specifying the Instance

var accelerationStructureIndex: UInt32

The index of the acceleration structure to use for this instance.

### Specifying Motion Data

var motionStartTime: Float

The start time for the range of motion described by the keyframe data.

var motionEndTime: Float

The end time for the range of motion described by the keyframe data.

var motionStartBorderMode: MTLMotionBorderMode

The mode to use when handling timestamps before the start time.

var motionEndBorderMode: MTLMotionBorderMode

The mode to use when handling timestamps after the end time.

var motionTransformsStartIndex: UInt32

The index for the instanceâ€™s first keyframe motion data.

var motionTransformsCount: UInt32

The number of keyframes for this instance.

### Customizing Intersection and Hit Tests for the Instance

var intersectionFunctionTableOffset: UInt32

An offset used to determine which function in the intersection function table Metal should call when testing a ray against this instance.

var options: MTLAccelerationStructureInstanceOptions

The options for this instance.

var mask: UInt32

A mask used for this instance when testing a ray against the geometry.

### Specifying the User Identifier

var userID: UInt32

The user identifier for the instance.
