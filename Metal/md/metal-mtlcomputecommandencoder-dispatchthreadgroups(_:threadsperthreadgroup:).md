Instance Method

# dispatchThreadgroups(\_:threadsPerThreadgroup:)

Encodes a compute dispatch command using a grid aligned to threadgroup boundaries.

``` source
func dispatchThreadgroups(
    _ threadgroupsPerGrid: MTLSize,
    threadsPerThreadgroup: MTLSize
)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`threadgroupsPerGrid`  

An MTLSize instance that represents the number of threads for each grid dimension.

`threadsPerThreadgroup`  

An MTLSize instance that represents the number of threads in a threadgroup.

Tip

Prefer using dispatchThreads for your kernel calls on `Apple4` and later Apple GPUs. See Metal Feature Set Tables (PDF) for information on hardware support.

Metal calculates the number of threads in a grid by multiplying `threadsPerThreadgroup` by `threadgroupsPerGrid`.

If the size of your data doesnâ€™t match the size of the grid, perform boundary checks in your compute function to avoid accessing data out of bounds. See Calculating Threadgroup and Grid Sizes for an example.
