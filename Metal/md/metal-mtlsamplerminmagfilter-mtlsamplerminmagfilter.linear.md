## Discussion

Support for linear filtering varies by GPU and the format of the texture being sampled. For example, you canâ€™t use linear filtering on textures with an integer format, and only some device objects support linear filtering for textures with a floating-point format. To determine whether linear filtering is available for a specific texture format, see:

- Metal feature set tables (PDF)
