# Work Submission

Create queues that submit work to the GPU or load assets into GPU resources, and indirect command buffers that group your frequent commands together.

## Topics

### Creating Command Queues

Command queues encode and submit work to the GPU, which include render, compute, and blit passes.

func makeCommandQueue() -> (any MTLCommandQueue)?

Creates a queue you use to submit rendering and computation commands to a GPU.

**Required**

func makeCommandQueue(maxCommandBufferCount: Int) -> (any MTLCommandQueue)?

Creates a queue you use to submit rendering and computation commands to a GPU that has a fixed number of uncompleted command buffers.

**Required**

### Creating Residency Sets

A residency set makes a group of resources, such as buffers, textures, and heaps, accessible to a GPU for your command buffers and their shaders.

func makeResidencySet(descriptor: MTLResidencySetDescriptor) throws -> any MTLResidencySet

Creates a residency set, which can move resources in and out of memory residency.

**Required**

### Creating I/O Command Queues

Input/Output command queues load assets from the file system into textures, GPU buffers, and traditional CPU buffers.

func makeIOCommandQueue(descriptor: MTLIOCommandQueueDescriptor) throws -> any MTLIOCommandQueue

Creates an input/output command queue you use to submit commands that load assets from the file system into GPU resources or system memory.

**Required**

### Creating I/O File Handles

Input/Output file handles each represent an asset in the file system that an I/O command queue loads into a resource for your app.

func makeIOFileHandle(url: URL) throws -> any MTLIOFileHandle

Creates an input/output file handle instance that represents a file at a URL.

**Required**

func makeIOFileHandle(url: URL, compressionMethod: MTLIOCompressionMethod) throws -> any MTLIOFileHandle

Creates an input/output file handle instance that represents a compressed file at a URL.

**Required**

func makeIOHandle(url: URL) throws -> any MTLIOFileHandle

Creates an input/output file handle instance that represents a file at a URL.

**Required**

Deprecated

func makeIOHandle(url: URL, compressionMethod: MTLIOCompressionMethod) throws -> any MTLIOFileHandle

Creates an input/output file handle instance that represents a compressed file at a URL.

**Required**

Deprecated

### Creating Indirect Command Buffers

Indirect command buffers (ICBs) store commands that you can reuse throughout your appâ€™s lifetime, instead of encoding the same commands repeatedly.

func makeIndirectCommandBuffer(descriptor: MTLIndirectCommandBufferDescriptor, maxCommandCount: Int, options: MTLResourceOptions) -> (any MTLIndirectCommandBuffer)?

Creates an indirect command buffer instance.

**Required**
