Instance Property

# swizzle

The pattern you want the GPU to apply to pixels when you read or sample pixels from the texture.

iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.15+tvOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
var swizzle: MTLTextureSwizzleChannels { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value does not apply a transformation to pixels sampled or read from the texture.
