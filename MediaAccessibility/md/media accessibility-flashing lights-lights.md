# Flashing lights

Detect, mitigate, and inform people about flashing lights in media content.

## Overview

People might want to avoid bright, frequent flashes of light in the media they consume. The Dim Flashing Lights setting allows the system to calculate, mitigate, and inform people about flashing lights in a piece of media.

In your app, respond to changes in the Dim Flashing Lights setting to create an enjoyable media-viewing experience for people who choose to reduce flashing lights on their devices. To respond to changes in this setting, register for the notification kMADimFlashingLightsChangedNotification.

```
```

When the Dim Flashing Lights setting changes, update your UI accordingly. For example, when a person enables this setting on the device:

- If you have a custom media-timeline viewer, update the timeline viewer to indicate the strength of the flashing lights in the media content.

- If you have separate media assets for content without flashing lights, play the content without flashing lights and inform the viewer when the content starts.

- If you have an animation sequence with flashing lights in a game or app that you can control programmatically, adjust the animation accordingly.

Check the value of the Dim Flashing Lights setting at any time by using MADimFlashingLightsEnabled().

```
```
