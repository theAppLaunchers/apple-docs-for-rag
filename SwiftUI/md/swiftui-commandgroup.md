## Overview

In macOS, SwiftUI realizes command groups as collections of menu items in a menu bar menu. In iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS, SwiftUI creates key commands for each of a groupâ€™s commands that has a keyboard shortcut.

## Topics

### Creating a command group

init(after: CommandGroupPlacement, addition: () -> Content)

A value describing the addition of the given views to the end of the indicated group.

init(before: CommandGroupPlacement, addition: () -> Content)

A value describing the addition of the given views to the beginning of the indicated group.

init(replacing: CommandGroupPlacement, addition: () -> Content)

A value describing the complete replacement of the contents of the indicated group with the given views.

### Defining commands

func commands&lt;Content>(content: () -> Content) -> some Scene

Adds commands to the scene.

func commandsRemoved() -> some Scene

Removes all commands defined by the modified scene.

func commandsReplaced&lt;Content>(content: () -> Content) -> some Scene

Replaces all commands defined by the modified scene with the commands from the builder.

protocol Commands

Conforming types represent a group of related commands that can be exposed to the user via the main menu on macOS and key commands on iOS.

struct CommandMenu

Command menus are stand-alone, top-level containers for controls that perform related, app-specific commands.

struct CommandsBuilder

Constructs command sets from multi-expression closures. Like `ViewBuilder`, it supports up to ten expressions in the closure body.

struct CommandGroupPlacement

The standard locations that you can place new command groups relative to.
