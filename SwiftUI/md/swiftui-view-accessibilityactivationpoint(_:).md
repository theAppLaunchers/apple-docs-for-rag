## Discussion

Use this modifier to ensure that the activation point for a small element remains accurate even if you present a larger version of the element to VoiceOver.

If an activation point is not provided, an activation point will be derrived from one of the accessibility elements decendents or from the center of the accessibility frame.

The modifier accepts an optional `AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions` option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.

struct AccessibilityZoomGestureAction
