``` source
init(
    sections view: Base,
    @ViewBuilder transform: @escaping (SectionCollection) -> Result
) where Content == GroupSectionsOfContent, Base : View, Result : View
```

## Parameters 

`view`  

The view to extract the sections of.

## Discussion

Sections are constructed lazily, on demand, so access only as much of this collection as is necessary to create the resulting content.

```
struct SectionedStack: View {
    var content: Content

    init(@ViewBuilder content: () -> Content) {
        self.content = content()
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Group(sections: content) { sections in
                ForEach(sections) { section in
                    SectionChrome {
                        section.content
                    } header: {
                        section.header
                    } footer: {
                        section.footer
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This can then be used by creating a `SectionedStack` with itâ€™s view builder-based initializer.

```
SectionedStack {
    Section("Header A") {
        Text("Hello")
        Text("World")
    } footer: {
        Text("Footer A")
    }
    Section("Header B") {
        Text("Foo")
        Text("Bar")
    } footer: {
        Text("Footer B")
    }
}
```

Any content of the given view which is not explicitly specified as a section is grouped with its sibling content to form implicit sections, meaning the minimum number of sections in a `SectionCollection` is one. For example in the following `SectionedStack`, there is one explicit section, and two implicit sections containing the content before, and after the explicit section:

```
SectionedStack {
    Text("First implicit section")
    Section("Explicit section") {
        Text("Content")
    }
    Text("Second implicit section")
}
```
