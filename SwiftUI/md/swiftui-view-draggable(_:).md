```

## Parameters

## Mentioned in 

Making a view into a drag source

## Discussion

Applying the `draggable(_:)` modifier adds the appropriate gestures for drag and drop to this view. When a drag operation begins, a rendering of this view is generated and used as the preview image.

To customize the default preview, apply a contentShape(_:_:eoFill:) with a dragPreview kind. For example, you can change the previewâ€™s corner radius or use a nested view as the preview.
