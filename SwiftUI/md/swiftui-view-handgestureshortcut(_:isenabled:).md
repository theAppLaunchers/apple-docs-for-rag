iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+tvOS 18.0+watchOS 11.0+

``` source
nonisolated
func handGestureShortcut(
    _ shortcut: HandGestureShortcut,
    isEnabled: Bool = true
) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`shortcut`  

The shortcut to associate with this control.

`isEnabled`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the shortcut is is enabled for this control.

## Discussion

Performing the controlâ€™s shortcut while the control is anywhere in the frontmost scene is equivalent to direct interaction with the control to perform its primary action.

The following example lets users of a watchOS music app toggle playback by double-tapping their thumb and index finger together:

```
struct PlaybackControls: View {
    let model: TrackModel

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Button("Skip Back") {
                model.skipBack()
            }

            Button("Play/Pause") {
                model.playPause()
            }
            .handGestureShortcut(.primaryAction)

            Button("Skip Forward") {
                model.skipForward()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The target of a hand gesture shortcut is resolved in a leading-to-trailing traversal of the active scene.
