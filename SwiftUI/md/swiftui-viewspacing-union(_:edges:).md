``` source
func union(
    _ other: ViewSpacing,
    edges: Edge.Set = .all
) -> ViewSpacing
```

## Parameters 

`other`  

Another spacing preferences instance to merge with this one.

`edges`  

The edges to merge. Edges that you donâ€™t specify are unchanged after the method completes.

## Return Value

A new view spacing preferences instance with the merged values.

## Discussion

This method behaves like formUnion(_:edges:), except that it creates a copy of the original spacing preferences instance before merging, leaving the original instance unmodified.
