# Focus

Identify and control which visible object responds to user interaction.

## Overview

Focus indicates which element in the display recieves the next input. Use view modifiers to indicate which views can receive focus, to detect which view has focus, and to programmatically control focus state.

For design guidance, see Focus and selection in the Human Interface Guidelines.

## Topics

### Essentials

Focus Cookbook: Supporting and enhancing focus-driven interactions in your SwiftUI app

Create custom focusable views with key-press handlers that accelerate keyboard input and support movement, and control focus programmatically.

### Indicating that a view can receive focus

func focusable(Bool) -> some View

Specifies if the view is focusable.

func focusable(Bool, interactions: FocusInteractions) -> some View

Specifies if the view is focusable, and if so, what focus-driven interactions it supports.

struct FocusInteractions

Values describe different focus interactions that a view can support.

### Managing focus state

func focused&lt;Value>(FocusState&lt;Value>.Binding, equals: Value) -> some View

Modifies this view by binding its focus state to the given state value.

func focused(FocusState&lt;Bool>.Binding) -> some View

Modifies this view by binding its focus state to the given Boolean state value.

var isFocused: Bool

Returns whether the nearest focusable ancestor has focus.

struct FocusState

A property wrapper type that can read and write a value that SwiftUI updates as the placement of focus within the scene changes.

struct FocusedValue

A property wrapper for observing values from the focused view or one of its ancestors.

macro Entry()

Creates an environment values, transaction, container values, or focused values entry.

protocol FocusedValueKey

A protocol for identifier types used when publishing and observing focused values.

struct FocusedBinding

A convenience property wrapper for observing and automatically unwrapping state bindings from the focused view or one of its ancestors.

func searchFocused(FocusState&lt;Bool>.Binding) -> some View

Modifies this view by binding the focus state of the search field associated with the nearest searchable modifier to the given Boolean value.

func searchFocused&lt;V>(FocusState&lt;V>.Binding, equals: V) -> some View

Modifies this view by binding the focus state of the search field associated with the nearest searchable modifier to the given value.

### Exposing value types to focused views

func focusedValue&lt;T>(T?) -> some View

Sets the focused value for the given object type.

func focusedValue(_:_:)

Modifies this view by injecting a value that you provide for use by other views whose state depends on the focused view hierarchy.

func focusedSceneValue&lt;T>(T?) -> some View

Sets the focused value for the given object type at a scene-wide scope.

func focusedSceneValue(_:_:)

Modifies this view by injecting a value that you provide for use by other views whose state depends on the focused scene.

struct FocusedValues

A collection of state exported by the focused view and its ancestors.

### Exposing reference types to focused views

func focusedObject(_:)

Creates a new view that exposes the provided object to other views whose whose state depends on the focused view hierarchy.

func focusedSceneObject(_:)

Creates a new view that exposes the provided object to other views whose whose state depends on the active scene.

struct FocusedObject

A property wrapper type for an observable object supplied by the focused view or one of its ancestors.

### Setting focus scope

func focusScope(Namespace.ID) -> some View

Creates a focus scope that SwiftUI uses to limit default focus preferences.

func focusSection() -> some View

Indicates that the viewâ€™s frame and cohort of focusable descendants should be used to guide focus movement.

### Controlling default focus

func prefersDefaultFocus(Bool, in: Namespace.ID) -> some View

Indicates that the view should receive focus by default for a given namespace.

func defaultFocus&lt;V>(FocusState&lt;V>.Binding, V, priority: DefaultFocusEvaluationPriority) -> some View

Defines a region of the window in which default focus is evaluated by assigning a value to a given focus state binding.

struct DefaultFocusEvaluationPriority

Prioritizations for default focus preferences when evaluating where to move focus in different circumstances.

### Resetting focus

var resetFocus: ResetFocusAction

An action that requests the focus system to reevaluate default focus.

struct ResetFocusAction

An environment value that provides the ability to reevaluate default focus.

### Configuring effects

func focusEffectDisabled(Bool) -> some View

Adds a condition that controls whether this view can display focus effects, such as a default focus ring or hover effect.

var isFocusEffectEnabled: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the view associated with this environment allows focus effects to be displayed.
