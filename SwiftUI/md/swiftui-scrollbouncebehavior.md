## Overview

Use the scrollBounceBehavior(_:axes:) view modifier to set a value of this type for a scrollable view, like a ScrollView or a List. The value configures the bounce behavior when people scroll to the end of the viewâ€™s content.

You can configure each scrollable axis to use a different bounce mode.
