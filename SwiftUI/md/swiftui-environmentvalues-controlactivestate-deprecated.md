Instance Property

# controlActiveState

The active appearance expected of controls in a window.

macOS 10.15â€“15.4Deprecated

``` source
var controlActiveState: ControlActiveState { get set }
```

Deprecated

Use \`EnvironmentValues.appearsActive\` instead.

## Discussion

`ControlActiveState` and `EnvironmentValues.controlActiveState` are deprecated, use `EnvironmentValues.appearsActive` instead.

Starting with macOS 15.0, the value of this environment property is strictly mapped to and from `EnvironmentValues.appearsActive` as follows:

- `appearsActive == true`, `controlActiveState` returns `.key`

- `appearsActive == false`, `controlActiveState` returns `.inactive`

- `controlActiveState` is set to `.key` or `.active`, `appearsActive` will be set to `true`.

- `controlActiveState` is set to `.inactive`, `appearsActive` will be set to `false`.
