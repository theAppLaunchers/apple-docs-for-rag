## Discussion

Use a DocumentGroup scene to tell SwiftUI what kinds of documents your app can open when you declare your app using the App protocol. You initialize a document group scene by passing in the document model and a view capable of displaying the documentâ€™s contents. The document types you supply to DocumentGroup must conform to FileDocument or ReferenceFileDocument. SwiftUI uses the model to add document support to your app. In macOS this includes document-based menu support including the ability to open multiple documents. On iOS this includes a document browser that can navigate to the documents stored on the file system and multiwindow support:

```
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        DocumentGroup(newDocument: TextFile()) { file in
            ContentView(document: file.$document)
        }
    }
}
```

The document types you supply to DocumentGroup must conform to FileDocument or ReferenceFileDocument. Your app can support multiple document types by adding additional DocumentGroup scenes.
