## Overview

When a view with a scroll transition modifier applied is approaching the visible region of the containing scroll view or other container, the effect will first be applied with the `topLeading` or `bottomTrailing` phase (depending on which edge the view is approaching), then will be moved to the `identity` phase as the view moves into the visible area. The timing and behavior that determines when a view is visible within the container is controlled by the configuration that is provided to the `scrollTransition` modifier.

In the `identity` phase, scroll transitions should generally not make any visual change to the view they are applied to, since the transitionâ€™s view modifications in the `identity` phase will be applied to the view as long as it is visible. In the `topLeading` and `bottomTrailing` phases, transitions should apply a change that will be animated to create the transition.

## Topics

### Getting the phase

case identity

The scroll transition is being applied to a view that is in the visible area.

case topLeading

The scroll transition is being applied to a view that is about to move into the visible area at the top edge of a vertical scroll view, or the leading edge of a horizont scroll view.

case bottomTrailing

The scroll transition is being applied to a view that is about to move into the visible area at the bottom edge of a vertical scroll view, or the trailing edge of a horizontal scroll view.

### Accessing the phase state

var isIdentity: Bool

var value: Double

A phase-derived value that can be used to scale or otherwise modify effects.

### Animating scroll transitions

func scrollTransition(ScrollTransitionConfiguration, axis: Axis?, transition: (EmptyVisualEffect, ScrollTransitionPhase) -> some VisualEffect) -> some View

Applies the given transition, animating between the phases of the transition as this view appears and disappears within the visible region of the containing scroll view, or other container specified using the `coordinateSpace` parameter.

func scrollTransition(topLeading: ScrollTransitionConfiguration, bottomTrailing: ScrollTransitionConfiguration, axis: Axis?, transition: (EmptyVisualEffect, ScrollTransitionPhase) -> some VisualEffect) -> some View

Applies the given transition, animating between the phases of the transition as this view appears and disappears within the visible region of the containing scroll view, or other container specified using the `coordinateSpace` parameter.

struct ScrollTransitionConfiguration

The configuration of a scroll transition that controls how a transition is applied as a view is scrolled through the visible region of a containing scroll view or other container.
