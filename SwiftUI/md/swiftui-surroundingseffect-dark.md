## Discussion

Use this value with the preferredSurroundingsEffect(_:) view modifier when you want to dim passthrough video while displaying a particular view. Doing so helps to draw attention to your appâ€™s content while still enabling people to remain aware of their surroundings. This value can be used in the shared space.
