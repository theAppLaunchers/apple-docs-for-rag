``` source
@MainActor @frozen @propertyWrapper @preconcurrency
struct FocusedObject where ObjectType : ObservableObject
```

## Overview

Focused objects invalidate the current view whenever the observable object changes. If multiple views publish a focused object using the same key, the wrapped property will reflect the object thatâ€™s closest to the focused view.

## Topics

### Creating the focused object

init()

### Getting the value

var projectedValue: FocusedObject&lt;ObjectType>.Wrapper?

A projection of the focused object that creates bindings to its properties using dynamic member lookup.

var wrappedValue: ObjectType?

The underlying value referenced by the focused object.

struct Wrapper

A wrapper around the underlying focused object that can create bindings to its properties using dynamic member lookup.
