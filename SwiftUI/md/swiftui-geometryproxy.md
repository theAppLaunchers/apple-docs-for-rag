func bounds(of: NamedCoordinateSpace) -> CGRect?

Returns the given coordinate space’s bounds rectangle, converted to the local coordinate space.

func frame(in:)

Returns the container view’s bounds rectangle, converted to a defined coordinate space.

var size: CGSize

The size of the container view.

var safeAreaInsets: EdgeInsets

The safe area inset of the container view.

subscript&lt;T>(Anchor&lt;T>) -> T

Resolves the value of an anchor to the container view.

func transform(in: some CoordinateSpaceProtocol) -> AffineTransform3D?
