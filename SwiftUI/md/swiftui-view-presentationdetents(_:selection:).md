``` source
nonisolated
func presentationDetents(
    _ detents: Set,
    selection: Binding
) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`detents`  

A set of supported detents for the sheet. If you provide more that one detent, people can drag the sheet to resize it.

`selection`  

A Binding to the currently selected detent. Ensure that the value matches one of the detents that you provide for the `detents` parameter.

## Discussion

By default, sheets support the large detent.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showSettings = false
    @State private var settingsDetent = PresentationDetent.medium

    var body: some View {
        Button("View Settings") {
            showSettings = true
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showSettings) {
            SettingsView()
                .presentationDetents(
                    [.medium, .large],
                    selection: $settingsDetent
                 )
        }
    }
}
```
