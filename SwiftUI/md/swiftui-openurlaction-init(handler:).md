Initializer

# init(handler:)

Creates an action that opens a URL.

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
init(handler: @escaping (URL) -> OpenURLAction.Result)
```

## Parameters 

`handler`  

The closure to run for the given URL. The closure takes a URL as input, and returns a OpenURLAction.Result that indicates the outcome of the action.

## Discussion

Use this initializer to create a custom action for opening URLs. Provide a handler that takes a URL and returns an OpenURLAction.Result. Place your handler in the environment using the environment(_:_:) view modifier:

```
Text("Visit [Example Company](https://www.example.com) for details.")
    .environment(\.openURL, OpenURLAction { url in
        handleURL(url) // Define this method to take appropriate action.
        return .handled
    })
```

Any views that read the action from the environment, including the built-in Link view and Text views with markdown links, or links in attributed strings, use your action.

SwiftUI translates the value that your custom actionâ€™s handler returns into an appropriate Boolean result for the action call. For example, a view that uses the action declared above receives `true` when calling the action, because the handler always returns handled.
