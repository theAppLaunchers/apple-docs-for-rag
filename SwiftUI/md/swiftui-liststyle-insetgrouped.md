``` source
static var insetGrouped: InsetGroupedListStyle { get }
```

Available when `Self` is `InsetGroupedListStyle`.

## Discussion

On iOS, the inset grouped list style displays a continuous background color that extends from the section header, around both sides of list items in the section, and down to the section footer. This visually groups the items to a greater degree than either the inset or grouped styles do.
