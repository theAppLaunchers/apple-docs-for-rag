# WatchKit integration

Add WatchKit views to your SwiftUI app, or use SwiftUI views in your WatchKit app.

## Overview

Integrate SwiftUI with your appâ€™s existing content using hosting controllers to add SwiftUI views into WatchKit interfaces. A hosting controller wraps a set of SwiftUI views in a form that you can then add to your storyboard-based app.

You can also add WatchKit views and view controllers to your SwiftUI interfaces. A representable object wraps the designated view or view controller, and facilitates communication between the wrapped object and your SwiftUI views.

For design guidance, see Designing for watchOS in the Human Interface Guidelines.
