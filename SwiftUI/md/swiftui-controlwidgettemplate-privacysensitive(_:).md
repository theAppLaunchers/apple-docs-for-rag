## Discussion

The system redacts controls marked with this modifier when those controls are displayed on the Lock Screen and the device is locked.

Controls also respect the privacySensitive(_:) modifier applied to the controlâ€™s label. That modifier only redacts the control content, however. To redact the content *and* the state of the control, apply this modifier to the control template:

```
struct GarageDoorOpener: ControlWidget {
    var body: some ControlWidgetConfiguration {
        StaticControlConfiguration(...) {
            ControlWidgetToggle(...) {
                Label(
                    $0 ? "Open" : "Closed",
                    systemImage: $0 ? "door.open" : "door.closed"
                )
            }
            .privacySensitive()
        }
    }
}
```
