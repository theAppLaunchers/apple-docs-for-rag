``` source
struct ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior
```

## Overview

You use this behavior when a scroll view should always align its scroll targets to a rectangle thatâ€™s aligned to the geometry of a view. In the following example, the scroll view always picks an item view to settle on.

```
ScrollView(.horizontal) {
    LazyHStack(spacing: 10.0) {
        ForEach(items) { item in
          ItemView(item)
        }
    }
    .scrollTargetLayout()
}
.scrollTargetBehavior(.viewAligned)
.padding(.horizontal, 20.0)
```

You configure which views should be used for settling using the scrollTargetLayout(isEnabled:) modifier. Apply this modifier to a layout container like LazyVStack or HStack and each individual view in that layout will be considered for alignment.

You can customize whether the view aligned behavior limits the number of views that can be scrolled at a time by using the ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior.LimitBehavior type. Provide a value of always to always have the behavior only allow a few views to be scrolled at a time.

By default, the view aligned behavior will limit the number of views it scrolls when in a compact horizontal size class when scrollable in the horizontal axis, when in a compact vertical size class when scrollable in the vertical axis, and otherwise does not impose any limit on the number of views that can be scrolled.
