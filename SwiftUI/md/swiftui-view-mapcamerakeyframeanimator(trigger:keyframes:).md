``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
func mapCameraKeyframeAnimator(
    trigger: some Equatable,
    @KeyframesBuilder keyframes: @escaping (MapCamera) -> some Keyframes
) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`trigger`  

A value to observe for changes.

`keyframes`  

A keyframes builder closure that is called when starting a new keyframe animation. The current map camera is provided as the only parameter.

## Discussion

When the trigger value changes, the map calls the `keyframes` closure to generate the keyframes that will animate the camera. The animation will continue for the duration of the keyframes that you specify.

If the user performs a gesture while the animation is in progress, the animation will be immediately removed, allowing the interaction to take control of the camera.
