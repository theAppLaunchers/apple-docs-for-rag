``` source
subscript(key: K.Type) -> K.Value where K : TransactionKey { get set }
```

## Overview

Create custom transaction values by defining a key that conforms to the TransactionKey protocol, and then using that key with the subscript operator of the Transaction structure to get and set a value for that key:

```
private struct MyTransactionKey: TransactionKey {
    static let defaultValue = false
}

extension Transaction {
    var myCustomValue: Bool {
        get { self[MyTransactionKey.self] }
        set { self[MyTransactionKey.self] = newValue }
    }
}
```
