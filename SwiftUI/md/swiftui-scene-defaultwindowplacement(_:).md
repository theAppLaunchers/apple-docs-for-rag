Instance Method

# defaultWindowPlacement(\_:)

Defines a function used for determining the default placement of windows.

macOS 15.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
nonisolated
func defaultWindowPlacement(_ makePlacement: @escaping (WindowLayoutRoot, WindowPlacementContext) -> WindowPlacement) -> some Scene
```

## Parameters 

`makePlacement`  

A closure to generate the default window placement.

## Discussion

Use this scene modifier to indicate a default initial size and position for a new window that the system creates from a Scene declaration.

On macOS, you can use the screen’s bounds to place the window. For example, you can specify that the window is always placed 140 points from the bottom of the screen:

```
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        ...

        Window("Status", id: "status") {
            StatusView()
        }
        .windowResizability(.contentSize)
        .defaultWindowPlacement { content, context in
            let displayBounds = context.defaultDisplay.visibleRect
            let size = content.sizeThatFits(.unspecified)
            let position = CGPoint(
                x: displayBounds.midX - (size.width / 2),
                y: displayBounds.maxY - size.height - 140)
            return WindowPlacement(position: position, size: size)
        }
    }
}
```

On visionOS, the system always places the first window relative to where the person is looking. The system ignores calls to `defaultWindowPlacement(_:)`.

You can place any subsequent windows relative to existing ones by returning one of the methods defined by WindowPlacement.Position with the existing window. For example, you can align the new window with the trailing edge of the `Content` window:

```
struct MyApp: App {
    @Environment(\.openWindow) private var openWindow

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup("Content", id: "content") {
            Button("Open status window") {
                openWindow(id: "status")
            }
        }

        WindowGroup("Status", id: "status") {
            StatusView()
        }
        .windowResizability(.contentSize)
        .defaultWindowPlacement { content, context in
            if let contentWindow = context.windows.first(
            where: { $0.id == "content" }) {
                WindowPlacement(.trailing(contentWindow))
            } else {
                WindowPlacement()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The placement that your function returns acts as a default for when the window first appears. People can later resize and move the window using interface controls that the system provides. Also, during state restoration, the system restores the window to it’s most recent size and position, rather than the default placement.

For more information on configuring how scenes behave with state restoration, see `Scene.stateRestoration(_:)`.
