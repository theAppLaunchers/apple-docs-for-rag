## Discussion

A stopwatch styled display that starts counting up from zero at the given `startDate`.

- startDate: The date at which the stopwatch starts counting.

- showsHours: If true, the stopwatch shows the hours as a separate element on the formatted string, once the duration is at least one hour. If false, the stopwatch displays minute values greather than sixty.

- maxFieldCount: The number of fields that can be shown at once. For example, 1 hour, 34 minutes is shown as `1:34:00` by default, but as `1:34` if the `maxFieldCount` is set to two. The style automatically excludes more significant fields if their value is zero and they are not necessary for the format pattern, making room for less significant fields.

- maxPrecision: The precision at which the input is formatted. E.g. by default, two fractional digits are shown, making the maximum precision ten milliseconds. Setting the maximum precision to `.seconds(60)` would only allow hours and minutes to be shown.
