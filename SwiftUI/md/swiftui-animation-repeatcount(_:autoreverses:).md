Instance Method

# repeatCount(\_:autoreverses:)

Repeats the animation for a specific number of times.

``` source
func repeatCount(
    _ repeatCount: Int,
    autoreverses: Bool = true
) -> Animation
```

## Parameters 

`repeatCount`  

The number of times that the animation repeats. Each repeated sequence starts at the beginning when `autoreverse` is `false`.

`autoreverses`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation sequence plays in reverse after playing forward. Autoreverse counts towards the `repeatCount`. For instance, a `repeatCount` of one plays the animation forward once, but it doesnâ€™t play in reverse even if `autoreverse` is `true`. When `autoreverse` is `true` and `repeatCount` is `2`, the animation moves forward, then reverses, then stops.

## Return Value

An animation that repeats for specific number of times.

## Discussion

Use this method to repeat the animation a specific number of times. For example, in the following code, the animation moves a truck from one edge of the view to the other edge. It repeats this animation three times.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var driveForward = true

    private var driveAnimation: Animation {
        .easeInOut
        .repeatCount(3, autoreverses: true)
        .speed(0.5)
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: driveForward ? .leading : .trailing, spacing: 40) {
            Image(systemName: "box.truck")
                .font(.system(size: 48))
                .animation(driveAnimation, value: driveForward)

            HStack {
                Spacer()
                Button("Animate") {
                    driveForward.toggle()
                }
                Spacer()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

 Video with custom controls. 

 Content description: A video that shows a box truck moving from the leading edge of a view to the trailing edge, and back again before looping in the opposite direction. 

Play 

The first time the animation runs, the truck moves from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the view. The second time the animation runs, the truck moves from the trailing edge to the leading edge because `autoreverse` is `true`. If `autoreverse` were `false`, the truck would jump back to leading edge before moving to the trailing edge. The third time the animation runs, the truck moves from the leading to the trailing edge of the view.
