## Parameters 

`supportedContentTypes`  

An array of UTI types that the dynamic view supports.

`action`  

A closure that SwiftUI invokes when elements are added to the view. The closure takes two arguments: The first argument is the offset relative to the dynamic viewâ€™s underlying collection of data. The second argument is an array of NSItemProvider items that represents the data that you want to insert.

## Return Value

A view that calls `action` when elements are inserted into the original view.
