## Discussion

The order that the widgets appear in this property determines the order they are shown to the user when adding a widget. The following example shows how to use a widget bundle builder to define a body showing a game status widget first and a character detail widget second:

```
@main
struct GameWidgets: WidgetBundle {
   var body: some Widget {
       GameStatusWidget()
       CharacterDetailWidget()
   }
}
```
