## Overview

Use an array of `GridItem` instances to configure the layout of items in a lazy grid. Each grid item in the array specifies layout properties like size and spacing for the rows of a LazyHGrid or the columns of a LazyVGrid. The following example defines four rows for a horizontal grid, each with different characteristics:

```
struct GridItemDemo: View {
    let rows = [
        GridItem(.fixed(30), spacing: 1),
        GridItem(.fixed(60), spacing: 10),
        GridItem(.fixed(90), spacing: 20),
        GridItem(.fixed(10), spacing: 50)
    ]

    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            LazyHGrid(rows: rows, spacing: 5) {
                ForEach(0...300, id: \.self) { _ in
                    Color.red.frame(width: 30)
                    Color.green.frame(width: 30)
                    Color.blue.frame(width: 30)
                    Color.yellow.frame(width: 30)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

A lazy horizontal grid sets the width of each column based on the widest cell in the column. It can do this because it has access to all of the views in a given column at once. In the example above, the Color views always have the same fixed width, resulting in a uniform column width across the whole grid.

However, a lazy horizontal grid doesnâ€™t generally have access to all the views in a row, because it generates new cells as people scroll through information in your app. Instead, it relies on a grid item for information about each row. The example above indicates a different fixed height for each row, and sets a different amount of spacing to appear after each row:

## Topics

### Creating a grid item

init(GridItem.Size, spacing: CGFloat?, alignment: Alignment?)

Creates a grid item with the specified size, spacing, and alignment.

### Inspecting grid item properties

var alignment: Alignment?

The alignment to use when placing each view.

var spacing: CGFloat?

The spacing to the next item.

var size: GridItem.Size

The size of the item, which is the width of a column item or the height of a row item.

enum Size

The size in the minor axis of one or more rows or columns in a grid layout.
