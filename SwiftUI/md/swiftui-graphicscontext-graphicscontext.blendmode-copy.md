``` source
static var copy: GraphicsContext.BlendMode { get }
```

## Discussion

Unlike the normal mode, the source image completely replaces the background, so that even transparent pixels in the source image replace opaque pixels in the background, rather than letting the background show through.

This mode implements the equation `R = S` where

- `R` is the composite image.

- `S` is the source image.
