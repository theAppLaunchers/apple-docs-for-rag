Type Property

# handGestureShortcut

A finger or wrist movement that the user can perform in order to scroll a view.

watchOS 11.0+

``` source
static let handGestureShortcut: ScrollInputKind
```

## Discussion

On watchOS, double-tapping the thumb and index finger together will scroll a view when no on-screen control has been designated the primary action for that hand gesture shortcut.
