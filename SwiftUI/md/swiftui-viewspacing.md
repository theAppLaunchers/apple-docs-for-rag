## Overview

This type represents how much space a view prefers to have between it and the next view in a layout. The type stores independent values for each of the top, bottom, leading, and trailing edges, and can also record different values for different kinds of adjacent views. For example, it might contain one value for the spacing to the next text view along the top and bottom edges, other values for the spacing to text views on other edges, and yet other values for other kinds of views. Spacing preferences can also vary by platform.

Your Layout type doesnâ€™t have to take preferred spacing into account, but if it does, you can use the spacing preferences of the subviews in your layout container to:

- Add space between subviews when you implement the placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:) method.

- Create a spacing preferences instance for the container view by implementing the spacing(subviews:cache:) method.

## Topics

### Creating spacing instances

init()

Initializes an instance with default spacing values.

static let zero: ViewSpacing

A view spacing instance that contains zero on all edges.

### Measuring spacing distance

func distance(to: ViewSpacing, along: Axis) -> CGFloat

Gets the preferred spacing distance along the specified axis to the view that returns a specified spacing preference.

### Merging spacing instances

func formUnion(ViewSpacing, edges: Edge.Set)

Merges the spacing preferences of another spacing instance with this instance for a specified set of edges.

func union(ViewSpacing, edges: Edge.Set) -> ViewSpacing

Gets a new value that merges the spacing preferences of another spacing instance with this instance for a specified set of edges.
