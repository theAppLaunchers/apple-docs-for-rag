Type Property

# selection

A style used to visually indicate selection following platform conventional colors and behaviors.

iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
static var selection: SelectionShapeStyle { get }
```

Available when `Self` is `SelectionShapeStyle`.

## Discussion

For example:

```
ForEach(items) {
   ItemView(value: item, isSelected: item.id == selectedID)
}

struct ItemView {
    var value: item
    var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        // construct the actual cell content
            .background(isSelected
                ? AnyShapeStyle(.selection)
                    : AnyShapeStyle(.fill.quaternary),
                in: .rect(cornerRadius: 6))
    }
}
```

On macOS and iPadOS this automatically reflects window key state and focus state, where the emphasized appearance will be used only when the window is key and the nearest focusable element is actually focused. On iPhone, this will always fill with the environmentâ€™s accent color.

When applied as a background of another view, it will automatically set the `EnvironmentValues.backgroundProminence` for the environment of that view to match the current prominence of the selection.
