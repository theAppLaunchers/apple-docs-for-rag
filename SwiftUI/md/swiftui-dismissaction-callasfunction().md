## Discussion

Donâ€™t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it for you when you call the DismissAction structure that you get from the Environment:

```
private struct SheetContents: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss

    var body: some View {
        Button("Done") {
            dismiss() // Implicitly calls dismiss.callAsFunction()
        }
    }
}
```
