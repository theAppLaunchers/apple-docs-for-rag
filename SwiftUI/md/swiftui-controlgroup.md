# ControlGroup

A container view that displays semantically-related controls in a visually-appropriate manner for the context

``` source
struct ControlGroup where Content : View
```

## Overview

You can provide an optional label to this view that describes its children. This view may be used in different ways depending on the surrounding context. For example, when you place the control group in a toolbar item, SwiftUI uses the label when the group is moved to the toolbarâ€™s overflow menu.

```
ContentView()
    .toolbar(id: "items") {
        ToolbarItem(id: "media") {
            ControlGroup {
                MediaButton()
                ChartButton()
                GraphButton()
            } label: {
                Label("Plus", systemImage: "plus")
            }
        }
    }
```
