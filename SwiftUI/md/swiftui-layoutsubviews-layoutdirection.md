## Discussion

SwiftUI supports both left-to-right and right-to-left directions. Read this property within a custom layout container to find out which environment the container is in.

In most cases, you donâ€™t need to take any action based on this value. SwiftUI horizontally flips the x position of each view within its parent when the mode switches, so layout calculations automatically produce the desired effect for both directions.
