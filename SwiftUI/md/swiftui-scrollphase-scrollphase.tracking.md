# ScrollPhase.tracking

The tracking phase where the scroll view is tracking a potential scroll by the user but the user hasnâ€™t started a scroll.

``` source
case tracking
```

## Discussion

For example, on iOS, the user may start touching content inside of the scroll view. Until the user moves their finger the scroll view would be tracking the the finger. Not all platforms or kinds of scroll may trigger this phase.
