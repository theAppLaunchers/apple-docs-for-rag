``` source
struct WindowManagerRole
```

## Overview

Use values of this type in conjunction with the windowManagerRole(_:) modifier to override the default system behavior.

For example, you can specify that a secondary `Window` scene should use the principal role for full screen and Stage Manager:

```
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        Window("Organizer", id: "organizer") {
            OrganizerView()
        }
        .windowManagerRole(.principal)
    }
}
```

## Topics

### Type Properties

static let associated: WindowManagerRole

The associated role. Windows derived from this scene can be shown alongside windows with a `.principal` role in either full screen or Stage Manager, but do not participate in those modes on their own.

static let automatic: WindowManagerRole

The automatic role. The type and configuration of the scene will be used to determine how its windows behave in full screen and Stage Manager.

static let principal: WindowManagerRole

The principal role. Windows derived from this scene will show in full screen, if enabled, or in Stage Manager.
