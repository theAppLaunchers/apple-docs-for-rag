## Parameters 

`label`  

Localized string used to show this Rotor entry to users.

`id`  

Used to find the UI element associated with this Rotor entry. This identifier should be used within a `scrollView`, either in a `ForEach` or using an `id` call.

`textRange`  

Optional range of text associated with this Rotor entry. This should be a range within text that is set as the either label or accessibility value of the associated element.

`prepare`  

Optional closure to run before a Rotor entry is navigated to, to prepare the UI as needed. This can be used to bring the UI element on-screen if it isnâ€™t already, and SwiftUI is not able to automatically scroll to it.
