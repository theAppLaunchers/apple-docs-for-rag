# DismissBehavior

Programmatic window dismissal behaviors.

iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOS 14.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
struct DismissBehavior
```

## Overview

Use values of this type to control window dismissal during the current transaction.

For example, to dismiss windows showing a modal presentation that would otherwise prohibit dismissal, use the destructive behavior:

```
struct DismissWindowButton: View {
    @Environment(\.dismissWindow) private var dismissWindow

    var body: some View {
        Button("Close Auxiliary Window") {
            withTransaction(\.dismissBehavior, .destructive) {
                dismissWindow(id: "auxiliary")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
