## Discussion

You can associate a UnitPoint to a ScrollView using the defaultScrollAnchor(_:) modifier. By default, the system uses this point for different kinds of behaviors including:

- Where the scroll view should initially be scrolled

- How the scroll view should handle content size or container size changes

- How the scroll view should align content smaller than its container size

You can further customize this behavior by assigning different unit points for these different cases.

For example, you can use the defaultScrollAnchor(_:) modifier to provide a value of bottom as the anchor for all cases and then opt out of certain cases by providing a different value for them.

```
@Binding var items: [Item]
@Binding var scrolledID: Item.ID?

ScrollView {
    LazyVStack {
        ForEach(items) { item in
            ItemView(item)
        }
    }
}
.defaultScrollAnchor(.bottom)
.defaultScrollAnchor(.topLeading, for: .alignment)
```
