iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.15+tvOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 6.0+

``` source
func repeatForever(autoreverses: Bool = true) -> Animation
```

## Parameters 

`autoreverses`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation sequence plays in reverse after playing forward.

## Return Value

An animation that continuously repeats.

## Discussion

Use this method to repeat the animation until the instance of the view no longer exists, or the viewâ€™s explicit or structural identity changes. For example, the following code continuously rotates a gear symbol for the lifespan of the view.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var rotationDegrees = 0.0

    private var animation: Animation {
        .linear
        .speed(0.1)
        .repeatForever(autoreverses: false)
    }

    var body: some View {
        Image(systemName: "gear")
            .font(.system(size: 86))
            .rotationEffect(.degrees(rotationDegrees))
            .onAppear {
                withAnimation(animation) {
                    rotationDegrees = 360.0
                }
            }
    }
}
```

 Video with custom controls.
