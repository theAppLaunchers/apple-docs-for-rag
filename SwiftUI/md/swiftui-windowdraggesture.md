# WindowDragGesture

A gesture that recognizes the motion of and handles dragging a window.

macOS 15.0+

``` source
struct WindowDragGesture
```

## Overview

To recognize a window drag gesture on a view, create and configure the gesture, and then add it to the view using the gesture(_:isEnabled:) modifier. Consider also letting the gesture handle events that activate the containing window so that dragging the containing window works even when itâ€™s inactive.

To add a window drag gesture to a Circle and change its color while a user performs the window drag gesture:

```
struct MyView: View {
    @GestureState var isDraggingWindow = false

    var dragWindow: some Gesture {
        WindowDragGesture()
            .updating($isDraggingWindow) { _, state, _ in
                state = true
            }
    }

    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(isDraggingWindow ? Color.green : .blue)
            .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
            .gesture(dragWindow)
            .allowsWindowActivationEvents()
    }
}
```
