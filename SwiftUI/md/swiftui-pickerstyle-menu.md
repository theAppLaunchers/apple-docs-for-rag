``` source
static var menu: MenuPickerStyle { get }
```

Available when `Self` is `MenuPickerStyle`.

## Discussion

Use this style when there are more than five options. Consider using inline when there are fewer than five options.

The button itself indicates the selected option. You can include additional controls in the set of options, such as a button to customize the list of options.

To apply this style to a picker, or to a view that contains pickers, use the pickerStyle(_:) modifier.
