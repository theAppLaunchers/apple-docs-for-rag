Replaces all commands defined by the modified scene with the commands from the builder.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
nonisolated
func commandsReplaced(@CommandsBuilder content: () -> Content) -> some Scene where Content : Commands
```

## Parameters 

`content`  

A `Commands` builder whose output will be used to replace the commands normally provided by the modified scene.

## Return Value

A scene that replaces any commands defined by its children with alternative content.

## Discussion

`WindowGroup`, `Window`, and other scene types all have an associated set of commands that they include by default. Apply this modifier to a scene to replace those commands with the output from the given builder.

For example, the following code adds a scene for showing the contents of the pasteboard in a dedicated window. We replace the sceneâ€™s default Window \> Clipboard menu command with a custom Edit \> Show Clipboard command that we place next to the other pasteboard commands.

```
@main
struct Example: App {
    @Environment(\.openWindow) var openWindow

    var body: some Scene {
        ...

        Window("Clipboard", id: "clipboard") {
            ClipboardContentView()
        }
        .commandsReplaced {
            CommandGroup(after: .pasteboard) {
                Section {
                    Button("Show Clipboard") {
                        openWindow(id: "clipboard")
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
