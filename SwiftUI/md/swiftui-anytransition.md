## Overview

## Topics

### Getting built-in transitions

static let identity: AnyTransition

A transition that returns the input view, unmodified, as the output view.

static func move(edge: Edge) -> AnyTransition

Returns a transition that moves the view away, towards the specified edge of the view.

static func offset(CGSize) -> AnyTransition

static func offset(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat) -> AnyTransition

static let opacity: AnyTransition

A transition from transparent to opaque on insertion, and from opaque to transparent on removal.

static func push(from: Edge) -> AnyTransition

Creates a transition that when added to a view will animate the viewâ€™s insertion by moving it in from the specified edge while fading it in, and animate its removal by moving it out towards the opposite edge and fading it out.

static var scale: AnyTransition

Returns a transition that scales the view.

static func scale(scale: CGFloat, anchor: UnitPoint) -> AnyTransition

Returns a transition that scales the view by the specified amount.

static var slide: AnyTransition

A transition that inserts by moving in from the leading edge, and removes by moving out towards the trailing edge.

### Combining and configuring transitions

func animation(Animation?) -> AnyTransition

Attaches an animation to this transition.

static func asymmetric(insertion: AnyTransition, removal: AnyTransition) -> AnyTransition

Provides a composite transition that uses a different transition for insertion versus removal.

func combined(with: AnyTransition) -> AnyTransition

Combines this transition with another, returning a new transition that is the result of both transitions being applied.

### Creating a custom transition

init&lt;T>(T)

Create an instance that type-erases `transition`.

static func modifier&lt;E>(active: E, identity: E) -> AnyTransition

Returns a transition defined between an active modifier and an identity modifier.

### Defining transitions

func transition(_:)

Associates a transition with the view.

protocol Transition

A description of view changes to apply when a view is added to and removed from the view hierarchy.

struct TransitionProperties

The properties a `Transition` can have.

enum TransitionPhase

An indication of which the current stage of a transition.

struct AsymmetricTransition

A composite `Transition` that uses a different transition for insertion versus removal.

func contentTransition(ContentTransition) -> some View

Modifies the view to use a given transition as its method of animating changes to the contents of its views.

var contentTransition: ContentTransition

The current method of animating the contents of views.

var contentTransitionAddsDrawingGroup: Bool

A Boolean value that controls whether views that render content transitions use GPU-accelerated rendering.

struct ContentTransition

A kind of transition that applies to the content within a single view, rather than to the insertion or removal of a view.

struct PlaceholderContentView

A placeholder used to construct an inline modifier, transition, or other helper type.

func navigationTransition(some NavigationTransition) -> some View

Sets the navigation transition style for this view.

protocol NavigationTransition

A type that defines the transition to use when navigating to a view.

func matchedTransitionSource(id: some Hashable, in: Namespace.ID) -> some View

Identifies this view as the source of a navigation transition, such as a zoom transition.

func matchedTransitionSource(id: some Hashable, in: Namespace.ID, configuration: (EmptyMatchedTransitionSourceConfiguration) -> some MatchedTransitionSourceConfiguration) -> some View

Identifies this view as the source of a navigation transition, such as a zoom transition.

protocol MatchedTransitionSourceConfiguration

A configuration that defines the appearance of a matched transition source.
