**Required** Default implementation provided.

## Discussion

Implement this method if changes to your view controller might affect other parts of your app. In your implementation, create a custom Swift instance that can communicate with other parts of your interface. For example, you might provide an instance that binds its variables to SwiftUI properties, causing the two to remain synchronized. If your view controller doesnâ€™t interact with other parts of your app, providing a coordinator is unnecessary.

SwiftUI calls this method before calling the makeUIViewController(context:) method. The system provides your coordinator either directly or as part of a context structure when calling the other methods of your representable instance.
