Instance Method

# windowIdealPlacement(\_:)

Provides a function which determines a placement to use when windows of a scene zoom.

macOS 15.0+

``` source
nonisolated
func windowIdealPlacement(_ makePlacement: @escaping (WindowLayoutRoot, WindowPlacementContext) -> WindowPlacement) -> some Scene
```

## Parameters 

`makePlacement`  

A closure which returns the ideal placement for a window derived from this scene.

## Discussion

The default behavior will size the window to its maximum size, or the bounds of the display, whichever is smaller. By overriding this behavior, you can provide a size that is appropriate for the contents of your window.

For example, you can provide a placement with a height equal to the display bounds, and a width based on your contentâ€™s ideal width:

```
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .windowIdealPlacement { content, context in
            let displayBounds = context.defaultDisplay.visibleRect
            let proposal = ProposedViewSize(
                width: nil, height: displayBounds.height)
            let contentSize = content.sizeThatFits(proposal)
            return .init(
                width: contentSize.width,
                height: contentSize.height)
        }
    }
}
```
