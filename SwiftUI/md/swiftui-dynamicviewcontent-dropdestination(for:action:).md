``` source
nonisolated
func dropDestination(
    for payloadType: T.Type = T.self,
    action: @escaping ([T], Int) -> Void
) -> some DynamicViewContent where T : Transferable
```

## Parameters 

`payloadType`  

Type of the models that are dropped.

`action`  

A closure that SwiftUI invokes when elements are added to the view. The closure takes two arguments: The first argument is the offset relative to the dynamic viewâ€™s underlying collection of data. The second argument is an array of `Transferable` items that represents the data that you want to insert.

## Return Value

A view that calls `action` when elements are inserted into the original view.

        ForEach(profiles) { profile in
            Text(profile.givenName)
