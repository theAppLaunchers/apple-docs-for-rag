Use this property to disable text selection of views that you donâ€™t want people to select and copy, even if contained within an overall context that allows text selection.

```
content // Content that might contain Text views.
   .textSelection(.disabled)
   .padding()
   .contentShape(Rectangle())
   .gesture(someGesture)
```
