iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+watchOS 9.0+

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
func widgetAccentable(_ accentable: Bool = true) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`accentable`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether to add the view and its subviews to the accented group.

## Discussion

When the system renders the widget using the `WidgetKit/WidgetRenderingMode/accented` mode, it divides the widget’s view hierarchy into two groups: the accented group and the default group. It then applies a different color to each group.

When applying the colors, the system treats the widget’s views as if they were template images. It ignores the view’s color — rendering the new colors based on the view’s alpha channel.

To control your view’s appearance, add the `widgetAccentable(_:)` modifier to part of your view’s hierarchy. If the `accentable` parameter is `true`, the system adds that view and all of its subviews to the accent group. It puts all other views in the default group.

```
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Text("MON")
            .font(.caption)
            .widgetAccentable()
        Text("6")
            .font(.title)
        }
    }
}
```

Important

After you call `widgetAccentable(true)` on a view moving it into the accented group, calling `widgetAccentable(false)` on its subviews doesn’t move the subviews back into the default group.
