``` source
struct RenameButton where Label : View
```

## Overview

A rename button receives its action from the environment. Use the renameAction(_:) modifier to set the action. The system disables the button if you donâ€™t define an action.

```
struct RowView: View {
    @State private var text = ""
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool

    var body: some View {
        TextField(text: $item.name) {
            Text("Prompt")
        }
        .focused($isFocused)
        .contextMenu {
            RenameButton()
            // ... your own custom actions
        }
        .renameAction { $isFocused = true }
}
```

When someone taps the rename button in the context menu, the rename action focuses the text field by setting the `isFocused` property to true.

You can use this button inside of a navigation title menu and the navigation title modifier automatically configures the environment with the appropriate rename action.

```
ContentView()
    .navigationTitle($contentTitle) {
        // ... your own custom actions
        RenameButton()
    }
```
