## Discussion

`NSHostingView` will populate certain aspects of its associated window, depending on which options are specified.

For example, a hosting view can manage its windowâ€™s toolbar by including the `.toolbars` option:

```
struct RootView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ContentView()
            .toolbar {
                MyToolbarContent()
            }
    }
}

let view = NSHostingView(rootView: RootView())
view.sceneBridgingOptions = [.toolbars]
```

When this hosting view is set as the `contentView` for a window, the default value for this property will be `.all`, which includes the options for `.toolbars` and `.title`. Otherwise, the default value is `[]`.
