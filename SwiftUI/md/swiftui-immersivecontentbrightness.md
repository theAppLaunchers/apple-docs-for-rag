visionOS 1.0+

``` source
struct ImmersiveContentBrightness
```

## Overview

Use a value of this type as an input to the immersiveContentBrightness(_:) scene modifier to indicate the ambient content brightness of an ImmersiveSpace.

When you do this to create an environment thatâ€™s suitable for video playback, use one of the standard brightness values like bright, dim, or dark to provide good results for most use cases. To optimize further, you can create a custom brightness using a normalized value that expresses the linear brightness ratio between a standard dynamic range white video frame and the background that surrounds the player window.
