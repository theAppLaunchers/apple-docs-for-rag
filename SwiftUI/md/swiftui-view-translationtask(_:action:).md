``` source
nonisolated
func translationTask(
    _ configuration: TranslationSession.Configuration?,
    action: @escaping (TranslationSession) async -> Void
) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`configuration`  

A configuration for a `TranslationSession`. When this configuration is non-nil and changes. the `action` runs providing an instance of `TranslationSession` to perform translations.

`action`  

A closure that runs when the`configuration` is non-nil and changes. This closure runs when the view appears if `configuration` is initially non-nil. It provides a `TranslationSession` instance to perform one or multiple translations.

## Discussion

This task provides an instance of `TranslationSession` to use in translations. Whenever `TranslationSession/Configuration` changes and isnâ€™t `nil`, the closure `action` runs, providing a `TranslationSession` instance to perform one or more translations.

For example, you can create a `TranslationSession/Configuration` in response to a button press to trigger translation:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var sourceText = "Hallo, Welt!"
    var sourceLanguage: Locale.Language?
    var targetLanguage: Locale.Language?

    @State private var targetText: String?
    @State private var configuration: TranslationSession.Configuration?

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(targetText ?? sourceText)
            Button("Translate") {
                guard configuration == nil else {
                    configuration?.invalidate()
                    return
                }

                 configuration = TranslationSession.Configuration(
                    source: sourceLanguage,
                    target: targetLanguage)
            }
            .translationTask(configuration) { session in
                Task { @MainActor in
                    do {
                        let response = try await session.translate(sourceText)
                        targetText = response.targetText
                    } catch {
                        // code to handle error
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The system throws a `fatalError` if you use a `TranslationSession` instance after the view it attaches to disappears, or if you use it after changing the `configuration`, causing the `action` closure to provide a new `TranslationSession` instance.
