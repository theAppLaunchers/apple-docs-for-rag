let label: ToggleStyleConfiguration.Label
```

## Discussion

Use this value in your implementation of the makeBody(configuration:) method when defining a custom ToggleStyle. Access it through the that methodâ€™s `configuration` parameter.

Because the label is a View, you can incorporate it into the view hierarchy that you return from your style definition. For example, you can combine the label with a circle image in an HStack:

```
HStack {
    Image(systemName: configuration.isOn
        ? "checkmark.circle.fill"
        : "circle")
    configuration.label
}
```
