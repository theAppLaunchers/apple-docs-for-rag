Instance Property

# stiffness

The spring stiffness coefficient.

var stiffness: Double { get }
```

## Discussion

Increasing the stiffness reduces the number of oscillations and will reduce the settling duration. Decreasing the stiffness increases the the number of oscillations and will increase the settling duration.

var bounce: Double

How bouncy the spring is.

var damping: Double

Defines how the springâ€™s motion should be damped due to the forces of friction.

var dampingRatio: Double

var duration: TimeInterval

The perceptual duration, which defines the pace of the spring.

var mass: Double

The mass of the object attached to the end of the spring.

var response: Double

The stiffness of the spring, defined as an approximate duration in seconds.

var settlingDuration: TimeInterval

The estimated duration required for the spring system to be considered at rest.
