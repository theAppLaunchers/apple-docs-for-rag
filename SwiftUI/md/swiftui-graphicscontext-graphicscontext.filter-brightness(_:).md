``` source
static func brightness(_ amount: Double) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
```

## Parameters 

`amount`  

An amount to add to the pixelâ€™s color components.

## Return Value

A filter that applies a brightness adjustment.

## Discussion

This filter is different than `brightness` filter primitive defined by the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) specification. You can obtain an effect like that filter using a grayscale(_:) color multiply. However, this filter does match the CIColorControls filterâ€™s brightness adjustment.
