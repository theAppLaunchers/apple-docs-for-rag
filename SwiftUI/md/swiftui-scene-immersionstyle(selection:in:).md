visionOS 1.0+

``` source
nonisolated
func immersionStyle(
    selection: Binding,
    in styles: any ImmersionStyle...
) -> some Scene
```

## Parameters 

`selection`  

A Binding to the style that the space uses. You can change this value to change the sceneâ€™s style even after you present the immersive space. Even though you provide a binding, the value changes only if you change it.

`styles`  

The list of styles that the `selection` input can have. Include any styles that you plan to use during the lifetime of the scene.

## Return Value

A scene that uses one of the specified `styles`.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to configure the appearance and behavior of an ImmersiveSpace. Specify a style that conforms to the ImmersionStyle protocol, like mixed or full. For example, the following app defines a solar system scene that uses full immersion:

```
@main
struct SolarSystemApp: App {
    @State private var style: ImmersionStyle = .full

    var body: some Scene {
        ImmersiveSpace {
            SolarSystem()
        }
        .immersionStyle(selection: $style, in: .full)
    }
}
```
