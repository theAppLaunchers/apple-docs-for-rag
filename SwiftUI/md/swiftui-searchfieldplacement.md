## Mentioned in 

Adding a search interface to your app

## Overview

You can give a preferred placement to any of the searchable modifiers, like searchable(text:placement:prompt:):

```
var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
        PrimaryView()
        SecondaryView()
        Text("Select a primary and secondary item")
    }
    .searchable(text: $text, placement: .sidebar)
}
```

Depending on the containing view hierachy, SwiftUI might not be able to fulfill your request.
