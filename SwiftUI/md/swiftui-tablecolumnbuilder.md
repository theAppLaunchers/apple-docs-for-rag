Structure

# TableColumnBuilder

A result builder that creates table column content from closures.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 12.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
@resultBuilder
struct TableColumnBuilder where RowValue : Identifiable, Sort : SortComparator
```

## Overview

The `buildBlock` methods in this type create TableColumnContent instances based on the number and types of sources provided as parameters.

Donâ€™t use this type directly; instead, SwiftUI annotates the `columns` parameter of the various Table initializers with the `@TableColumnBuilder` annotation, implicitly calling this builder for you.
