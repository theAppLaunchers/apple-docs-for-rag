## Discussion

Commands are realized in different ways on different platforms. On macOS, the main menu uses the available command menus and groups to organize its main menu items. Each menu is represented as a top-level menu bar menu, and each command group has a corresponding set of menu items in one of the top-level menus, delimited by separator menu items.

On iPadOS, commands with keyboard shortcuts are exposed in the shortcut discoverability HUD that users see when they hold down the Command (âŒ˜) key.

### Defining commands

func commandsRemoved() -> some Scene

Removes all commands defined by the modified scene.

func commandsReplaced&lt;Content>(content: () -> Content) -> some Scene

Replaces all commands defined by the modified scene with the commands from the builder.

protocol Commands

Conforming types represent a group of related commands that can be exposed to the user via the main menu on macOS and key commands on iOS.

struct CommandMenu

Command menus are stand-alone, top-level containers for controls that perform related, app-specific commands.

struct CommandGroup

Groups of controls that you can add to existing command menus.

struct CommandsBuilder

Constructs command sets from multi-expression closures. Like `ViewBuilder`, it supports up to ten expressions in the closure body.

struct CommandGroupPlacement

The standard locations that you can place new command groups relative to.
