## Discussion

This value changes as the userâ€™s chosen Dynamic Type size changes. The default value is device-dependent.

When limiting the Dynamic Type size, consider if adding a large content view with accessibilityShowsLargeContentViewer() would be appropriate.

On macOS, this value cannot be changed by users and does not affect the text size.
