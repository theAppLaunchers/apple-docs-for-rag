``` source
var supportsImagePlayground: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

The value of this property is `true` when the current device supports image generation. A device might not support this feature if the device or system doesnâ€™t meet the hardware requirements or the necessary environment (for example runs in a supported language) to generate the images.

Read this property from the environment to determine if your app can use the `imagePlaygroundSheet`.

```
struct ImageGenerationPresentingView: View {
    @Environment(\.supportsImagePlayground) private var supportsImagePlayground
    @State private var showsImagePlaygroundSheet = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Open Generation Sheet") {
            showsImagePlaygroundSheet = true
        }
        .disabled(!supportsImagePlayground)
    }
}
```
