Initializer

# init(timerInterval:countsDown:)

Creates a progress view for showing continuous progress as time passes.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 9.0+

``` source
nonisolated
init(
    timerInterval: ClosedRange,
    countsDown: Bool = true
)
```

Available when `Label` is `EmptyView` and `CurrentValueLabel` is `DefaultDateProgressLabel`.

## Parameters 

`timerInterval`  

The date range over which the view progresses.

`countsDown`  

If `true` (the default), the view empties as time passes.

## Discussion

Use this initializer to create a view that shows continuous progress within a date range. The following example initializes a progress view with a range of `start...end`, where `start` is 30 seconds in the past and `end` is 90 seconds in the future. As a result, the progress view begins at 25 percent complete.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    let start = Date().addingTimeInterval(-30)
    let end = Date().addingTimeInterval(90)

    var body: some View {
        ProgressView(interval: start...end
                     countsDown: false)
    }
}
```

By default, the progress view empties as time passes from the start of the date range to the end, but you can use the `countsDown` parameter to create a progress view that fills as time passes, as the above example demonstrates.

The progress view provided by this initializer omits a descriptive label and provides a text label that automatically updates to describe the current time remaining. To provide custom views for these labels, use init(value:total:label:currentValueLabel:) instead.

Note

Date-relative progress views, such as those created with this initializer, donâ€™t support custom styles.
