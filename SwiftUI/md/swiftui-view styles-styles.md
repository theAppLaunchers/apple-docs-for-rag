# View styles

Apply built-in and custom appearances and behaviors to different types of views.

## Overview

SwiftUI defines built-in styles for certain kinds of views and automatically selects the appropriate style for a particular presentation context. For example, a Label might appear as an icon, a string title, or both, depending on factors like the platform, whether the view appears in a toolbar, and so on.

You can override the automatic style by using one of the style view modifiers. These modifiers typically propagate throughout a container view, so that you can wrap a view hierarchy in a style modifier to affect all the views of the given type within the hierarchy.

Any of the style protocols that define a `makeBody(configuration:)` method, like ToggleStyle, also enable you to define custom styles. Create a type that conforms to the corresponding style protocol and implement its `makeBody(configuration:)` method. Then apply the new style using a style view modifier exactly like a built-in style.
