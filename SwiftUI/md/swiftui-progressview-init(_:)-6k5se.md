# init(\_:)

Show all declarations

## Parameters 

`titleKey`  

The key for the progress viewâ€™s localized title that describes the task in progress.

## Discussion

This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings. To initialize a indeterminate progress view with a string variable, use the corresponding initializer that takes a `StringProtocol` instance.
