static func buildOptional(_ widget: (any Widget & _LimitedAvailabilityWidgetMarker)?) -> some Widget
```

## Discussion

Conditional statements in a WidgetBundleBuilder can contain an `if` statement but not an `else` statement, and the condition can only perform a compiler check for availability, like in the following code:

```
var body: some Widget {
    if #available(iOS 16, *) {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```
