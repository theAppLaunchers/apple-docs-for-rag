## Discussion

For example, this is how a zoom action is used to transform the scale of a shape which has a `MagnificationGesture`.

```
var body: some View {
    Circle()
        .scaleEffect(magnifyBy)
        .gesture(magnification)
        .accessibilityLabel("Circle Magnifier")
        .accessibilityZoomAction { action in
            switch action.direction {
            case .zoomIn:
                magnifyBy += 0.5
            case .zoomOut:
                 magnifyBy -= 0.5
            }
        }
}
```

func accessibilityDirectTouch(Bool, options: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions) -> ModifiedContent&lt;Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>

The modifier accepts an optional `AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions` option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.

struct AccessibilityZoomGestureAction
