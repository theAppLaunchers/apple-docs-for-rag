``` source
enum Cadence
```

## Overview

Use the cadence presented to content in a TimelineView to hide information that updates faster than the viewâ€™s current update rate. For example, you could hide the millisecond component of a digital timer when the cadence is TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds or TimelineView.Context.Cadence.minutes.

Because this enumeration conforms to the Comparable protocol, you can compare cadences with relational operators. Slower cadences have higher values, so you could perform the check described above with the following comparison:

```
let hideMilliseconds = cadence > .live
```

## Topics
