## Discussion

Identifiers can be associated with a `Tab` or `TabSection` using the `customizationID(_:)` modifier.

```
TabSection("Categories") {
    Tab("Climate", systemImage: "fan") {
        ClimateView()
    }
    .customizationID("com.myApp.climate")

    Tab("Lights", systemImage: "lightbulb") {
        LightsView()
    }
    .customizationID("com.myApp.lights")
}
.customizationID("com.myApp.categories")
```

Section tab order can be read by subscripting the customization with the tab sectionâ€™s id:

```
let order = customization[section: "com.myApp.categories"].tabOrder
```

If the section has been customized, this returns the current order for all the tabs in the section, including tabs that have not been customized. If the section has not been customized or the identifier does not correspond to a section, the order will be nil to indicate the tab order matches that of the builder.
