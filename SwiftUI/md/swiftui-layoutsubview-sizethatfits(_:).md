func sizeThatFits(_ proposal: ProposedViewSize) -> CGSize

## Parameters 

`proposal`  

A proposed size for the subview. In SwiftUI, views choose their own size, but can take a size proposal from their parent view into account when doing so.

## Return Value

The size that the subview chooses for itself, given the proposal from its container view.

## Discussion

Use this method as a convenience to get the width and height properties of the ViewDimensions instance returned by the dimensions(in:) method, reported as a CGSize instance.
