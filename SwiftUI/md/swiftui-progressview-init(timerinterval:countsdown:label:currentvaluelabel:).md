Initializer

# init(timerInterval:countsDown:label:currentValueLabel:)

Creates a progress view for showing continuous progress as time passes, with descriptive and current progress labels.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 9.0+

``` source
nonisolated
init(
    timerInterval: ClosedRange,
    countsDown: Bool = true,
    @ViewBuilder label: () -> Label,
    @ViewBuilder currentValueLabel: () -> CurrentValueLabel
)
```

Available when `Label` conforms to `View` and `CurrentValueLabel` conforms to `View`.

## Parameters 

`timerInterval`  

The date range over which the view should progress.

`countsDown`  

A Boolean value that determines whether the view empties or fills as time passes. If `true` (the default), the view empties.

`label`  

An optional view that describes the purpose of the progress view.

`currentValueLabel`  

A view that displays the current value of the timer.

## Discussion

Use this initializer to create a view that shows continuous progress within a date range. The following example initializes a progress view with a range of `start...end`, where `start` is 30 seconds in the past and `end` is 90 seconds in the future. As a result, the progress view begins at 25 percent complete. This example also provides custom views for a descriptive label (Progress) and a current value label that shows the date range.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    let start = Date().addingTimeInterval(-30)
    let end = Date().addingTimeInterval(90)

    var body: some View {
        ProgressView(interval: start...end,
                     countsDown: false) {
            Text("Progress")
        } currentValueLabel: {
            Text(start...end)
         }
     }
}
```

By default, the progress view empties as time passes from the start of the date range to the end, but you can use the `countsDown` parameter to create a progress view that fills as time passes, as the above example demonstrates.

Note

Date-relative progress views, such as those created with this initializer, donâ€™t support custom styles.
