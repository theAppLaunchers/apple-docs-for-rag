## Discussion

You can read this value by creating a property with the Environment property wrapper and using it inside the action closure of the onPencilDoubleTap(perform:) view modifier as an indication of what to do after the user double-taps their Apple Pencil:

```
@Environment(\.preferredPencilDoubleTapAction) private var preferredAction

var body: some View {
    MyDrawingCanvas()
        .onPencilDoubleTap { value in
            switch preferredAction {
                ...
            }
        }
}
```

In macOS, this value cannot be changed by users and is always set to switchEraser.
