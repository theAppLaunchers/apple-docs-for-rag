Instance Method

# hoverEffectGroup(id:in:behavior:)

Activates this effect as part of an effect group.

visionOS 2.0+

``` source
func hoverEffectGroup(
    id: String? = nil,
    in namespace: Namespace.ID,
    behavior: HoverEffectGroup.Behavior = .activatesGroup
) -> some CustomHoverEffect
```

## Parameters 

`id`  

An optional id to give the group. If provided, the group will be uniquely identified by combining the id and the namespace.

`namespace`  

The namespace that identifies the group. If `nil`, this modifier has no effect.

`behavior`  

How the effect will behave relative to other effects in the group.

## Return Value

A new effect that activates with other effects in the same group.

## Discussion

You use this method to compose effects that change multiple views in concert. In the following example, both viewsâ€™ effects are in the same group. As a result, hovering over either view will activate all effects in the group, causing both views to become fully opaque:

```
struct EffectView: View {
    @Namespace var namespace

    var body: some View {
        Color.red
            .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
            .hoverEffect(
                FadeEffect().hoverEffectGroup(in: namespace)
            )
        Color.blue
            .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
            .hoverEffect(
                FadeEffect().hoverEffectGroup(in: namespace)
            )
    }
}

struct FadeEffect: CustomHoverEffect {
    func body(content: Content) -> some CustomHoverEffect {
        content.hoverEffect { effect, isActive, _ in
            effect.opacity(isActive ? 1 : 0.5)
        }
    }
}
```

The effect group is uniquely identified by combining the `id` and `namespace` parameters. If an `id` is not provided, the effect will be identified by the `namespace` alone. Providing an `id` is useful when creating effects that use multiple, closely-related groups.

The default behavior of an effect is to activate the effect group when hovered. The `behavior` parameter can be used to choose alternative behaviors. See HoverEffectGroup.Behavior for all possible behaviors.
