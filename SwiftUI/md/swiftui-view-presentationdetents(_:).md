`detents`  

A set of supported detents for the sheet. If you provide more that one detent, people can drag the sheet to resize it.

By default, sheets support the large detent.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showSettings = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("View Settings") {
            showSettings = true
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showSettings) {
            SettingsView()
                .presentationDetents([.medium, .large])
        }
    }
}
