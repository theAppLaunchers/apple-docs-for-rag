``` source
static let automatic: MenuOrder
```

## Discussion

On iOS, this order resolves to fixed for menus presented within scrollable content. Pickers that use the menu style also default to fixed order. In all other cases, menus default to priority order.

On macOS, tvOS and watchOS, the `automatic` order always resolves to fixed order.
