``` source

var layoutDirectionBehavior: LayoutDirectionBehavior { get }
```

**Required** Default implementation provided.

## Discussion

If the layoutDirectionBehavior for a Shape is one that mirrors, the shapeâ€™s path will be mirrored horizontally when in the specified layout direction. When mirrored, the individual points of the path will be transformed.

Defaults to `.mirrors` when deploying on iOS 17.0, macOS 14.0, tvOS 17.0, watchOS 10.0 and later, and to `.fixed` if not. To mirror a path when deploying to earlier releases, either use `View.flipsForRightToLeftLayoutDirection` for a filled or stroked shape or conditionally mirror the points in the path of the shape.
