``` source
var body: _ShapeView { get }
```

Available when `Self` conforms to `View` and `Body` is `_ShapeView`.

## Discussion

For a ShapeStyle that also conforms to the View protocol, like Color or LinearGradient, this default implementation of the body property provides a visual representation for the shape style. As a result, you can use the shape style in a view hierarchy like any other view:

```
ZStack {
    Color.cyan
    Text("Hello!")
}
.frame(width: 200, height: 50)
```
