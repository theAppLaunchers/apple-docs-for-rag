Instance Method

# gesture(\_:name:isEnabled:)

Attaches a gesture to the view with a lower precedence than gestures defined by the view.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+tvOS 18.0+visionOS 2.0+watchOS 11.0+

``` source
nonisolated
func gesture(
    _ gesture: T,
    name: String,
    isEnabled: Bool = true
) -> some View where T : Gesture
```

## Parameters 

`gesture`  

A gesture to attach to the view.

`name`  

A string that identifies the gesture. In iOS, the name can be used to set up failure relationships between UIKit gesture recognizers and this gesture.

`isEnabled`  

Whether the added gesture is enabled. The default value is `true`.

## Discussion

Use this method when you need to attach a gesture to a view. The example below defines a custom gesture that prints a message to the console and attaches it to the viewâ€™s VStack. Inside the VStack a red heart Image defines its own TapGesture handler that also prints a message to the console, and blue rectangle with no custom gesture handlers. Tapping or clicking the image prints a message to the console from the tap gesture handler on the image, while tapping or clicking the rectangle inside the VStack prints a message in the console from the enclosing vertical stack gesture handler.

You can also use the `isEnabled` parameter to conditionally disable the gesture.

```
struct GestureExample: View {
    @State private var message = "Message"
    var isGestureEnabled: Bool
    let newGesture = TapGesture().onEnded {
        print("Tap on VStack.")
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing:25) {
            Image(systemName: "heart.fill")
                .resizable()
                .frame(width: 75, height: 75)
                .padding()
                .foregroundColor(.red)
                .onTapGesture {
                    print("Tap on image.")
                }
            Rectangle()
                .fill(Color.blue)
        }
        .gesture(newGesture, isEnabled: isGestureEnabled)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
        .border(Color.purple)
    }
}
```
