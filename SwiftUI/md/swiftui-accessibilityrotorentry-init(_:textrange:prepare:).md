## Parameters 

`label`  

Optional localized string used to show this Rotor entry to users. If no label is specified, the Rotor entry will be labeled based on the text at that range.

`prepare`  

Optional closure to run before a Rotor entry is navigated to, to prepare the UI as needed. This can be used to bring the UI element or text on-screen if it isnâ€™t already, and SwiftUI not able to automatically scroll to it.
