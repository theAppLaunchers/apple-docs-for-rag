``` source
static func buildOptional(_ scene: (any Scene & _LimitedAvailabilitySceneMarker)?) -> some Scene
```

## Discussion

Conditional statements in a SceneBuilder can contain an `if` statement but not an `else` statement, and the condition can only perform a compiler check for availability, like in the following code:

```
var body: some Scene {
    if #available(iOS 16, *) {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```
