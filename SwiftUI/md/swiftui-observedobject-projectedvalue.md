Instance Property

# projectedValue

A projection of the observed object that creates bindings to its properties.

iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.15+tvOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 6.0+

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
var projectedValue: ObservedObject.Wrapper { get }
```

## Discussion

Use the projected value to get a Binding to a property of an observed object. To access the projected value, prefix the property variable with a dollar sign (`$`). For example, you can get a binding to a modelâ€™s `isEnabled` Boolean so that a Toggle can control its value:

```
struct MySubView: View {
    @ObservedObject var model: DataModel

    var body: some View {
        Toggle("Enabled", isOn: $model.isEnabled)
    }
}
```

Important

A `Binding` created by the projected value must only be read from, or written to by the main actor. Failing to do so may result in undefined behavior, or data loss. When this occurs, SwiftUI will issue a runtime warning. In a future release, a crash will occur instead.
