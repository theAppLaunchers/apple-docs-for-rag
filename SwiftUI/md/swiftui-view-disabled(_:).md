``` source
nonisolated
func disabled(_ disabled: Bool) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`disabled`  

A Boolean value that determines whether users can interact with this view.

## Return Value

A view that controls whether users can interact with this view.

## Discussion

The higher views in a view hierarchy can override the value you set on this view. In the following example, the button isnâ€™t interactive because the outer `disabled(_:)` modifier overrides the inner one:

```
HStack {
    Button(Text("Press")) {}
    .disabled(false)
}
.disabled(true)
```
