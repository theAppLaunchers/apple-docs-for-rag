Instance Property

A value that represents the barrel roll angle of the hovering Apple Pencil.

``` source
let roll: Angle
```

## Discussion

This value is `.zero` when the user starts using their Apple Pencil, and changes relative to that initial angle as the user rolls the Apple Pencil alongside its barrel. If the Apple Pencil doesnâ€™t support detecting its barrel roll angle, this property is always `.zero`.
