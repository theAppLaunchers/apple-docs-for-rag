## Overview

Assistive technologies can use this to improve a users navigation through multiple headings. When users navigate through top level headings they expect the content for each heading to be unrelated.

For example, you can categorize a list of available products into sections, like Fruits and Vegetables. With only top level headings, this list requires no heading hierarchy, and you use the AccessibilityHeadingLevel.unspecified heading level. On the other hand, if sections contain subsections, like if the Fruits section has subsections for varieties of Apples, Pears, and so on, you apply the AccessibilityHeadingLevel.h1 level to Fruits and Vegetables, and the AccessibilityHeadingLevel.h2 level to Apples and Pears.

Except for AccessibilityHeadingLevel.h1, be sure to precede all leveled headings by another heading with a level thatâ€™s one less.
