``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
override dynamic func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool)
```

## Parameters 

`animated`  

If `true`, the view is being added using an animation.

## Discussion

SwiftUI calls this method before adding the hosting controllerâ€™s root view to the view hierarchy. You can override this method to perform custom tasks associated with the appearance of the view. If you override this method, you must call `super` at some point in your implementation.
