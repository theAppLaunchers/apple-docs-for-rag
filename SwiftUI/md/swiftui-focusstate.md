# FocusState

A property wrapper type that can read and write a value that SwiftUI updates as the placement of focus within the scene changes.

``` source
@frozen @propertyWrapper
struct FocusState where Value : Hashable
```

## Overview

Use this property wrapper in conjunction with focused(_:equals:) and focused(_:) to describe views whose appearance and contents relate to the location of focus in the scene. When focus enters the modified view, the wrapped value of this property updates to match a given prototype value. Similarly, when focus leaves, the wrapped value of this property resets to `nil` or `false`. Setting the property’s value programmatically has the reverse effect, causing focus to move to the view associated with the updated value.

In the following example of a simple login screen, when the user presses the Sign In button and one of the fields is still empty, focus moves to that field. Otherwise, the sign-in process proceeds.

```
struct LoginForm {
    enum Field: Hashable {
        case username
        case password
    }

    @State private var username = ""
    @State private var password = ""
    @FocusState private var focusedField: Field?

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("Username", text: $username)
                .focused($focusedField, equals: .username)

            SecureField("Password", text: $password)
                .focused($focusedField, equals: .password)

            Button("Sign In") {
                if username.isEmpty {
                    focusedField = .username
                } else if password.isEmpty {
                    focusedField = .password
                } else {
                    handleLogin(username, password)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To allow for cases where focus is completely absent from a view tree, the wrapped value must be either an optional or a Boolean. Set the focus binding to `false` or `nil` as appropriate to remove focus from all bound fields. You can also use this to remove focus from a TextField and thereby dismiss the keyboard.

### Avoid ambiguous focus bindings

The same view can have multiple focus bindings. In the following example, setting `focusedField` to either `name` or `fullName` causes the field to receive focus:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    enum Field: Hashable {
        case name
        case fullName
    }
    @FocusState private var focusedField: Field?

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Full Name", ...)
            .focused($focusedField, equals: .name)
            .focused($focusedField, equals: .fullName)
    }
}
```

On the other hand, binding the same value to two views is ambiguous. In the following example, two separate fields bind focus to the `name` value:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    enum Field: Hashable {
        case name
        case fullName
    }
    @FocusState private var focusedField: Field?

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Name", ...)
            .focused($focusedField, equals: .name)
        TextField("Full Name", ...)
            .focused($focusedField, equals: .name) // incorrect re-use of .name
    }
}
```

If the user moves focus to either field, the `focusedField` binding updates to `name`. However, if the app programmatically sets the value to `name`, SwiftUI chooses the first candidate, which in this case is the “Name” field. SwiftUI also emits a runtime warning in this case, since the repeated binding is likely a programmer error.

## Topics

### Creating a focus state

init()

Creates a focus state that binds to a Boolean.

### Inspecting the focus state

var projectedValue: FocusState&lt;Value>.Binding

A projection of the focus state value that returns a binding.

struct Binding

A property wrapper type that can read and write a value that indicates the current focus location.

var wrappedValue: Value

The current state value, taking into account whatever bindings might be in effect due to the current location of focus.
