func textInputSuggestions(

) -> some View where Data : RandomAccessCollection, ID : Hashable, Content : View
```

`id`

`content`

## Discussion

You can suggest text completions during a text input operation by providing data to this modifier. The interface presents the suggestion views as a list of choices when someone activates the text editing interface.

Associate a string with each suggestion view by adding the textInputCompletion(_:) modifier to the view.

Use `Label` to get platform-standard visual representations of suggestion text accompanied with images, and `Section` for labelled sections of results.
