# conicGradient(\_:center:angle:)

A conic gradient that completes a full turn, optionally starting from a given angle and anchored to a relative center point within the filled shape.

    center: UnitPoint = .center,
    angle: Angle = .zero
) -> some ShapeStyle
```

Available when `Self` is `AngularGradient`.

## Parameters 

`gradient`  

The gradient to use for filling the shape, providing the colors and their relative stop locations.

`center`  

The relative center of the gradient, mapped from the unit space into the bounding rectangle of the filled shape.

`angle`  

The angle to offset the beginning of the gradientâ€™s full turn.

## Discussion

For example, a conic gradient used as a background:

```
let gradient = Gradient(colors: [.red, .yellow])

ContentView()
    .background(.conicGradient(gradient))
```
