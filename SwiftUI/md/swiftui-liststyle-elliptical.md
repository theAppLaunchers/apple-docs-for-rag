Type Property

# elliptical

The list style that describes the behavior and appearance of an elliptical list.

watchOS 7.0+

``` source
static var elliptical: EllipticalListStyle { get }
```

Available when `Self` is `EllipticalListStyle`.

## Discussion

On watchOS, the elliptical list style uses a transform for items rolling off the top or bottom of the list, as if on a rounded surface that faces the user.

Apple Watch Series 3 does not support this style and will instead fall back to using the plain style.
