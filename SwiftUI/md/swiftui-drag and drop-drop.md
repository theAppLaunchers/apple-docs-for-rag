# Drag and drop

Enable people to move or duplicate items by dragging them from one location to another.

## Overview

Drag and drop offers people a convenient way to move content from one part of your app to another, or from one app to another, using an intuitive dragging gesture. Support this feature in your app by adding view modifiers to potential source and destination views within your appâ€™s interface.

In your modifiers, provide or accept types that conform to the Transferable protocol, or that inherit from the NSItemProvider class. When possible, prefer using transferable items.

For design guidance, see Drag and drop in the Human Interface Guidelines.

## Topics

### Essentials

Adopting drag and drop using SwiftUI

Enable drag-and-drop interactions in lists, tables and custom views.

Making a view into a drag source

Adopt draggable API to provide items for drag-and-drop operations.

### Moving transferable items

func draggable&lt;T>(@autoclosure () -> T) -> some View

Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.

func draggable&lt;V, T>(@autoclosure () -> T, preview: () -> V) -> some View

Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.

func dropDestination&lt;T>(for: T.Type, action: ([T], CGPoint) -> Bool, isTargeted: (Bool) -> Void) -> some View

Defines the destination of a drag and drop operation that handles the dropped content with a closure that you specify.

### Moving items using item providers

func itemProvider(Optional&lt;() -> NSItemProvider?>) -> some View

Provides a closure that vends the drag representation to be used for a particular data element.

func onDrag&lt;V>(() -> NSItemProvider, preview: () -> V) -> some View

Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.

func onDrag(() -> NSItemProvider) -> some View

Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.

func onDrop(of:isTargeted:perform:)

Defines the destination of a drag-and-drop operation that handles the dropped content with a closure that you specify.

func onDrop(of:delegate:)

Defines the destination of a drag and drop operation using behavior controlled by the delegate that you provide.

protocol DropDelegate

An interface that you implement to interact with a drop operation in a view modified to accept drops.

struct DropProposal

The behavior of a drop.

enum DropOperation

Operation types that determine how a drag and drop session resolves when the user drops a drag item.

struct DropInfo

The current state of a drop.

### Configuring spring loading

func springLoadingBehavior(SpringLoadingBehavior) -> some View

Sets the spring loading behavior this view.

var springLoadingBehavior: SpringLoadingBehavior

The behavior of spring loaded interactions for the views associated with this environment.

struct SpringLoadingBehavior

The options for controlling the spring loading behavior of views.

### Event handling

Gestures

Define interactions from taps, clicks, and swipes to fine-grained gestures.

Input events

Respond to input from a hardware device, like a keyboard or a Touch Bar.

Clipboard

Enable people to move or duplicate items by issuing Copy and Paste commands.

Focus

Identify and control which visible object responds to user interaction.

System events

React to system events, like opening a URL.
