var header: SubviewsCollection { get }
```

## Discussion

Notably, the sectionâ€™s header is a `SubviewsCollection`, not a `Subview`, as it can be made up of multiple subviews. That means in most cases, the subviews collection should be treated as a collection (either indexed into, or used with a `ForEach`), or the subviews collection should be wrapped in a container view, like a layout, or other custom container:

```
ForEach(sections: content) {
    VStack {
        HStack { section.header }
        HStack { section.footer }
    }
}
```

Here, we surround the header and footer in an `HStack` layout to avoid vertically stacking the subviews of the header and footer which we want visually grouped together. Additionally, we surround the `ForEach` body in a VStack, so it is treated as a single view by containers it gets passed to.
