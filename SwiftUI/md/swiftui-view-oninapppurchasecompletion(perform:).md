``` source
nonisolated
func onInAppPurchaseCompletion(perform action: ((Product, Result) async -> ())?) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`action`  

The action to perform, with the product value and the purchase result provided as parameters.

## Discussion

By default, transactions from successful in-app store view purchases will be emitted from `Transaction.updates`. If the purchase fails with an error, an alert will be displayed. You can revert a view back to this behavior by providing `nil` for action.

Only one action will be performed for each purchase. Descendant views can override the action by using another onInAppPurchaseCompletion(perform:) modifier.
