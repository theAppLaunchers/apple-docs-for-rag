iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
nonisolated
func commandsRemoved() -> some Scene
```

## Return Value

A scene that excludes any commands defined by its children.

## Discussion

`WindowGroup`, `Window`, and other scene types all have an associated set of commands that they include by default. Apply this modifier to a scene to exclude those commands.

For example, the following code adds a scene for presenting the details of an individual data model in a separate window. To ensure that the window can only appear programmatically, we remove the sceneâ€™s commands, including File \> New Note Window.

```
@main
struct Example: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        ...

        WindowGroup("Note", id: "note", for: Note.ID.self) {
            NoteDetailView(id: $0)
        }
        .commandsRemoved()
    }
}
```
