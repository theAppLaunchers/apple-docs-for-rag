Instance Method

# translationPresentation(isPresented:text:attachmentAnchor:arrowEdge:replacementAction:)

Presents a translation popover when a given condition is true.

TranslationSwiftUIiOS 17.4+iPadOS 17.4+macOS 14.4+

``` source
nonisolated
func translationPresentation(
    isPresented: Binding,
    text: String,
    attachmentAnchor: PopoverAttachmentAnchor = .rect(.bounds),
    arrowEdge: Edge = .top,
    replacementAction: ((String) -> Void)? = nil
) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`isPresented`  

A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the popover.

`text`  

The text to be translated. Changing this after the popover presents has no effect.

`attachmentAnchor`  

The positioning anchor that defines the attachment point of the popover. The default is bounds.

`arrowEdge`  

The edge of the `attachmentAnchor` that defines the location of the popover’s arrow in macOS. The default is Edge.top. iOS ignores this parameter.

`replacementAction`  

An optional action to perform when someone interacts with the “Replace with Translation” button. The “Replace with Translation” button appears when you provide this action.

## Discussion

Use this method to show a system UI translation popover when the `translationVisible` Boolean variable is `true`. Attach this view modifier to the containing view holding the text to translate. Then set the `isPresented` Boolean binding to `true` when you want the popover to display. When you do, a system UI translation popover appears offering a translation.

In the example below, the popover appears when the user toggles the `translationVisible` state variable by pressing the Translate button.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var translationVisible = false
    private var originalText = "Hallo, Welt!"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(verbatim: originalText)
                .translationPresentation(isPresented: $translationVisible, text: originalText)
            Button("Translate") {
                translationVisible.toggle()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To replace the original text with the translation, pass in a trailing closure to the `replacementAction` parameter. When you do, a Replace with Translation button appears in the system UI. When the user taps this button, the closure returns a translation of the text as a string. Use that string to update the original text with the translated text as shown below:

```
struct ReplaceTranslation: View {
    @State private var translationVisible = false
    @State private var originalText = "Hallo, Welt!"

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            TextField("Text to translate", text: $originalText, axis: .vertical)
                .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
                .translationPresentation(isPresented: $translationVisible, text: originalText) { translatedString in
                    // Update the original text with the translated result.
                    originalText = translatedString
                }
            Button("Translate") {
                translationVisible.toggle()
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

If the system can’t detect the source language, it asks the user to select the language to translate from. For a list of supported languages see `LanguageAvailability.supportedLanguages`.

While this function does support long strings of text, it works best with short ones (no more than a couple of sentences or phrases in length).
