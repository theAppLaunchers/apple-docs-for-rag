## Overview

On macOS, materials have active and inactive appearances that can reinforce the active appearance of the window they are in:

- Materials used as a `window` container background and `bar` materials will appear inactive when their containing window is inactive.

- All other materials will always appear active by default.

An explicit active appearance can be set to override a materialâ€™s default behavior. For example, materials used as the `window` container background can be made to always appear active by setting the active appearance behavior to be always active:

```
Text("Hello, World!")
    .containerBackground(
        Material.regular.materialActiveAppearance(.active),
        for: .window)
```
