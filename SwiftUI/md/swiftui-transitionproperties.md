func matchedTransitionSource(id: some Hashable, in: Namespace.ID) -> some View

Identifies this view as the source of a navigation transition, such as a zoom transition.

func matchedTransitionSource(id: some Hashable, in: Namespace.ID, configuration: (EmptyMatchedTransitionSourceConfiguration) -> some MatchedTransitionSourceConfiguration) -> some View

protocol MatchedTransitionSourceConfiguration
