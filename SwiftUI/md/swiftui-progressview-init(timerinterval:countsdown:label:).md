Initializer

# init(timerInterval:countsDown:label:)

Creates a progress view for showing continuous progress as time passes, with a descriptive label.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 9.0+

``` source
nonisolated
init(
    timerInterval: ClosedRange,
    countsDown: Bool = true,
    @ViewBuilder label: () -> Label
)
```

Available when `Label` conforms to `View` and `CurrentValueLabel` is `DefaultDateProgressLabel`.

## Parameters 

`timerInterval`  

The date range over which the view progresses.

`countsDown`  

A Boolean value that determines whether the view empties or fills as time passes. If `true` (the default), the view empties.

`label`  

An optional view that describes the purpose of the progress view.

## Discussion

Use this initializer to create a view that shows continuous progress within a date range. The following example initializes a progress view with a range of `start...end`, where `start` is 30 seconds in the past and `end` is 90 seconds in the future. As a result, the progress view begins at 25 percent complete. This example also provides a custom descriptive label.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    let start = Date().addingTimeInterval(-30)
    let end = Date().addingTimeInterval(90)

    var body: some View {
        ProgressView(interval: start...end,
                     countsDown: false) {
            Text("Progress")
         }
    }
}
```

By default, the progress view empties as time passes from the start of the date range to the end, but you can use the `countsDown` parameter to create a progress view that fills as time passes, as the above example demonstrates.

The progress view provided by this initializer uses a text label that automatically updates to describe the current time remaining. To provide a custom label to show the current value, use init(value:total:label:currentValueLabel:) instead.

Note

Date-relative progress views, such as those created with this initializer, donâ€™t support custom styles.
