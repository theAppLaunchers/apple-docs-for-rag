Instance Method

# mapControls(\_:)

Configures all `Map` views in the associated environment to have standard size and position controls

MapKitSwiftUIiOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 17.0+watchOS 10.0+

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
func mapControls(@ViewBuilder _ content: () -> some View) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`content`  

A view builder returning the controls you wish your `Map`

## Discussion

You provide the controls you want to appear atop your map. When using a control in conjunction with `.mapControls` you donâ€™t need to specify a scope. Views that are not MapKit controls will be ignored.

```
Map()
.mapControls {
    MapScaleView()
    MapUserLocationButton()
}
```

Controls can be modified individually or all at once. Custom frames and alignments set on controls are ignored.

```
Map()
.mapControls {
    MapCompass()
        .mapControls(.visible)
    MapPitchToggle()
        .buttonBorderShape(.circular)
        .tint(.purple)
}
.controlSize(.large)
```

On watchOS, space is at a premium. When using the mapControls modifier, MapUserLocationButton and MapCompass are automatically combined if present.

```
Map()
.mapControls {
    MapUserLocationButton()
    MapCompass()
}
```
