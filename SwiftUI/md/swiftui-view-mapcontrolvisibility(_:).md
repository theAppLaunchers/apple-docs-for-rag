MapKitSwiftUIiOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 17.0+watchOS 10.0+

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
func mapControlVisibility(_ visibility: Visibility) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`visibility`  

How modified map controls should show or hide

## Discussion

MapCompass, MapScaleView, and MapPitchToggle may automatically show and hide based on the current state of the Map. That may not be appropriate for all use cases, where always showing a control may be desirable.

```
HStack {
    MapCompass()
    MapScaleView()
    MapPitchToggle()
}
.mapControls(.visible)
```

Other controls donâ€™t have an automatic visibility behavior, so they will always be visible when automatic is specified. Controls may also be hidden via this modifier when conditionalizing the view is not appropriate

```
MapUserLocationButton()
    .mapControls(.automatic)
MapZoomStepper()
    .mapControls(.hidden)
```
