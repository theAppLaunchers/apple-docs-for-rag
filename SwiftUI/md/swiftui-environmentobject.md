``` source
@MainActor @frozen @propertyWrapper @preconcurrency
struct EnvironmentObject where ObjectType : ObservableObject
```

## Overview

An environment object invalidates the current view whenever the observable object that conforms to ObservableObject changes. If you declare a property as an environment object, be sure to set a corresponding model object on an ancestor view by calling its environmentObject(_:) modifier.

Note

If your observable object conforms to the Observable protocol, use Environment instead of `EnvironmentObject` and set the model object in an ancestor view by calling its environment(_:) or environment(_:_:) modifiers.

## Topics
