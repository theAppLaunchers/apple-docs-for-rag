iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
nonisolated
func listRowSeparator(
    _ visibility: Visibility,
    edges: VerticalEdge.Set = .all
) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`visibility`  

The visibility of this rowâ€™s separators.

`edges`  

The set of row edges for which this preference applies. The list style might already decide to not display separators for some edges, typically the top edge. The default is all.

## Discussion

Separators can be presented above and below a row. You can specify to which edge this preference should apply.

This modifier expresses a preference to the containing List. The list style is the final arbiter of the separator visibility.

The following example shows a simple grouped list whose row separators are hidden:

```
List {
    ForEach(garage.cars) { car in
        Text(car.model)
            .listRowSeparator(.hidden)
    }
}
.listStyle(.grouped)
```

To change the color of a row separators, use listRowSeparatorTint(_:edges:). To hide or change the tint color for a section separators, use listSectionSeparator(_:edges:) and listSectionSeparatorTint(_:edges:).
