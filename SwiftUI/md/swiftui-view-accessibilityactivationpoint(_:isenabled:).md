Show all declarations

## Parameters 

`activationPoint`  

The accessibility activation point to apply.

`isEnabled`  

If true the accessibility activation point is applied; otherwise the accessibility activation point is unchanged.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to ensure that the activation point for a small element remains accurate even if you present a larger version of the element to VoiceOver.

If an activation point is not provided, an activation point will be derived from one of the accessibility elements decedents or from the center of the accessibility frame.

The modifier accepts an optional `AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions` option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.

struct AccessibilityZoomGestureAction

Position and direction information of a zoom gesture that someone performs with an assistive technology like VoiceOver.
