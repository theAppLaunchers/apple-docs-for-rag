Show all declarations

## Parameters 

`activationPoint`  

The accessibility activation point to apply.

`isEnabled`  

If true the accessibility activation point is applied; otherwise the accessibility activation point is unchanged.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to ensure that the activation point for a small element remains accurate even if you present a larger version of the element to VoiceOver.

If an activation point is not provided, an activation point will be derived from one of the accessibility elements decedents or from the center of the accessibility frame.

func accessibilityDirectTouch(Bool, options: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions) -> ModifiedContent&lt;Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>

Direct touch areas passthrough touch events to the app rather than being handled through an assistive technology, such as VoiceOver. The modifier accepts an optional `AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions` option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.

func accessibilityZoomAction((AccessibilityZoomGestureAction) -> Void) -> ModifiedContent&lt;Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>

Adds an accessibility zoom action to the view. Actions allow assistive technologies, such as VoiceOver, to interact with the view by invoking the action.

An option set that defines the functionality of a view’s direct touch area.

struct AccessibilityZoomGestureAction

Position and direction information of a zoom gesture that someone performs with an assistive technology like VoiceOver.
