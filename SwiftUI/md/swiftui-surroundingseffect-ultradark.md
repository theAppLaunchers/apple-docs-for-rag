An effect that dims passthrough video more than dark

visionOS 2.0+

``` source
static var ultraDark: SurroundingsEffect { get }
```

## Discussion

Use this value with the preferredSurroundingsEffect(_:) view modifier when you want to dim passthrough video while displaying a particular view. Doing so helps to draw attention to your appâ€™s content while still enabling people to remain aware of their surroundings. This effect will only be applied while an immersive space is opened.
