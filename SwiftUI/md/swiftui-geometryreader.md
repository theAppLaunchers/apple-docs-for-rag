struct GeometryReader3D

A container view that defines its content as a function of its own size and coordinate space.

struct GeometryProxy

A proxy for access to the size and coordinate space (for anchor resolution) of the container view.

struct GeometryProxy3D

A proxy for access to the size and coordinate space of the container view.

func coordinateSpace(NamedCoordinateSpace) -> some View

struct PhysicalMetric

Provides access to a value in points that corresponds to the specified physical measurement.

struct PhysicalMetricsConverter

A physical metrics converter provides conversion between point values and their extent in 3D space, in the form of physical length measurements.
