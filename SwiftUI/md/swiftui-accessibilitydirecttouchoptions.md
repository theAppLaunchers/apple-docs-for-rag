## Topics

### Getting the options

static let requiresActivation: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions

Prevents touch passthrough with the direct touch area until an assistive technology, such as VoiceOver, has activated the direct touch area through a user action, for example a double tap.

static let silentOnTouch: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions

Allows a direct touch area to immediately receive touch events without an assitive technology, such as VoiceOver, speaking. Appropriate for apps that provide direct audio feedback on touch that would conflict with speech feedback.

func accessibilityDirectTouch(Bool, options: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions) -> ModifiedContent&lt;Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>

The modifier accepts an optional `AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions` option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.

func accessibilityZoomAction((AccessibilityZoomGestureAction) -> Void) -> ModifiedContent&lt;Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>

struct AccessibilityZoomGestureAction

Position and direction information of a zoom gesture that someone performs with an assistive technology like VoiceOver.
