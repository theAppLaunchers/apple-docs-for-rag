Type Property

# bordered

The list style that describes the behavior and appearance of a list with standard border.

macOS 12.0+

``` source
static var bordered: BorderedListStyle { get }
```

Available when `Self` is `BorderedListStyle`.

## Discussion

Bordered lists are expected to be inset from their outer containers, but do not have inset style rows or selection.

To customize whether the rows of the list should alternate their backgrounds, use bordered(alternatesRowBackgrounds:).
