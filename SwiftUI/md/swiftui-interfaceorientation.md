## Overview

By default, device previews appear right side up, using orientation portrait. You can change the orientation with a call to the previewInterfaceOrientation(_:) modifier:

```
struct CircleImage_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        CircleImage()
            .previewInterfaceOrientation(.landscapeRight)
    }
}
```
