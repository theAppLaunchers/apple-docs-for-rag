``` source
nonisolated
func submitScope(_ isBlocking: Bool = true) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`isBlocking`  

A Boolean that indicates whether this scope is actively blocking submission triggers from reaching higher submission actions.

## Discussion

Use this modifier when you want to avoid specific views from initiating a submission action configured by the onSubmit(of:_:) modifier. In the example below, the tag field doesnâ€™t trigger the submission of the form:

```
Form {
    TextField("Username", text: $viewModel.userName)
    SecureField("Password", text: $viewModel.password)

    TextField("Tags", text: $viewModel.tags)
        .submitScope()
}
.onSubmit {
    guard viewModel.validate() else { return }
    viewModel.login()
}
```
