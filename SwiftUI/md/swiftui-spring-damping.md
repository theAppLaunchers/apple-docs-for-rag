Instance Property

# damping

Defines how the springâ€™s motion should be damped due to the forces of friction.

var damping: Double { get }
```

## Discussion

Reducing this value reduces the energy loss with each oscillation: the spring will overshoot its destination. Increasing the value increases the energy loss with each duration: there will be fewer and smaller oscillations.
