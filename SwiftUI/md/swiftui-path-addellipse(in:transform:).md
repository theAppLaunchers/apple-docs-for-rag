``` source
mutating func addEllipse(
    in rect: CGRect,
    transform: CGAffineTransform = .identity
)
```

## Discussion

The ellipse is approximated by a sequence of Bézier curves. Its center is the midpoint of the rectangle defined by the `rect` parameter. If the rectangle is square, then the ellipse is circular with a radius equal to one-half the width (or height) of the rectangle. If the `rect` parameter specifies a rectangular shape, then the major and minor axes of the ellipse are defined by the width and height of the rectangle.

The ellipse forms a complete subpath of the path— that is, the ellipse drawing starts with a move-to operation and ends with a close-subpath operation, with all moves oriented in the clockwise direction.

- Parameter:

  - rect: A rectangle that defines the area for the ellipse to fit in.

  - transform: An affine transform to apply to the ellipse before adding to the path. Defaults to the identity transform if not specified.
