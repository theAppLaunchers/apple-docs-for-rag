Instance Method

# enumerateNeighbors(for:maximumCount:distanceType:using:)

Passes the nearest strings of a location in the vocabulary space to a closure.

``` source
@nonobjc
func enumerateNeighbors(
    for vector: [Double],
    maximumCount maxCount: Int,
    distanceType: NLDistanceType = .cosine,
    using block: (String, NLDistance) -> Bool
)
```

## Parameters 

`vector`  

A location in the vocabulary space.

`maxCount`  

The largest number of times the method calls `block`.

`distanceType`  

A means of calculating distance that determines which formula the method uses to evaluate a neighborâ€™s distance from `vector`.

`block`  

A closure with the following parameters:

`String`  
A neighboring string.

`NLDistance`  
The distance from `vector` to the neighboring string.

The closure returns a Boolean that indicates whether to stop enumerating neighbors.
