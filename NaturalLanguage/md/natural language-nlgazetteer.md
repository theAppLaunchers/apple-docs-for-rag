## Overview

Use an NLGazetteer to augment an NLTagger when you need to tag a specific set of terms (single words or short phrases) with a label. Typically, you add one gazetteer per language, or one language-independent gazetteer, to an NLTagger with its setGazetteers(_:for:) method. The tagger uses its gazetteers to look up each term it processes. If a gazetteer has a label for a term, the tagger uses that label to tag the term, instead of inferring a tag itself.

Typically, you create a gazetteer at development time, such as in a macOS playground, with Create MLâ€™s MLGazetteer. Alternatively, you can create an NLGazetteer at runtime by using init(dictionary:language:).

### Creating a Gazetteer

init(contentsOf: URL) throws

Creates a Natural Language gazetteer from a model created with the Create ML framework.

init(data: Data) throws

Creates a gazetteer from a data instance.

init(dictionary: [String : [String]], language: NLLanguage?) throws

Creates a gazetteer from a set of labels for terms represented by a dictionary.

class func write([String : [String]], language: NLLanguage?, to: URL) throws
