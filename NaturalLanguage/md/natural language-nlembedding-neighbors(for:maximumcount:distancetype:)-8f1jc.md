func neighbors(
    for string: String,
    maximumCount maxCount: Int,
    distanceType: NLDistanceType = .cosine
) -> [(String, NLDistance)]
```

## Parameters 

`string`  

A string in the embedding vocabulary.

`maxCount`  

The largest number of neighboring strings that the method can return in an array.

`distanceType`  

A means of calculating distance that determines which formula the method uses to evaluate a neighborâ€™s distance from `string`.

## Return Value

An array of tuples that contain neighboring strings and their distances.
