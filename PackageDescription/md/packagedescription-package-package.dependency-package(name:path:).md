Type Method

# package(name:path:)

Adds a dependency to a package located at the given path on the filesystem.

SwiftPM 5.2+

``` source
static func package(
    name: String,
    path: String
) -> Package.Dependency
```

## Parameters 

`name`  

The name of the Swift package.

`path`  

The file system path to the package.

## Return Value

A package dependency.

## Discussion

Swift Package Manager uses the package dependency as-is and doesnâ€™t perform any source control access. Local package dependencies are especially useful during development of a new package or when working on multiple tightly coupled packages.
