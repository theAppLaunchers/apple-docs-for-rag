Type Method

# define(\_:\_:)

Defines a compilation condition.

SwiftPM 5.0+

``` source
static func define(
    _ name: String,
    _ condition: BuildSettingCondition? = nil
) -> SwiftSetting
```

## Parameters 

`name`  

The name of the macro.

`condition`  

A condition that restricts the application of the build setting.

## Discussion

Use compilation conditions to only compile statements if a certain condition is true. For example, the Swift compiler will only compile the statements inside the `#if` block when `ENABLE_SOMETHING` is defined:

```
#if ENABLE_SOMETHING
   ...
#endif
```

Unlike macros in C/C++, compilation conditions donâ€™t have an associated value.

First available in PackageDescription 5.0.
