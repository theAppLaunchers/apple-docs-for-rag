## Discussion

An upcoming feature is one that is available in Swift as of a certain language version, but isnâ€™t available by default in prior language modes because it has some impact on source compatibility.

You can add and use multiple upcoming features in a given target without affecting its dependencies. Targets will ignore any unknown upcoming features.

Since

First available in PackageDescription 5.8.
