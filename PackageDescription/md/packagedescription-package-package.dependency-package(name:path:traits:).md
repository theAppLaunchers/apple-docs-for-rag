SwiftPM 6.1+

``` source
static func package(
    name: String,
    path: String,
    traits: Set = [.defaults]
) -> Package.Dependency
```

## Parameters 

`name`  

The name of the Swift package.

`path`  

The file system path to the package.

`traits`  

The trait configuration of this dependency. Defaults to enabling the default traits.

## Return Value

## Discussion

Swift Package Manager uses the package dependency as-is and doesnâ€™t perform any source control access. Local package dependencies are especially useful during development of a new package or when working on multiple tightly coupled packages.
