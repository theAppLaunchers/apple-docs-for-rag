iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+tvOS 17.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
@MainActor
func accessibilityZoomIn(at point: CGPoint) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`point`  

The point where a person performs the zoom in action.

## Return Value

YES if this method successfully handles zooming; otherwise, NO. By default, this method returns NO.

## Discussion

If your element has the supportsZoom trait, you need to implement this method and accessibilityZoomOut(at:). Use this method to zoom in at the specified point. For example, if the element allows an expand gesture to zoom in to the viewâ€™s content, implement this method so that the VoiceOver zoom action receives the same behavior.
