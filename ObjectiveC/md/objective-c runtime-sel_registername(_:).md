``` source
func sel_registerName(_ str: UnsafePointer) -> Selector
```

## Parameters 

`str`  

A pointer to a C string. Pass the name of the method you wish to register.

## Return Value

A pointer of type SEL specifying the selector for the named method.

## Discussion

You must register a method name with the Objective-C runtime system to obtain the methodâ€™s selector before you can add the method to a class definition. If the method name has already been registered, this function simply returns the selector.
