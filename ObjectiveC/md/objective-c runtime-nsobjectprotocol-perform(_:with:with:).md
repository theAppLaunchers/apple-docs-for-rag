``` source
func perform(
    _ aSelector: Selector!,
    with object1: Any!,
    with object2: Any!
) -> Unmanaged!
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`aSelector`  

A selector identifying the message to send. If `aSelector` is `NULL`, an invalidArgumentException is raised.

`object1`  

An object that is the first argument of the message.

`object2`  

An object that is the second argument of the message

## Return Value

An object that is the result of the message.

## Discussion

This method is the same as perform(_:) except that you can supply two arguments for `aSelector`. `aSelector` should identify a method that can take two arguments of type id. For methods with other argument types and return values, use NSInvocation.
