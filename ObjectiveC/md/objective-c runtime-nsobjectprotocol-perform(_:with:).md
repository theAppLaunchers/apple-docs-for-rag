``` source
func perform(
    _ aSelector: Selector!,
    with object: Any!
) -> Unmanaged!
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`aSelector`  

A selector identifying the message to send. If `aSelector` is `NULL`, an invalidArgumentException is raised.

`object`  

An object that is the sole argument of the message.

## Return Value

An object that is the result of the message.

## Discussion

This method is the same as perform(_:) except that you can supply an argument for `aSelector`. `aSelector` should identify a method that takes a single argument of type id. For methods with other argument types and return values, use NSInvocation.
