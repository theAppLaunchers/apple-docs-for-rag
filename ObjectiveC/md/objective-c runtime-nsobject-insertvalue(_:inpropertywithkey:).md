func insertValue(
    _ value: Any,
    inPropertyWithKey key: String
)
```

## Discussion

The method `insertIn:` is used if it exists. Otherwise, raises an `NSUndefinedKeyException`. This is part of Cocoaâ€™s scripting support for inserting newly-created objects into containers without explicitly specifying a location.
