## Overview

A quality-of-service (QoS) class categorizes work to perform on a DispatchQueue. By specifying the quality of a task, you indicate its importance to your app. When scheduling tasks, the system prioritizes those that have higher service classes.

Because higher priority work is performed more quickly and with more resources than lower priority work, it typically requires more energy than lower priority work. Accurately specifying appropriate QoS classes for the work your app performs ensures that your app is responsive and energy efficient.

## Topics

### Getting the Predefined QoS Objects

static let userInteractive: DispatchQoS

The quality-of-service class for user-interactive tasks, such as animations, event handling, or updates to your appâ€™s user interface.

static let userInitiated: DispatchQoS

The quality-of-service class for tasks that prevent the user from actively using your app.

static let `default`: DispatchQoS

The default quality-of-service class.

static let utility: DispatchQoS

The quality-of-service class for tasks that the user does not track actively.

static let background: DispatchQoS

The quality-of-service class for maintenance or cleanup tasks that you create.

static let unspecified: DispatchQoS

The absence of a quality-of-service class.

### Creating a QoS Structure

init(qosClass: DispatchQoS.QoSClass, relativePriority: Int)

Creates a new `DispatchQoS` object with the specified QoS class and relative priority.

enum QoSClass

Quality-of-service classes that specify the priorities for executing tasks.

### Getting the QoS Attributes

let qosClass: DispatchQoS.QoSClass

The quality-of-service class.

let relativePriority: Int

The priority of a quality of service relative to others with the same class.
