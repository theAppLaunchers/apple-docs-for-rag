## Discussion

Cancellation prevents any further invocation of the event handler block for the dispatch source, but does not interrupt any work that is already in progress. If a cancellation handler was set before cancellation, it is sub mitted to the target queue once any in-progress event handler work is finished. Once the cancellation handler is submitted, it is safe to close the sourceâ€™s handle (file descriptor or mach port). It is invalid to close a file descriptor or deallocate a mach port that is currently being tracked by a dispatch source object before the cancellation handler is invoked.
