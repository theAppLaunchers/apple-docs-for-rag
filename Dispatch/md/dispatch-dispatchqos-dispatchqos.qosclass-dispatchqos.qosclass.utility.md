## Discussion

Utility tasks have a lower priority than default, user-initiated, and user-interactive tasks, but a higher priority than background tasks. Assign this quality-of-service class to tasks that do not prevent the user from continuing to use your app. For example, you might assign this class to long-running tasks whose progress the user does not follow actively.
