# ActivityAuthorizationInfo

An object with information about whether a person allowed your app to start Live Activities and permitted content updates with frequent ActivityKit push notifications.

iOS 16.1+iPadOS 16.1+

``` source
final class ActivityAuthorizationInfo
```

## Overview

By default, your app can start, update, and end a Live Activity if you use ActivityKit to offer Live Activities. However, a person can deactivate Live Activities for an app in Settings. To check if your app can start, update, or end a Live Activity, use the synchronous areActivitiesEnabled property or the asynchronous activityEnablementUpdates sequence.

Similarly, `ActivityAuthorizationInfo` provides functionality to check whether a person has permitted your app to update Live Activities with frequent ActivityKit push notifications. To check whether you can send frequent ActivityKit push notifications to update Live Activity content, use the synchronous frequentPushesEnabled property or the asynchronous frequentPushEnablementUpdates sequence.

Note

To update a Live Activity with frequent ActivityKit push notifications, add the `NSSupportsFrequentLiveActivityUpdates` key with a Boolean value of `YES` to your appâ€™s `Info.plist` file. For additional information, see Starting and updating Live Activities with ActivityKit push notifications.
