```

## Overview

The `ActivityAttributes` protocol describes the content that appears in your Live Activity. Its inner type ContentState represents the dynamic content of the Live Activity.

The following example shows an implementation of the `ActivityAttributes` protocol for a pizza delivery app. The appâ€™s Live Activity shows the number of ordered pizzas and the total amount on the bill as static data and the name of the driver and an estimated delivery time as dynamic data that changes over time. Note how the implementation defines the type alias `PizzaDeliveryStatus` to make the code more descriptive and easier to read.

```
public import Foundation
import ActivityKit

struct PizzaDeliveryAttributes: ActivityAttributes {
    public typealias PizzaDeliveryStatus = ContentState

    public struct ContentState: Codable, Hashable {
        var driverName: String
        var deliveryTimer: ClosedRange
    }

    var numberOfPizzas: Int
    var totalAmount: String
    var orderNumber: String
}
```
