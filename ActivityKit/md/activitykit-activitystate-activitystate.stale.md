## Discussion

The content of a Live Activity may become out of date before you can update it. For example, a person may be in an area without a network connection, causing the Live Activity to not receive updates. To tell people that they are looking at outdated Live Activity content, you can configure a staleDate for your Live Activity. At the specified date, the activityState changes to `stale` and you can update the Live Activity to indicate that its content is out of date.
