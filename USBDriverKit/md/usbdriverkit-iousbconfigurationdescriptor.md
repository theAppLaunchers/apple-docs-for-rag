Structure

# IOUSBConfigurationDescriptor

The structure for storing a USB configuration descriptor.

DriverKit 19.0+

``` source
struct IOUSBConfigurationDescriptor;
```

## Overview

This descriptor contains information about a specific configuration of a device, including the interfaces that configuration provides. This structure has a variable length, so it defines only the known fields. Use the `wTotalLength` field to read the entire descriptor.

For more information about this descriptor type, see section 9.6.3 of the USB 2.0 specification at http://www.usb.org.

## Topics
