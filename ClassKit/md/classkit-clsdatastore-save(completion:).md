## Discussion

Important

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
func save() async throws
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

Important

ClassKit calls your completion handler on an arbitrary thread. If you need to do work on a particular thread from inside the handler, dispatch that work to the appropriate queue.
