``` source
var topic: CLSContextTopic? { get set }
```

## Discussion

Set the topic to tell teachers what kind of content a given context covers using one of the values from CLSContextTopic. The topic set on a context applies to that context and any of its descendants for which you havenâ€™t explicitly set a topic. So if your entire app covers only a single topic, you only need to set the topic for the mainAppContext.
