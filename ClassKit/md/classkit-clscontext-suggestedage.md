Instance Property

# suggestedAge

The range of ages, measured in years, for which you deem a context’s content suitable.

var suggestedAge: NSRange { get set }
```

## Discussion

Use this property to optionally suggest an age range for a context’s content. This guides teachers as they look for content for their students, although teachers are free to ignore your suggestion. If you provide a range, use integer ages measured in years as bounds. For example, you could consider a game as suitable for students from ages 4 to 6:

```
gameContext.suggestedAge = NSRange(4...6) // For ages 4 to 6.
```

To indicate no lower bound, provide a value of `0`. To indicate no upper bound, provide the largest possible value. Use both at the same time to indicate a context’s suitability for all ages:

```
youthContext.suggestedAge = NSRange(0...10) // Up to and including age 10.
adultContext.suggestedAge = NSRange(18...Int.max - 1) // Ages 18 and over.
allAgesContext.suggestedAge = NSRange(0...Int.max - 1) // For everyone.
```

New contexts that you create have the “all ages” setting by default.

Note

Because NSRange defines its upper bound as one more than the last value contained in the range, use `Int.max - 1` to indicate the unbounded case and prevent the upper bound from overflowing.
