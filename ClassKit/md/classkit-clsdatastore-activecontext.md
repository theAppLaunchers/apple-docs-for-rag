# activeContext

The currently active context.

``` source
var activeContext: CLSContext? { get }
```

## Discussion

This value is `nil` if there is no currently active context.

To activate a context when a student begins working on the content that the context represents, call its becomeActive() method. To deactivate a context when the student finishes, call its resignActive() function. Only one context may be active at a time, so if you activate a context, the system automatically causes any previously active context to resign.
