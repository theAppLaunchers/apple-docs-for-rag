## Discussion

All contexts with a given parent context must have different identifiers. No such requirement exists for contexts that have different parent contexts. So, for example, the `chapter-1` and `chapter-2` contexts can each have child contexts with the identifier `section-1`, but `chapter-1` canâ€™t have two contexts with that identifier.
