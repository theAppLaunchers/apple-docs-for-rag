## Discussion

The value of this property is dependent on whether you specify a departure date or arrival date in your MKDirections.Request object. If you specify a departure date, the framework copies that date to this property. If you specify an arrival date, but not a departure date, the framework computes the departure date by subtracting the expected travel time from your arrival date. If you donâ€™t specify an arrival date or departure date, the framework sets this property to the current time.
