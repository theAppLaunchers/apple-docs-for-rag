## Discussion

The default value of this property is `nil`, which prevents MapKit from clustering the annotation view with other annotation views. Setting the property to a non-`nil` value enables it to participate in clustering.

Clustering occurs when thereâ€™s a collision between multiple annotation views with the same identifier on the map surface. MapKit removes the annotation views involved in the collision from the map view and replaces them with a clustering annotation view, which displays the title from one of the annotations and provides access to the other annotations.
