```

## Parameters 

`mapView`

`annotation`  

The annotation.

## Discussion

Called for all selected annotations. Not all types of annotations support displaying selection accessories. For example, the map item detail selection accessory is only supported for MKMapItemAnnotation and MKMapFeatureAnnotation. Please return \`nil\` for annotations where a selection accessory is not desired.

No accessory will be displayed ifâ€¦

- nil is returned

- mapView(_:selectionAccessoryFor:) is not implemented

- the accessory returned is not supported for \`annotation\`
