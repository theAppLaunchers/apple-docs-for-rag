```

## Discussion

On Retina displays, the system renders images pixel for pixel and doesnâ€™t scale them. This means that if the tile size is 256 x 256 pixels and the scale factor is `2.0`, the system renders the image as if it is 128 x 128 points in size. This behavior causes the tile to appear smaller, but preserves the original image data.

The default tile size is 256 x 256 pixels.
