var annotation: (any MKAnnotation)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

Donâ€™t change the value of this property directly. This property contains a non-`nil` value only while the annotation view is visible on the map. If the map view queues this annotation view and is waiting to reuse it, the value is `nil`.
