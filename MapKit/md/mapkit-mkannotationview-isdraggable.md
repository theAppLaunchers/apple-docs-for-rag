## Discussion

Setting this property to true makes an annotation draggable by the user. If true, the associated annotation object needs to also implement the setCoordinate: method. The default value of this property is false.

Setting this property to true lets the map view know that the annotation is draggable. You canâ€™t conditionalize drag operations by attempting to stop an operation the user initiates. Doing so can lead to undefined behavior. After it begins, the drag operation needs to continue to completion.
