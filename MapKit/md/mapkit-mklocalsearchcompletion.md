## Overview

You donâ€™t create instances of this class directly. Instead, you use an MKLocalSearchCompleter to initiate a search based on a set of partial search strings. That object stores any matches in its results property. Retrieve any `MKLocalSearchCompletion` objects from that property and display the search terms in your interface, or use one to initiate a search for content based on that search term.

When displaying text completions for a partial search term in your user interface, you might want to use a bold version of a font or add some other highlighting to the portion of the completion string that causes it to match the partial search term. To help you add this styling, the completion object includes highlight ranges for the title and subtitle strings.

## Topics

### Getting the search completions

var subtitle: String

The subtitle (if any) associated with the point of interest.

var subtitleHighlightRanges: [NSValue]

The ranges of characters to highlight in the subtitle string.
