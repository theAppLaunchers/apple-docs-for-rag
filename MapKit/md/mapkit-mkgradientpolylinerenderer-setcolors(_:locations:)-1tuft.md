``` source
func setColors(
    _ colors: [NSColor],
    locations: [CGFloat]
)
```

## Parameters 

`colors`  

An array of colors making up the transition points of the gradient.

`locations`  

An array of unit distance values that correspond to the provided colors.

## Discussion

The unit distance value of `0` represents the start of the polyline, and `1` represents the end of the polyline. A gradient may have any number of steps along the length of the polyline.

To determine a location along the polyline, use location(atPointIndex:), or retrieve a set of locations using locations.
