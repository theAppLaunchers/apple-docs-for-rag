# Adopting unified Maps URLs

Access Maps URLs and options for displaying Maps information across Apple platforms.

## Overview

In iOS 18.4 and later, macOS 15.4 and later, and watchOS 11.4 and later, the Maps platform provides a new, unified collection of URLs that offers the same functionality on all devices. Use the Maps path components to control aspects of the Maps display, ranging from the presentation of a simple map centered on a location you provide, to finding specific points of interest (POIs) and providing complex multistop driving, walking, or transit directions.

## Frame the map display

Use the `/frame` path component and `query` parameters to control aspects of the map’s framing and representation. This component allows you to set a map’s orientation, style, visible area (the map’s span), and other perspective controls, as described in the table below.

| Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
| `center` | Frames the map on a specific center described by comma-separated coordinate pair, such as `40.773957,-73.970974`. |
| `span` | Specifies the size of the area around the center point of the search in degrees of longitude and latitude, for example `0.05,0.05`, which is approximately one km for these examples. For more information on what these distances mean at different latitudes, see init(latitudeDelta:longitudeDelta:). |
| `mode` | Sets the map’s mode to optionally allow location tracking: values can be `follow` or `follow-with-heading`, or `none`. |
| `heading` | Sets the direction toward which the map orients. |
| `pitch` | Sets the the vertical angle the map is oriented to. |
| `distance` | Sets the apparent distance from the viewer to the map surface; this parameter also affects the map’s `span`. |
| `map` |  Sets the type of map to display: values can be `explore`, `driving`, `transit`, `satellite`, or `hybrid`. |

The following `/frame` path component examples demonstrate different kinds of map framing, along with details, where necessary, on how specific parameters affect what the map displays.

- Center the map at specific coordinate — https://maps.apple.com/frame?center=40.753035,-73.981846.

- Set map mode to transit and center map at specific coordinate — https://maps.apple.com/frame?map=transit&amp;center=40.753035,-73.981846.

- Set the map mode to `explore` and set user tracking to `follow` — https://maps.apple.com/frame?coordinate=40.753035,-73.981846&amp;map=explore&amp;mode=follow&amp;span=0.024461,0.043938.

- Set map mode to `explore`; this setting cause the map to focus on a specified coordinate, and sets the map camera attributes — https://maps.apple.com/frame?map=explore&amp;center=40.753035,-73.981846&amp;heading=180&amp;pitch=15&amp;distance=10000.

- Set the map mode to `explore`, and set location tracking mode to `follow` — https://maps.apple.com/frame?map=explore&amp;center=40.753035,-73.981846&amp;heading=18a0&amp;pitch=15&amp;distance=10000&amp;mode=follow. If you’re setting tracking mode and camera properties, the tracking mode takes precedence. Setting camera properties requires a center coordinate.

- Center the map at a specific coordinate and frame the map to the specified span —  https://maps.apple.com/frame?center=40.753035,-73.981846&amp;span=0.05,0.05. It’s also possible to frame the map using the `distance` parameter, for example, https://maps.apple.com/frame?center=40.753035,-73.981846&amp;distance=17825.

- Set the map mode to `explore`, which centers the map at a specified coordinate, and sets the map camera elevation, heading, and angle; in this example, facing East (90˚), a distance of 1 km, and a map pitch of 15˚ — https://maps.apple.com/frame?map=explore&amp;center=40.753035,-73.981846&amp;heading=90&amp;pitch=15&amp;distance=10000.

- Center the map at a specific coordinate and set the camera `distance` — https://maps.apple.com/frame?map=explore&amp;center=40.753035,-73.981846&amp;distance=10000.

- Center the map at a specific coordinate and set the camera to the specified properties — https://maps.apple.com/frame?center=40.753035,-73.981846&amp;distance=5000&amp;pitch=15&amp;heading=180&amp;span=1.0,1.0. If you provide both the `span` and `camera` properties, the `camera` properties take precedence, since they’re more specific than a `span`.

## Perform general searches

You can use the `/search` path component to search for specific kinds of locations using several `query` parameters.

| Parameter | Description |  |
|----|----|----|
| `query` | A search string. This parameter can be a general point of interest (POI) such as `pizza`, or a specific location such as an address string, such as `1000 Fifth Avenue, NY, NY`, or a city name such as `San Francisco`. For a list of POIs, see MKPointOfInterestCategory. |  |
| `span` | A span that specifies the size of the area around the center point of the search in degrees of longitude and latitude, for example `0.05,0.05` which is approximately 1 km for these examples. For more information on what these distances mean at different latitudes, see init(latitudeDelta:longitudeDelta:). |  |

The following `/search` path component examples demonstrate how to use the `search` path component to find `pizza`, one of Maps’ POI identifiers, using different kinds of location and distance descriptions.

- Show results for `pizza` around a person’s location: https://maps.apple.com/search?query=pizza. The default center point is a person’s location.

- Show results for `pizza` centered on Trafalgar Square in London, United Kingdom — https://maps.apple.com/search?query=pizza&amp;center=51.507984,-0.128015.

- Show results for `pizza` within approximately 1 km around Washington Square Park in New York City — https://maps.apple.com/search?query=pizza&amp;center=40.730877,-73.997603&amp;span=0.05,0.05.

## Show the place card of a POI

Using the `/place` path component enables you to specify a place card that shows useful details about points of interest on the map. Use the parameters in the following table to specify a POI and optionally the place card name and map type.

| Parameter | Description |  |
|----|----|----|
| `coordinate` | The latitude and longitude of the location, as a comma-separated pair of floating point values that represent latitude and longitude. |  |
| `address` | The address of the location, such as “1000 Fifth Ave, New York, NY”. |  |
| `place-id` | A Place ID is a unique identifier for a POI, such as `I521E602783BA9605`, The Metropolitan Museum of Art at 1000 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10028, United States; for more information on Place IDs, see Identifying unique locations with Place IDs. |  |
| `map` | The type of map to display. Maps supports `explore`, `driving`, `transit`, `satellite`, or `hybrid` as the map type. |  |

The following examples demonstrate different place card details along with details, where necessary, on how specific parameters affect what the maps displays.

- Show the address 1000 Fifth Ave, NY, NY, which is located at the specified coordinate and associated POIs near this address —  https://maps.apple.com/place?coordinate=40.779092,-73.962932.

- Show 1000 Fifth Ave, NY, NY, 10028 using an address string and display associated POIs near this address: https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1000%20Fifth%20Ave,%20NY,NY,10028%20United%20States.

- Show the place at PlaceID `IF149E70A3B3C4CB2` — American Museum of Natural History, 200 Central Park W, New York, NY 10024, United States — https://maps.apple.com/place?place-id=IF149E70A3B3C4CB2. To find a specific Place ID, you can use MKMapItem in AppKit and UIKit, Place in MapKitJS, or see Place ID Lookup.

- Show a place card at the specified coordinate with custom name you provide — https://maps.apple.com/place?coordinate=40.864791,-73.931723&amp;name=My%20Favorite%20Place. You can use this parameter when dropping a pin if you need to display a custom name for the place card.

- Show a person’s current location — https://maps.apple.com/place?place-id=my-location. This parameter requires that a person has given permission for Maps to display their location.

- Show the location of a person’s parked car — https://maps.apple.com/place?place-id=parked-car. This parameter requires that a person has given Maps permission to record the place they parked.

## Explore the environment using Look Around

Use the `/look-around` path component and one of the following parameters to specify the initial location to start a session using Look Around.

| Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
| `coordinate` | The latitude and longitude of the location as a comma-separated pair of floating point values that represent latitude and longitude. |
| `address` | The address of the location. This parameter is an address string, such as “1000 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10028”. |
| `place-id` | A Place ID, which is a unique identifier for a point of interest, such as `I521E602783BA9605`, The Metropolitan Museum of Art at 1000 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10028, United States; for more information on Place IDs, see Identifying unique locations with Place IDs. |

You can specify multiple `waypoint` parameters for different waypoints.

- Show multistop driving directions, in New York City, from Riverside Park to The American Museum of Natural History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and The New York Public Library — https://maps.apple.com/directions?source=328%10Riverside%20Drive,%20New%20York,NY%2010025&amp;destination=200%20Central%20Park%20W%20New%20York,%20NY%2010024%20United%20States&amp;waypoint=40.779092,-73.962932&amp;waypoint=476%20Fifth%20Ave%20New%20York,%20NY%2010018%20United%20States&amp;mode=driving.

- Show transit directions from the New York Public Library to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City — https://maps.apple.com/directions?source=200%20Central%20Park%20W%20New%20York,%20NY%2010024%20United%20States&amp;destination=200%20Central%20Park%20W%20New%20York,%20NY%2010024%20United%20States&amp;mode=transit. Leaving off the `source` instructs Maps to display directions using public transit to the specified destination from a person’s current location, which might not be practical depending on a person’s location.

- Show driving directions from The American Museum of Natural History in New York City to Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York, avoiding tolls, if possible — https://maps.apple.com/directions?source=476%20Fifth%20Ave%20New%20York,%20NY%2010018%20United%20States&amp;destination=40.596896,-73.514907&amp;mode=driving&amp;avoid=tolls.

You can use ‘,’ as a separator to specify multiple `avoid` options.

- Show walking directions from, a person’s current location to 1 La Avanzada St, San Francisco, CA avoiding highways, hills, stairs, and busy roads, if possible — https://maps.apple.com/directions?destination=1%20La%20Avanzada%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094131,%20United%20States&amp;mode=walking&amp;avoid=highways,hills,stairs,busy-roads. The `avoid` options are only applicable to their respective transportation modes.

- Show transit directions from a person’s current location to Sausalito, preferring bus and ferry — https://maps.apple.com/directions?destination=Sausalito,%20CA,%20United%20States&amp;transit-preferences=bus,ferry&amp;mode=transit. Leaving off the `source` instructs Maps to display directions using public transit to the specified destination from a person’s current location, which might not be practical depending on their location.

## Find guides and curated places

Using the `/guides` path component, you can ask Maps to provide details about place guides and curated collections using the following URL: https://maps.apple.com/guides.

## Report a problem

If you find an issue with Apple Maps, you can report a problem using the `/report-a-problem path` component, followed by any of the following parameters:

| Parameters | Description | Values |
|----|----|----|
| `coordinate` | The latitude and longitude of the location | A comma-separated pair of floating point values that represent latitude and longitude |
| `address` | The address of the location | An address string, such as 1000 Fifth Avenue |
| `place-id` | The unique Place ID for a point of interest; for example, the place ID `I8CAD8EFA77AA3D42` represents Bethesda Terrace in New York City’s Central Park | For more information on Place IDs, see Identifying unique locations with Place IDs |

### Example problem reports

You can report a problem using the same kinds of location descriptors the other queries use. The following examples show how to report a problem using a coordinate, an address, or a Place ID.

- Report a problem at the coordinate `40.753035,-73.981846` (The New York Public Library at 42nd St & 5th Ave in New York City) - https://maps.apple.com/report-a-problem?coordinate=37.316115,-122.050910

- Report a problem at the address 1000 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10028 United States — https://maps.apple.com/report-a-problem?address=1000%20Fifth%20Ave%20New%20York%20NY%2100284%20United%20States

- Report a problem at Place ID `IBE1F65094A7A13B1`, the San Francisco Ferry Building — https://maps.apple.com/report-a-problem?place-id=IBE1F65094A7A13B1

When you open the `report-a-problem` URL, Maps opens a problem report sheet to ask a person for more detail on the nature of the problem, which Apple uses to investigate the report.
