## Return Value

true if the map view can skip the loading and drawing of the underlying map tiles, or false if the map view needs to draw the tiles.

## Discussion

The map view uses the return value of this method as a hint to determine whether it loads and renders its tiles. If your overlay covers its designated region entirely with opaque content, and effectively replaces the content of underlying map tiles, implement this method and return true. Doing so alleviates the need for the map to render its tiles.

If you donâ€™t implement this method, or if you return false from it, the map view continues to load and render its tiles.
