## Discussion

Use this property to specify the map using geographical coordinates. If you assign a value for this property, the snapshotter updates the value in the mapRect property to match the corresponding area as closely as possible.

The snapshotter sets the default value of this property to an area that encompasses the userâ€™s country or region, based on the current locale information.
