## Discussion

If the tile content you provide can cover the entire drawing area with opaque content, set this property to true. Doing so serves as a hint to the map view that it doesnâ€™t need to draw any additional content underneath your tiles. Set this property to false if your tiles contain any transparency.

The default value for this property is false.
