## Discussion

The scale factor determines how the overlay renders map content from the logical coordinate space (in points) to the device coordinate space (in pixels). This value is typically either `1.0` or `2.0`. Higher scale factors indicate that each point represents more than one pixel on the screen. For example, if the scale factor is `2.0` and the drawing rectangle size is 50 x 50 points, the size of the underlying area is 100 x 100 pixels.

When drawing the content for your overlays, you can use this value to determine how best to render your content.
