## Discussion

If you use different overlay objects to represent different tiles at different zoom levels, use this property to specify the minimum zoom level supported by this overlayâ€™s tiles. At zoom level 0, tiles cover the entire world map; at zoom level 1, tiles cover 1/4 of the world; at zoom level 2, tiles cover 1/16 of the world, and so on. The map never tries to load tiles for a zoom level less than the value specified by this property.

The default value of this property is `0`.
