``` source
class MKMultiPoint
```

## Overview

Donâ€™t create instances of this class directly. Instead, create instances of the MKPolygon or MKPolyline classes. However, you can use the methods and property of this class to access information about the specific points associated with the line or polygon.

## Topics

### Accessing the points in the shape

func points() -> UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;MKMapPoint>

Returns an array of map points associated with the shape.

var pointCount: Int

The number of points associated with the shape.

func location(atPointIndex: Int) -> CGFloat

Translates a point index into a unit distance along the shape.

func locations(at: IndexSet) -> [CGFloat]

Translates a point index set into a unit distance along the shape.

### Getting coordinate values

func getCoordinates(UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;CLLocationCoordinate2D>, range: NSRange)

Retrieves one or more points associated with the shape and converts them to coordinate values.
