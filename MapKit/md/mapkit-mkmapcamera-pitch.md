# pitch

``` source
var pitch: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

A value of `0` results in a camera that points straight down at the map. Angles greater than `0` result in a camera that pitches toward the horizon by the specified number of degrees. If the map type is MKMapType.satellite or MKMapType.hybrid, the object clamps the pitch value to `0`.

The class may clamp the value in this property to a maximum value to maintain map readability. Thereâ€™s no fixed maximum value, though, because the actual maximum value is dependent on the altitude of the camera.
