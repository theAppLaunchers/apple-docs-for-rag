## Discussion

Use this property to specify the map using map view points. If you assign a value for this property, the snapshotter updates the value in the region property to match the corresponding map rectangle as closely as possible.

The snapshotter sets the default value of this property to a map rectangle that encompasses the userâ€™s country or region, based on the current locale information.
