## Overview

Each `MKRoute.Step` object corresponds to a single instruction that the person needs to follow when navigating between two points. For example, a step might involve following a single road until continuing along the route requires a turn.

You donâ€™t create instances of this class directly. An MKRoute object contains the `MKRoute.Step` objects associated with a route. For more information about requesting directions, see MKDirections.
