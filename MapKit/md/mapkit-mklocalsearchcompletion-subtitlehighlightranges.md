## Discussion

This property contains an array of NSValue objects, each of which contains an NSRange type defining a range of characters in the subtitle string. Use this property to identify the ranges of characters in the subtitle string that you want to highlight. Highlighting the matching text of a search completion is optional, but itâ€™s a best practice for providing helpful information to the user.
