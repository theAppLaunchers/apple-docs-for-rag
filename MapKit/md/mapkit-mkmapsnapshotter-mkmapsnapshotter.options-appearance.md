Instance Property

# appearance

The visual style (light or dark) to apply to the map when rendering the snapshot image.

macOS 10.14+

``` source
var appearance: NSAppearance? { get set }
```

## Discussion

Use this property to specify a light or dark appearance for the map in the resulting snapshot image. When the value of this property is `nil` (the default), the snapshotter derives the appropriate appearance based on the following logic:

- If the user specifically disables Dark Mode for map content in the Maps app, the snapshot uses a light appearance.

- The snapshot uses your appâ€™s appearance.

- The snapshot uses the system appearance.
