## Discussion

The value of this property is dependent on whether you specify a departure date or arrival date in your MKDirections.Request object. If you specify a departure date, the framework computes the date in this property by starting at your departure date and adding the expected travel time. If you specify an arrival time, but not a departure date, the framework sets this property to your arrival time. If you donâ€™t specify an arrival date or departure date, the framework sets this property to the date that results by adding the travel time to the current time.
