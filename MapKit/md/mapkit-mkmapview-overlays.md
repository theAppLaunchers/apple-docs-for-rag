```

## Discussion

This property contains the union of all overlays at the different levels of the map. The objects in this array adopt the MKOverlay protocol. If the map view has no associated no overlays, the value of this property is an empty array.

The order of the objects in this array doesnâ€™t necessarily reflect their visual order on the map.
