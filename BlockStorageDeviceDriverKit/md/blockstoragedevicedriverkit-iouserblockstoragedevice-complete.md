Instance Method

# Complete

Indicates that the dext completed an asynchronous call.

DriverKit 21.0+

``` source
void Complete(uint32_t requestID, kern_return_t status);
```

## Parameters 

`requestID`  

An opaque identifier, originally provided in the corresponding `DoAsyncâ€¦` call.

`status`  

The status of the request.

## Discussion

The dext calls this method to indicate completion of an asynchronous call to methods like DoAsyncUnmap, DoAsyncSynchronize, or DoAsyncEjectMedia. Use the `requestID` parameter to determine which call resulted in this callback.
