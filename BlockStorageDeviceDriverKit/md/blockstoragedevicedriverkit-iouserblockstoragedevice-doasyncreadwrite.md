Instance Method

# DoAsyncReadWrite

Starts an asynchronous read or write operation.

DriverKit 21.0+

``` source
kern_return_t DoAsyncReadWrite(bool isRead, uint32_t requestID, uint64_t dmaAddr, uint64_t size, uint64_t lba, uint64_t numOfBlocks, IOUserStorageOptions options);
```

## Parameters 

`requestID`  

An opaque identifier. After the dext completes the request, it calls CompleteIO and sends this value as a parameter.

`dmaAddr`  

The DMA address of the data buffer.

`size`  

The size of the data buffer.

`lba`  

The start logical block number.

`numOfBlocks`  

The number of blocks to read or write.

`options`  

Data transfer options. These can be any combination of `kIOUserStorageâ€¦` values (defined in IOUserStorageOptions) combined together with the logical `OR` operator.

## Return Value

A value that indicates the result of the read/write operation. kIOReturnSuccess indicates success. For error definitions, see IOKit Constants.

## Discussion

When the read or write operation completes, the dext calls your CompleteIO method with the results of the operation.
