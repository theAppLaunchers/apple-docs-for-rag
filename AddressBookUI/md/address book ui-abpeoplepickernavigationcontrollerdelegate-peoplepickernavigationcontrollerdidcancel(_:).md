``` source
optional func peoplePickerNavigationControllerDidCancel(_ peoplePicker: ABPeoplePickerNavigationController)
```

## Parameters 

`peoplePicker`  

The people-picker navigation controller with which the user interacted.

## Discussion

If the delegate does not implement this method, the people picker will dismiss itself when the user taps cancel.

### Special Considerations

Prior to iOS 8, the delegate was responsible for dismissing the people picker and this method was required.
