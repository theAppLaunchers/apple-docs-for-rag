Instance Method

# getSupportedTimeTravelDirections(for:withHandler:)

Determines whether your complication can provide timeline entries for the future or the past.

watchOS 2.0â€“7.0Deprecated

``` source
@MainActor
optional func getSupportedTimeTravelDirections(
    for complication: CLKComplication,
    withHandler handler: @escaping (CLKComplicationTimeTravelDirections) -> Void
)
```

Deprecated

Time Travel is no longer supported. Use CLKComplicationDataSource's getTimelineEndDateForComplication:withHandler: to specify forward timeline support.

## Parameters 

`complication`  

The complication tied to the request.

`handler`  

The handler to execute with the Time Travel directions. This block has no return value and takes the following parameter:

directions  
The supported time travel directions. You may combine the values of the CLKComplicationTimeTravelDirections type when specifying this value.

Loading future timeline events

## Discussion

The system calls this method to determine whether your app can provide future or past data entries for the specified complication type. Your implementation of this method must execute the block in the `handler` parameter and specify the supported directions.

Include the backward constant if your app provides a historical record of events that have occurred or information that was valid at specific times. For example, a music app could provide entries for songs that have already played.

Include the forward constant if your app is able to generate complication data tied to future dates. For example, a calendar app would provide entries for future meeting times.

In watchOS 7 and later, the system checks the value returned by getTimelineEndDate(for:withHandler:) instead. If the method returns a non-nil value, ClockKit attempts to bulk load future timeline entries. Otherwise, it only asks for the current timeline entry.
