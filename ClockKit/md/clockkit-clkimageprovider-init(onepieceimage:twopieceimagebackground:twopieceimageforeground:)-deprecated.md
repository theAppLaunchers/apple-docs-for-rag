## Parameters 

`onePieceImage`  

The one-piece image to use. The image must be a template image, where only the alpha channel is used to define the image contents. This parameter must not be `nil`.

`twoPieceImageBackground`  

The background to use for a two-piece image. The image must be a template image, where only the alpha channel is used to define the image contents. This parameter must not be `nil`.

`twoPieceImageForeground`  

The foreground to use for a two-piece image. The image must be a template image, where only the alpha channel is used to define the image contents. This parameter must not be `nil`.

## Return Value

An image provider with both the one-piece and two-piece images.

## Discussion

Use this method when you want to display a two-piece image in multicolor environments. In monochrome environments, the image provider still displays the one-piece image. After creating the image provider, you can customize the tint color applied to your images by modifying the tintColor property.
