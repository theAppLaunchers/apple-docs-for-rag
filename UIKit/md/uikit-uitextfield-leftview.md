## Discussion

You can use the left overlay view to indicate the intended behavior of the text field. For example, you might display a magnifying glass in this location to indicate that the text field is a search field. The left overlay view flips automatically in a right-to-left user interface.

The left overlay view is placed in the rectangle returned by the leftViewRect(forBounds:) method of the receiver. The image associated with this property should fit the given rectangle. If it does not fit, it is scaled to fit. If you specify a control for your view, the control tracks and sends actions as usual.
