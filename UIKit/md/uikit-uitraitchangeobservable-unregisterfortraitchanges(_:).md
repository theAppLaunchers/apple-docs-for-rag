Instance Method

# unregisterForTraitChanges(\_:)

Tells the system to stop observing previously registered traits.

iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac CatalysttvOS 17.0+visionOS

``` source
@MainActor
func unregisterForTraitChanges(_ registration: any UITraitChangeRegistration)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`registration`  

A token that identifies the registration, obtained from one of the trait registration method calls.

## Discussion

Use this method if you want the system to stop observing trait changes for a previous registration. UIKit doesnâ€™t require you to unregister for trait changes at the end of the view lifecycle. Unregister only if you need to dynamically change which traits you observe.
