## Discussion

You can use this property to specify the types of data (phone numbers, `http` links, and so on) that should be automatically converted to URLs in the text view. When tapped, the text view opens the application responsible for handling the URL type and passes it the URL. Note that data detection does not occur if the text viewâ€™s isEditable property is set to true.
