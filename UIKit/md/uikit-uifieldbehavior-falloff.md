Instance Property

# falloff

The rate of decay for the field strength.

``` source
@MainActor
var falloff: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property defines how quickly the field strength diminishes as the distance from the fieldâ€™s center increases. Falloff is not applied until the distance between objects is greater than the value in the minimumRadius property.

The default value of the property is 0, which yields a uniform field that does not diminish over distance.
