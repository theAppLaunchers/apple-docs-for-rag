## Discussion

By setting the userActivity property on a responder, the NSUserActivity object becomes managed by UIKit. User activities managed by UIKit are saved automatically at appropriate times. You can lazily add state data representing the userâ€™s activity using the updateUserActivityState(_:) override. Multiple responders can share a single NSUserActivity instance, in which case they all get an updateUserActivityState(_:) callback.

Note

Prior to invoking updateUserActivityState(_:) on all of the associated objects, the `userInfo` dictionary for the NSUserActivity object is cleared.

A responder object can set its userActivity property to `nil` if it no longer wants to participate. Any NSUserActivity objects that are managed by UIKit but which have no associated responders (or documents) are automatically invalidated.
