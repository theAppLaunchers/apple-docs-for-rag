## Mentioned in 

Handling pinch gestures

## Overview

UIPinchGestureRecognizer is a concrete subclass of UIGestureRecognizer.

The user must press two fingers on a view while pinching it. When the user moves the two fingers toward each other, the conventional meaning is zoom out; when the user moves the two fingers away from each other, the conventional meaning is zoom in.

Pinching is a continuous gesture. The gesture begins (UIGestureRecognizer.State.began) when the user moves the two fingers enough to create a pinch gesture. The gesture changes (UIGestureRecognizer.State.changed) when a finger moves (while both fingers remain touching). The gesture ends (UIGestureRecognizer.State.ended) when the user lifts both fingers from the view.

## Topics

### Interpreting the pinching gesture

var scale: CGFloat

The scale factor relative to the points of the two touches in screen coordinates.

var velocity: CGFloat

The velocity of the pinch in scale factor per second.
