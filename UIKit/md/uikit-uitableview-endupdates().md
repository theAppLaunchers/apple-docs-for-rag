## Discussion

Use the performBatchUpdates(_:completion:) method instead of this one whenever possible.

You call this method to bracket a series of method calls that begins with beginUpdates() and that consists of operations to insert, delete, select, and reload rows and sections of the table view. When you call `endUpdates`, `UITableView` animates the operations simultaneously. Invocations of beginUpdates() and `endUpdates` can be nested. If you donâ€™t make the insertion, deletion, and selection calls inside this block, table attributes such as row count can become invalid.
