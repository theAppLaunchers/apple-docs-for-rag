## Discussion

The miter limit helps you avoid spikes in paths that use the CGLineJoin.miter join style. If the ratio of the miter lengthâ€”that is, the diagonal length of the miter joinâ€”to the line thickness exceeds the miter limit, the joint is converted to a bevel join. The default miter limit is 10, which results in the conversion of miters whose angle at the joint is less than 11 degrees.
