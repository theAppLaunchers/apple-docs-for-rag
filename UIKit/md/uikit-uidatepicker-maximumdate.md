## Discussion

Use this property to configure the maximum date thatâ€™s selected in the date picker interface. The property contains an NSDate object or `nil` (the default), which means no maximum date. This property, along with the minimumDate property, lets you specify a valid date range. If the minimum date value is greater than the maximum date value, both properties are ignored. The minimum and maximum dates are also ignored in the countdown-timer mode (UIDatePicker.Mode.countDownTimer).
