# UIUpdateActionPhase

An object that defines specific phases of the UI update process.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+tvOS 18.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
@MainActor
class UIUpdateActionPhase
```

## Overview

Each UI update consists of several phases that run in a consistent order, and the UIUpdateActionPhase object defines constants that represent these phases. When using a UIUpdateLink, you can use these constants to decide which phase of the UI update process you want its actions to run in.

There are two *phase groups*: standard and low-latency. The standard phase group runs for each UI update. This phase group includes these phases, which run in the following order:

1.  beforeEventDispatch

2.  afterEventDispatch

3.  beforeCADisplayLinkDispatch

4.  afterCADisplayLinkDispatch

5.  beforeCATransactionCommit

6.  afterCATransactionCommit

The low-latency phase group is optional, and itâ€™s off by default. It runs only if you explicitly request low-latency event dispatch using wantsLowLatencyEventDispatch. The low-latency phase group includes these phases, which run in the following order (after the standard phases):

1.  beforeLowLatencyEventDispatch

2.  afterLowLatencyEventDispatch

3.  beforeLowLatencyCATransactionCommit

4.  afterLowLatencyCATransactionCommit

When a phase group runs, all phases inside the group run. Phases run one after another in the specified order without exiting back into the run loop.
