## Discussion

Use this style for apps that support viewing or editing of individual documents, like text editors. With this style, the navigation itemâ€™s title appears on the leading side of the navigation bar, and center items (centerItemGroups) appear in the center of the bar. The back button appears as a chevron without a title or image.
