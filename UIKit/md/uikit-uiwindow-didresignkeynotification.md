## Discussion

The notification object is the window that resigned its main window status. This notification doesnâ€™t contain a `userInfo` dictionary.

The system posts this notification on the main actor. In iOS 15 and later, the system posts this notification when the window is no longer the key window of its scene. In iOS 14 and earlier, the system posts this notification when the window is no longer the key window of the app.
