Instance Property

# savingFileType

Returns the file type to use for saving a document.

@MainActor
var savingFileType: String? { get }
```

## Return Value

A Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) identifying a document type (for example, PDF or HTML).

## Discussion

The default implementation returns the current file type obtained from the fileType property. The default implementation of the save(to:for:completionHandler:) method appends an extension to the file URL thatâ€™s based on the file type. So if you want to move the document to a new type and extension, you can override this method to supply that file type.
