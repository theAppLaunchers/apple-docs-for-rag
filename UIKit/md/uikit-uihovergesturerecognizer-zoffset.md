Instance Property

# zOffset

A value that represents the normalized distance between the screen and a hovering pointing device, such as Apple Pencil.

iOS 16.1+iPadOS 16.1+Mac Catalyst 16.1+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
@MainActor
var zOffset: CGFloat { get }
```

## Discussion

This value is `1` at the maximum distance from the screen and approaches `0` as the pointing device gets closer to the screen. This value is `0` for devices that donâ€™t support zOffset.

For example, a drawing app might use the value of this property to generate a preview that indicates where a hovering Apple Pencil touches down on an iPad screen. For more information, see Adopting hover support for Apple Pencil.
