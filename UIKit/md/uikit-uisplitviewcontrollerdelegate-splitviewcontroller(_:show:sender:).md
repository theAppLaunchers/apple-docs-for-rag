    sender: Any?
) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`splitViewController`  

The split view controller whose primary view controller is being updated.

`vc`  

The view controller being displayed in the primary position.

`sender`  

The object that made the request.

## Return Value

true if you handled the presentation of the view controller, or false if you want the split view controller to do it.

## Discussion

This delegate method only applies to classic split view interfaces. For more information, see Split view styles.

When its show(_:sender:) method is called, the split view controller calls this method to see if your delegate will handle the presentation of the specified view controller. If you implement this method and your implementation returns true, you are responsible for presenting the specified view controller in the primary position of the split view interface. The split view controller does nothing more to try to show the view controller.

If you donâ€™t implement this method or if your implementation returns false, the split view controller presents the view controller.
