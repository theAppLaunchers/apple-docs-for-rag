# UIDropOperation.copy

A drop operation type specifying that the data represented by the drag items should be copied to the destination view.

``` source
case copy
```

## Discussion

This operation is used most often. When the user performs a drop activity, the dropInteraction(_:performDrop:) delegate method is called. Your implementation of this delegate method should copy the data from the drag items to the destination view.
