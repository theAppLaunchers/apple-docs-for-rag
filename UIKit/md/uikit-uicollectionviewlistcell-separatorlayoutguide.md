## Discussion

This property only takes effect in a layout section that supports separators, like a section that you create using list(using:layoutEnvironment:).

The separator layout guide represents the frame of the separator, which the system uses to determine where to draw the separator at the bottom of the cell.

By default, when you apply a system-provided content configuration to a list cell, the separator automatically aligns to the primary text in the content view. For custom subviews in the cell, you need to add a constraint to this layout guide that connects it to the leading edge of the cellâ€™s primary content.

To align the separators to your content, add constraints to the leading or trailing anchors of this layout guide.
