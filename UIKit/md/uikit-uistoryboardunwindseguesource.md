``` source

class UIStoryboardUnwindSegueSource
```

## Overview

You donâ€™t create instances of this class yourself. UIKit creates an unwind segue source object in response to the triggering of an unwind segue. It passes the source object to other view controller methods that determine the destination of the unwind segue. The information in an unwind segue source object includes the view controller being dismissed by the segue and the action method responsible for the dismissal.

## Topics

### Getting the unwind segue attributes
