func setNeedsDropPreviewUpdate()
```

## Discussion

Call this method to provide an updated drop preview after UIKit has started the drop animation. If the drop animation is still ongoing, UIKit calls the drop interaction delegateâ€™s dropInteraction(_:previewForDropping:withDefault:) method, passing the previous drop preview as the `defaultPreview`.
