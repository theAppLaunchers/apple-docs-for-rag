Instance Method

# touchesCancelled(\_:with:)

Sent to the gesture recognizer when a system event (such as an incoming phone call) cancels a touch event.

``` source
@MainActor
func touchesCancelled(
    _ touches: Set,
    with event: UIEvent
)
```

## Parameters 

`touches`  

A set of UITouch instances in the event represented by `event` that represent the touches in the UITouch.Phase.cancelled phase.

`event`  

A UIEvent object representing the event to which the touches belong.

## Discussion

This method has the same exact signature as the corresponding one declared by UIResponder. Through this method a gesture recognizer receives touch objects (in their UITouch.Phase.cancelled phase) before the view attached to the gesture recognizer receives them. `UIGestureRecognizer` objects are not in the responder chain, yet observe touches hit-tested to their view and their viewâ€™s subviews. After observation, the delivery of touch objects to the attached view, or their disposition otherwise, is affected by the cancelsTouchesInView, delaysTouchesBegan, and delaysTouchesEnded properties.

Upon receiving this message, the gesture recognizer for a continuous gesture should set its state to UIGestureRecognizer.State.cancelled; a gesture recognizer for a discrete gesture should set its state to UIGestureRecognizer.State.failed.

func touchesEnded(Set&lt;UITouch>, with: UIEvent)

Sent to the gesture recognizer when one or more fingers lift from the associated view.

func touchesEstimatedPropertiesUpdated(Set&lt;UITouch>)

Sent to the gesture recognizer when the estimated properties for a touch have changed so that they are no longer estimated, or an update is no longer expected.

func reset()

Overridden to reset internal state when a gesture recognition attempt completes.

func ignore(UITouch, for: UIEvent)

Tells the gesture recognizer to ignore a specific touch of the given event.

func canBePrevented(by: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool

Overridden to indicate that the specified gesture recognizer can prevent the receiver from recognizing a gesture.

func canPrevent(UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool

Overridden to indicate that the receiver can prevent the specified gesture recognizer from recognizing its gesture.

func shouldReceive(UIEvent) -> Bool

func shouldRequireFailure(of: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool

Overridden to indicate that the receiver requires the specified gesture recognizer to fail.

func shouldBeRequiredToFail(by: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool

Overridden to indicate that the receiver should be required to fail by the specified gesture recognizer.

func ignore(UIPress, for: UIPressesEvent)

Tells the gesture recognizer to ignore a specific press of the given event.

func pressesBegan(Set&lt;UIPress>, with: UIPressesEvent)

Sent to the receiver when a physical button is pressed in the associated view.

func pressesChanged(Set&lt;UIPress>, with: UIPressesEvent)

Sent to the receiver when the force of the press has changed in the associated view.

func pressesEnded(Set&lt;UIPress>, with: UIPressesEvent)

Sent to the receiver when a button is released from the associated view.
