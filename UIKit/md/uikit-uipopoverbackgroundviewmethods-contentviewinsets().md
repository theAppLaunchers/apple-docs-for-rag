## Discussion

Consider your popover background view without the arrow, and the insets in this property represent the distance from a given edge of your background content to the corresponding edge of the popoverâ€™s content view. (This edges of the background content should be flush with the frame rectangle of your view, except on the side containing the arrow, of course.) The popover controller uses these values (in combination with the value returned by the arrowHeight() method) to determine where to position the popover content view. Because the arrow height is accounted for separately, your implementation of this method should return a set of constant values.
