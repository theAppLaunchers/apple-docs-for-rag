## Discussion

If an invitation to share CloudKit data is available at scene-connection time, this property contains the metadata you use to accept that invitation. Use the information in the object to create and schedule a CKAcceptSharesOperation object. After your operation object finishes successfully, you can begin fetching records and incorporating the resulting data into your app.
