## Discussion

UIKit calls this method before adjusting the layout of the views in the container view. Use this method and the containerViewDidLayoutSubviews() method to update any custom views managed by your presentation controller.

In iOS 18 and later, UIKit supports automatic trait tracking inside this method for traits from this presentation controllerâ€™s `traitCollection` and the `traitCollection` of its containerView. For more information, see Automatic trait tracking.
