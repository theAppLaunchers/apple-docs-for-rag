## Discussion

When the tab bar is translucent, configure the edgesForExtendedLayout and extendedLayoutIncludesOpaqueBars properties of your view controller to display your content underneath the tab bar.

If the tab bar doesnâ€™t have a custom background image, or if any pixel of the background image has an alpha value of less than `1.0`, the default value of this property is true. If the background image is completely opaque, the default value of this property is false. If you set this property to true and the custom background image is completely opaque, UIKit applies a system-defined opacity of less than `1.0` to the image. If you set this property to false and the background image is not opaque, UIKit adds an opaque backdrop.
