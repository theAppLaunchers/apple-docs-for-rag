Handling row selection in a table view

## Discussion

The default value of this property is false. If you set it to true, check marks appear next to selected rows in editing mode. In addition, UITableView doesnâ€™t query for editing styles when it goes into editing mode. If you access indexPathsForSelectedRows, you can get the index paths that identify the selected rows.
