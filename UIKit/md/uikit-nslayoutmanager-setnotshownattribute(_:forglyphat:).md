Instance Method

Sets the visibility of the glyph at the specified index.

iOS 7.0+iPadOS 7.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+

``` source
func setNotShownAttribute(
    _ flag: Bool,
    forGlyphAt glyphIndex: Int
)
```

## Parameters 

`flag`  

If true, the glyph is not shown; if false, it is shown.

`glyphIndex`  

Index of the glyph whose attribute is set.

## Discussion

The typesetter decides which glyphs are not shown and sets this attribute in the layout manager to ensure that those glyphs are not displayed. For example, a tab or newline character doesnâ€™t leave any marks; it just indicates where following glyphs are laid out.

Raises an `NSRangeException` if `glyphIndex` is out of bounds.

This method is used by the layout mechanism and should be invoked only during typesetting, in almost all cases only by the typesetter. For example, a custom typesetter might invoke it.
