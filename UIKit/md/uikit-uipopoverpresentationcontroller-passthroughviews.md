``` source

var passthroughViews: [UIView]? { get set }
```

## Discussion

When a popover is active, interactions with other views are normally disabled until the popover is dismissed. Assigning an array of UIView objects to this property causes UIKit to continue dispatching touch event to the views you specified.
