Protocol

# UIAdaptivePresentationControllerDelegate

A set of methods that, in conjunction with a presentation controller, determine how to respond to trait changes in your app.

``` source
@MainActor
protocol UIAdaptivePresentationControllerDelegate : NSObjectProtocol
```

## Overview

After implementing an object that conforms to this protocol, assign that object to the delegate property of an appropriate UIPresentationController object. Your delegate can suggest a new presentation style or an entirely new view controller for displaying content. For more information about using the delegate to respond to size class changes, see UIPresentationController.

## Topics

### Adapting the presentation style

func adaptivePresentationStyle(for: UIPresentationController, traitCollection: UITraitCollection) -> UIModalPresentationStyle

Asks the delegate for the presentation style to use when the specified set of traits are active.

func adaptivePresentationStyle(for: UIPresentationController) -> UIModalPresentationStyle

Asks the delegate for the new presentation style to use.

### Adapting the view controller

func presentationController(UIPresentationController, viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle: UIModalPresentationStyle) -> UIViewController?

Asks the delegate for the view controller to display when adapting to the specified presentation style.

### Responding to adaptive transitions

func presentationController(UIPresentationController, willPresentWithAdaptiveStyle: UIModalPresentationStyle, transitionCoordinator: (any UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator)?)

Notifies the delegate that an adaptivity-related transition is about to occur.

func presentationControllerDidAttemptToDismiss(UIPresentationController)

Notifies the delegate that a user-initiated attempt to dismiss a view was prevented.

func presentationControllerShouldDismiss(UIPresentationController) -> Bool

Asks the delegate for permission to dismiss the presentation.

func presentationControllerDidDismiss(UIPresentationController)

Notifies the delegate after a presentation is dismissed.

func presentationControllerWillDismiss(UIPresentationController)

Notifies the delegate before a presentation is dismissed.

### Preparing the adaptive presentation controller

func presentationController(UIPresentationController, prepare: UIPresentationController)

Provides an opportunity to configure the adaptive presentation controller after an adaptivity change.
