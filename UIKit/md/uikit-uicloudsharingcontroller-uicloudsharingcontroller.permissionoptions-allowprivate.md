## Discussion

To give the user the option to limit access to people who have been invited, include the allowPrivate option when setting the availablePermissions property on the UICloudSharingController instance.

Note

When inviting someone, the user must provide that personâ€™s email address or phone number. This is how the person is identified when accepting the invitation.
