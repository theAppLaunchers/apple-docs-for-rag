Instance Method

# instantiateViewController(identifier:creator:)

Creates the specified view controller from the storyboard and initializes it using your custom initialization code.

iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac CatalysttvOS 13.0+visionOS

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
func instantiateViewController(
    identifier: String,
    creator: ((NSCoder) -> ViewController?)? = nil
) -> ViewController where ViewController : UIViewController
```

## Parameters 

`identifier`  

A string that uniquely identifies the view controller in the storyboard file. At design time, put this same string in the Storyboard ID attribute of your view controller in Interface Builder. This identifier is not a property of the view controller object itself. The storyboard uses it to locate the appropriate data for your view controller.

If the specified identifier does not exist in the storyboard file, this method raises an exception.

`creator`  

A block containing your custom creation code for the view controller. Use this block to create the view controller, initialize it with the provided `coder` object and any custom information you require, and return the result. This block returns a new view controller object and takes the following parameter:

coder  
The coder object containing the storyboard data to use when configuring the view controller.

If you return `nil` from your block, this method creates the view controller using the default init(coder:) method.

## Return Value

The view controller corresponding to the specified identifier string. If no view controller has the given identifier, this method throws an exception.

## Discussion

Use this method to create a view controller object to present programmatically. Each time you call this method, it creates a new instance of the view controller using the block you provide.

In your block, create the view controller using your custom initialization method and return it. Your custom initialization method must accept an NSCoder parameter and must call the inherited init(coder:) method at some point during its execution. Not doing so is a programmer error. After initializing the storyboard state, initialize your view controllerâ€™s custom properties.
