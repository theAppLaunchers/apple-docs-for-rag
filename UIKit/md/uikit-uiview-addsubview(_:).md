``` source
@MainActor
func addSubview(_ view: UIView)
```

## Parameters 

`view`  

The view to be added. After being added, this view appears on top of any other subviews.

## Discussion

This method establishes a strong reference to `view` and sets its next responder to the receiver, which is its new superview.

Views can have only one superview. If `view` already has a superview and that view is not the receiver, this method removes the previous superview before making the receiver its new superview.
