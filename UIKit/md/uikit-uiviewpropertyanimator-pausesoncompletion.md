## Discussion

When the value of this property is true, the animator remains in the UIViewAnimatingState.active state when the animation finishes, and it does not execute its completion handler. Keeping the animator in the UIViewAnimatingState.active state allows you to reverse the animation even after it has finished. When the value of this property is false, the animator automatically transitions to the UIViewAnimatingState.inactive state when the animation finishes, thereby concluding the animation. The default value of this property is false.

Because the completion handler is not called when this property is true, you cannot use the animatorâ€™s completion handler to determine when the animations have finished running. Instead, you determine when the animation has ended by observing the isRunning property.
