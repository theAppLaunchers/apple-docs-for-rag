```

## Discussion

When this property is set to true, the system tries to reduce the space between characters before truncating characters. The system performs this tightening in cases where the text would not otherwise fit in the available space. The maximum amount of tightening performed by the system is dependent on the font, line width, and other factors.

The default value of this property is false.
