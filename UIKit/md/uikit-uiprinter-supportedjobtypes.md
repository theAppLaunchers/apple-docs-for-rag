## Discussion

Job types indicate the types of operations you can perform with the printer. You might use this information when deciding whether or not to use a printer for a particular task. For example, a photo app might prevent a printer picker interface from displaying printers that do not support the photo job type.

For printers you create yourself using the init(url:) method, the value of this property is unknown until you successfully connect to the printer using the contactPrinter(_:) method.
