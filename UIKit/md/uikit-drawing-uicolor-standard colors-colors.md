# Standard colors

Define standard color objects for specific shades, such as red, blue, green, black, white, and more.

## Overview

Use the standard color objects when you want to use a specific color shade in your UI. To view swatches of these colors, see System Colors.

The system color objects adapt automatically to Dark Mode changes when you use the provided UIColor object, but the fixed-shade colors donâ€™t adapt. If you retrieve the color values, either directly or using another type such as CGColor, you must handle Dark Mode changes yourself. For more information about supporting Dark Mode, see Supporting Dark Mode in Your Interface.
