## Discussion

This property is typically used to provide a view to replace the system-supplied keyboard thatâ€™s presented for UITextField and UITextView objects.

The value of this read-only property is `nil`. A responder object that requires a custom view to gather input from the user should redeclare this property as read-write and use it to manage its custom input view. When the responder becomes the first responder, the responder infrastructure presents the specified input view automatically. Similarly, when the responder resigns its first responder status, the responder infrastructure automatically dismisses the specified input view.
