## Discussion

This property is typically used to attach an accessory view controller to the system-supplied keyboard thatâ€™s presented for UITextField and UITextView objects.

The value of this read-only property is `nil`. If you want to attach custom controls to a system-supplied input view controller (such as the system keyboard) or to a custom input view (one you provide in the inputViewController property), redeclare this property as read-write in a UIResponder subclass. You can then use this property to manage a custom accessory view. When the responder becomes the first responder, the responder infrastructure attaches the accessory view to the appropriate input view before displaying it.
