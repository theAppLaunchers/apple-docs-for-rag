Configuring the cells for your table

## Discussion

Use this property to specify a custom height for the cells in your table view. The default value of this property is automaticDimension, which causes the table view to choose an appropriate height based on your cellâ€™s content.

If you create a self-sizing cell in Interface Builder, the table view changes the default row height to the value you set in Interface Builder. To get the expected self-sizing behavior for a cell that you create in Interface Builder, you must explicitly set rowHeight to automaticDimension in your code.

The table view ignores the value of this property if its delegate implements the tableView(_:heightForRowAt:) method. Prefer the use of this property over the delegate method when specifying row heights. When you implement the delegate method, the table view must call that method for every row of the table, including those that are offscreen. For tables with large numbers of rows (1000 or more), calling that method many times can negatively impact performance.
