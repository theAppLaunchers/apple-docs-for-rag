## Discussion

Enable proximity monitoring only when your application needs to be notified of changes to the proximity state. Otherwise, disable proximity monitoring. The default value is false.

Not all iOS devices have proximity sensors. To determine if proximity monitoring is available, attempt to enable it. If the value of the isProximityMonitoringEnabled property remains false, proximity monitoring isnâ€™t available.
