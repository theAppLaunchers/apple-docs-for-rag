Instance Method

# updateChangeCount(\_:)

Updates the change counter by indicating the kind of change.

iOS 5.0+iPadOS 5.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
@MainActor
func updateChangeCount(_ change: UIDocument.ChangeKind)
```

## Parameters 

`change`  

A constant that indicates whether a change has been made, cleared, undone, or redone. See UIDocument.ChangeKind for more information.

## Discussion

Calling this method can affect the value returned by hasUnsavedChanges. You shouldnâ€™t need to call method this if you access an UndoManager object from the undoManager property (or assign a custom one to it) and register changes with the undo manager.
