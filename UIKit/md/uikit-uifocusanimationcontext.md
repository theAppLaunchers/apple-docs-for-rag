``` source
@MainActor
protocol UIFocusAnimationContext : NSObjectProtocol
```

## Overview

You donâ€™t adopt this protocol in your custom classes. When a focus update occurs and the system provides you with a UIFocusAnimationCoordinator object, you can use that object to specify custom focus-related animations. When the time comes for the system to execute your animations, it delivers an object that adopts this protocol to your animation block. The context object contains information about the system animations that you can use to configure the behavior of your own animations. For example, you might configure your animations to be exactly half the duration of the system animations.
