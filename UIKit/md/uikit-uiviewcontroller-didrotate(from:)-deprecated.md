Instance Method

# didRotate(from:)

Sent to the view controller after the user interface rotates.

iOS 2.0–8.0DeprecatediPadOS 2.0–8.0DeprecatedMac Catalyst 13.1–13.1Deprecated

``` source
@MainActor
func didRotate(from fromInterfaceOrientation: UIInterfaceOrientation)
```

Deprecated

Use viewWillTransition(to:with:) to make interface-based adjustments.

## Parameters 

`fromInterfaceOrientation`  

The old orientation of the user interface. For possible values, see UIInterfaceOrientation.

## Discussion

Subclasses may override this method to perform additional actions immediately after the rotation. For example, you might use this method to reenable view interactions, start media playback again, or turn on expensive drawing or live updates. By the time this method is called, the interfaceOrientation property is already set to the new orientation. Your implementation of this method must call `super` at some point during its execution.

This method is called regardless of whether your code performs one-step or two-step rotations.
