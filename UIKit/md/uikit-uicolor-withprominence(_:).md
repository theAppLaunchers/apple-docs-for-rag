## Return Value

## Discussion

Interface elements, such as text labels, can have a different level of prominence in the UI. For example, a title label appears more prominently than a subtitle or caption. When you specify a labelâ€™s color, you can pass one of the UIColor.Prominence constants to withProminence(_:) to communicate how prominently to display that color in the UI.

The following code creates a label with a secondary, vibrant red color:

```
let label = UILabel()
label.preferredVibrancy = .automatic
label.textColor = .systemRed.withProminence(.secondary) 
```
