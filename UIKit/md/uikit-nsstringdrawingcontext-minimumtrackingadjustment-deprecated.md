## Discussion

Changing the value of this property tells the renderer that it can change the tracking to a value no smaller than the indicated amount. For example, a value of `-0.5` indicates that characters can be tracked closer together by up to half a point. A value of 0 indicates that the standard spacing is used. A typical range of values for this property would be `-0.5` to `0.0`. The default value of this property is `0.0`.
