``` source
@MainActor
func completeTransition(_ didComplete: Bool)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`didComplete`  

true if the transition to the presented view controller completed successfully or false if the original view controller is still being displayed.

## Discussion

You must call this method after your animations have completed to notify the system that the transition animation is done. The parameter you pass must indicate whether the animations completed successfully. For interactive animations, you must call this method in addition to the finishInteractiveTransition() or cancelInteractiveTransition() method. The best place to call this method is in the completion block of your animations.

The default implementation of this method calls the animator objectâ€™s animationEnded(_:) method to give it a chance to perform any last minute cleanup.
