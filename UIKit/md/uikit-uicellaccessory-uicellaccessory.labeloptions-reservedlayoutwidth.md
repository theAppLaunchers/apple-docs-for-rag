```

## Discussion

Use this property to ensure consistent horizontal alignment from both system and custom accessories to your content, even when the accessories vary in size.

The reserved layout width only affects the amount of space for the accessory, and its positioning within that space. It doesnâ€™t affect the size of the accessory.
