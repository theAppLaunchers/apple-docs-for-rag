Instance Method

# register(\_:forDecorationViewOfKind:)

Registers a class for use in creating decoration views for a collection view.

iOS 6.0+iPadOS 6.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+

``` source
@MainActor
func register(
    _ viewClass: AnyClass?,
    forDecorationViewOfKind elementKind: String
)
```

## Parameters 

`viewClass`  

The class to use for the supplementary view.

`elementKind`  

The element kind of the decoration view. You can use this string to distinguish between decoration views with different purposes in the layout. This parameter must not be `nil` and must not be an empty string.

## Discussion

This method gives the layout object a chance to register a decoration view for use in the collection view. Decoration views provide visual adornments to a section or to the entire collection view but are not otherwise tied to the data provided by the collection viewâ€™s data source.

You do not need to create decoration views explicitly. After registering one, it is up to the layout object to decide when a decoration view is needed and return the corresponding layout attributes from its layoutAttributesForElements(in:) method. For layout attributes that specify a decoration view, the collection view creates (or reuses) a view and displays it automatically based on the registered information.

If you previously registered a class or nib file with the same kind string, the class you specify in the `viewClass` parameter replaces the old entry. You may specify `nil` for `viewClass` if you want to unregister the decoration view.
