``` source
@MainActor
func animateTransition(using transitionContext: any UIViewControllerContextTransitioning)
```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`transitionContext`  

The context object containing information about the transition.

## Discussion

UIKit calls this method when presenting or dismissing a view controller. Use this method to configure the animations associated with your custom transition. You can use view-based animations or Core Animation to configure your animations.

All animations must take place in the view specified by the containerView property of `transitionContext`. Add the view being presented (or revealed if the transition involves dismissing a view controller) to the container viewâ€™s hierarchy and set up any animations you want to make that view move into position. If you want to draw to the screen directly without a view, use this method to configure a CADisplayLink object instead.

You can retrieve the view controllers involved in the transition from the viewController(forKey:) method of `transitionContext`. For more information about the information provided by the context object, see UIViewControllerContextTransitioning.
