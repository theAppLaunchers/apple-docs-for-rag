Instance Method

# reconfigureItems(withIdentifiers:)

Updates the data for the items you specify in the snapshot, preserving the existing cells for the items.

iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+tvOS 15.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
func reconfigureItems(withIdentifiers identifiers: [Any])
```

## Parameters 

`identifiers`  

An array of identifiers corresponding to the items to update data for in the snapshot.

## Discussion

To update the contents of existing (including prefetched) cells without replacing them with new cells, use this method instead of reloadItems(withIdentifiers:). For optimal performance, choose to reconfigure items instead of reloading items unless you have an explicit need to replace the existing cell with a new cell.

Your cell provider must dequeue the same type of cell for the provided index path, and must return the same existing cell for a given index path. Because this method reconfigures existing cells, the collection view or table view doesnâ€™t call `prepareForReuse` for each cell dequeued. If you need to return a different type of cell for an index path, use reloadItems(withIdentifiers:) instead.

If your cells are self-sizing, the collection view or table view resizes your cells after reconfiguring them.

Set the `animatingDifferences` parameter to tell the collection view or table view whether to animate any size or layout changes that are a result of reconfiguration when you apply the snapshot to your data source. To avoid animations when setting specific properties, use performWithoutAnimation(_:) in your cell configuration logic.

If your collection view or table view uses a diffable data source, use this method. If your collection view uses a custom implementation of `UICollectionViewDataSource`, use reconfigureItems(at:) instead. If your table view uses a custom implementation of `UITableViewDataSource`, use reconfigureRows(at:) instead.
