## Mentioned in 

Handling pan gestures

## Overview

The system uses screen edge gestures in some cases to initiate view controller transitions. You can use this class to replicate the same gesture behavior for your own actions.

After creating a screen edge pan gesture recognizer, assign an appropriate value to the edges property before attaching the gesture recognizer to your view. You use this property to specify the edges where the gesture can start. This gesture recognizer ignores any touches beyond the first touch.

## Topics

### Specifying the starting edges

var edges: UIRectEdge

The acceptable starting edges for the gesture.

struct UIRectEdge

Constants that specify the edges of a rectangle.
