## Discussion

To support dragging content from the collection view to a view in your app or another app, set this property value to true. To disable this behavior, set the value to false. The default value is true.

In iOS 14 and earlier, the default value is true for iPad and false for iPhone. Setting the value to true on iPhone enables dragging within your app only. Dragging content to other apps isnâ€™t possible on iPhone prior to iOS 15.
