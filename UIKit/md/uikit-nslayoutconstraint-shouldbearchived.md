## Discussion

When a view is archived, it archives some but not all constraints in its constraints array. The value of shouldBeArchived informs the view if a particular constraint should be archived by the view.

If a constraint is created at runtime in response to the state of the object, it isnâ€™t appropriate to archive the constraint. Instead you archive the state that gives rise to the constraint. The default value for this property is false.
