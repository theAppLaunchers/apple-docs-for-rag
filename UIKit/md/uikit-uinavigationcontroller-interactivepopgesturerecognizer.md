## Discussion

The navigation controller installs this gesture recognizer on its view and uses it to pop the topmost view controller off the navigation stack. You can use this property to retrieve the gesture recognizer and tie it to the behavior of other gesture recognizers in your user interface. When tying your gesture recognizers together, make sure they recognize their gestures simultaneously to ensure that your gesture recognizers are given a chance to handle the event.
