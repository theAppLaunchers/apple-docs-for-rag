``` source

## Discussion

The interaction object enters this state once at the beginning of each interaction, and subsequently transitions to the UIBandSelectionInteraction.State.selecting or UIBandSelectionInteraction.State.ended state. When in this state, perform any one-time tasks that you need to manage your appâ€™s state. For example, you might prepare your view to start the selection of items.
