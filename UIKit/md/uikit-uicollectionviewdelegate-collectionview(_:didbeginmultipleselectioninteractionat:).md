Tells the delegate when the user starts using a two-finger pan gesture to select multiple items in a collection view.

iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
@MainActor
optional func collectionView(
    _ collectionView: UICollectionView,
    didBeginMultipleSelectionInteractionAt indexPath: IndexPath
)
```

## Parameters 

`collectionView`  

The collection view calling this method.

`indexPath`  

The index path of the item that the user touched to start the two-finger pan gesture.

## Discussion

Your implementation of this method is a good place to indicate, in the appâ€™s user interface, that the user is selecting multiple items; for example, you could replace an Edit or Select button with a Done button.

```
func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didBeginMultipleSelectionInteractionAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    // Replace the Select button with Done, and put the 
    // collection view into editing mode.
    setEditing(true, animated: true)
}
```
