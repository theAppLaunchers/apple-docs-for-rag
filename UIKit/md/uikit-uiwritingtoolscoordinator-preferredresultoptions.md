## Mentioned in 

Adding Writing Tools support to a custom UIKit view

## Discussion

Writing Tools can create plain text or rich text, and it can format text using lists or tables as needed. If your view doesnâ€™t support specific types of content, specify the types you do support in this property. The default value of this property is `UIWritingToolsResultOptions/default`, which lets the system determine the type of content to generate.
