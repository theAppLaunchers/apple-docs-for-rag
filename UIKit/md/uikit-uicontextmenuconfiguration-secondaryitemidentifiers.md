## Discussion

When the context menu acts on multiple items, you can use this property to include the identifiers of the secondary items in the configuration. You donâ€™t need to set this property when you create a configuration that originates from a multiple-item interaction in a collection view, such as in collectionView(_:contextMenuConfigurationForItemsAt:point:).
