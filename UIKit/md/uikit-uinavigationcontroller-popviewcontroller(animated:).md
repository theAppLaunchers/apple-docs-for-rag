``` source
@MainActor
func popViewController(animated: Bool) -> UIViewController?
```

## Parameters 

`animated`  

Set this value to true to animate the transition. Pass false if you are setting up a navigation controller before its view is displayed.

## Return Value

The view controller that was popped from the stack.

## Discussion

This method removes the top view controller from the stack and makes the new top of the stack the active view controller. If the view controller at the top of the stack is the root view controller, this method does nothing. In other words, you cannot pop the last item on the stack.

In addition to displaying the view associated with the new view controller at the top of the stack, this method also updates the navigation bar and tool bar accordingly. For information on how the navigation bar is updated, see Updating the navigation bar.
