## Mentioned in 

Making a view into a drop destination

## Discussion

You can use this method only in the drop interaction delegateâ€™s implementation of the dropInteraction(_:performDrop:) method. This method is called after the user drops the items into the destination view.

The completion handler is called on the main queue. It provides an array of all objects created, in the same order that the drag items were added to the drag session.
