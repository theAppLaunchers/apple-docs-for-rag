## Discussion

You may include any number of bar button items in a group, but you should keep the total number of items relatively small because of space considerations. The items in a group are typically related to each other, but need not be. The array must contain at least one item.

Items can belong to only one group at a time. If you specify an item thatâ€™s already in a group, UIKit removes the item from its previous group before assigning it to the current group.
