@MainActor
protocol UIFocusDebuggerOutput : NSObjectProtocol
```

## Overview

Donâ€™t use this protocol directly in your code. When debugging your app from the `lldb` command line, the methods of UIFocusDebugger output their results to an object that adopts this protocol. The debugger takes the output and formats it for display.
