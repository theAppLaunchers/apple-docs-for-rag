var canCancelContentTouches: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

If the value of this property is true and a view in the content has begun tracking a finger touching it, and if the user drags the finger enough to initiate a scroll, the view receives a touchesCancelled(_:with:) message and the scroll view handles the touch as a scroll. If the value of this property is false, the scroll view doesnâ€™t scroll regardless of finger movement once the content view starts tracking.
