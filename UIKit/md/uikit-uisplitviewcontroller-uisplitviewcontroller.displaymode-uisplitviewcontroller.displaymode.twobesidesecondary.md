## Discussion

This display mode is only available for UISplitViewController.Style.tripleColumn interfaces.

This display mode shows both sidebars tiled next to the secondary view controller. The primary view controller is displayed on the side specified by primaryEdge, followed by the supplementary view controller, and finally the secondary view controller. The secondary view controllerâ€™s view is fully interactive.

This display mode is available for the UISplitViewController.SplitBehavior.tile split behavior.
