## Discussion

In focus-based navigation systems, a control enters this state when it receives the focus. A focused control changes its appearance to indicate that it has focus, and this appearance differs from the appearance of the control when itâ€™s highlighted or selected. Further interactions with the control can result in it also becoming highlighted or selected.
