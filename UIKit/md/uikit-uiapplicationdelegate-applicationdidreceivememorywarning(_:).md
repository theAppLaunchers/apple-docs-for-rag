## Mentioned in 

Responding to memory warnings

## Discussion

Your implementation of this method should free up as much memory as possible by purging cached data objects that can be recreated (or reloaded from disk) later. You use this method in conjunction with the didReceiveMemoryWarning() of the UIViewController class and the didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification notification to release memory throughout your app.

It is strongly recommended that you implement this method. If your app does not release enough memory during low-memory conditions, the system may terminate it outright.
