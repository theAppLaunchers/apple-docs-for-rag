## Discussion

The default value for this property is UIImage.ResizingMode.tile. However, UIImage will implement the resizing mode the fastest way possible while still retaining the desired visual appearance. This means that if the region to be resized is a 1-pixel region and this property is set to UIImage.ResizingMode.tile, the region will be stretched instead because the two are virtually indistinguishable for a region of that size and stretching is dramatically faster than tiling. To set the value of this property, you need to call either animatedResizableImageNamed(_:capInsets:resizingMode:duration:) or resizableImage(withCapInsets:resizingMode:) and specify the resizing mode using the `resizingMode` parameter. For a list of possible values for this property, see UIImage.ResizingMode.
