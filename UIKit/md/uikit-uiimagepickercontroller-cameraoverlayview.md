## Discussion

You can use an overlay view to present a custom view hierarchy on top of the default image picker interface. The image picker layers your custom overlay view on top of the other image picker views and positions it relative to the screen coordinates. If you have the default camera controls set to be visible, incorporate transparency into your view, or position it to avoid obscuring the underlying content.

You can access this property only when the source type of the image picker is set to UIImagePickerController.SourceType.camera. Attempting to access this property for other source types results in throwing an invalidArgumentException exception.
