## Overview

The constants in this enumeration are for use as values of the videoQuality property.

The video quality setting applies to transcoding as well as to recording. Specifically, if the video quality setting is lower than the video quality of an existing movie, displaying that movie in the picker results in transcoding the movie to the lower quality.
