## Mentioned in 

Supporting Drag and Drop in Collection Views

## Overview

You donâ€™t create instances of this class yourself. When a drop occurs in the collection view, UIKit creates an instance of this class and passes it to your collectionView(_:performDropWith:) method. Use the object to let the collection view know how you want to animate the dropped items into position.
