## Discussion

This method tells the generator that an impact has occurred. In response, the generator may play the appropriate haptics based on the UIImpactFeedbackGenerator.FeedbackStyle value passed to the generatorâ€™s init(style:) initializer.

For information on setting up a feedback generator, see the UIFeedbackGenerator class.
