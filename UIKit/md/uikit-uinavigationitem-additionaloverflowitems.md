## Discussion

When you assign a non-`nil` value to this property, the overflow menu button appears on the trailing edge of the navigation bar. This button appears regardless of whether you provide menu elements in the callback for the UIDeferredMenuElement.

The system presents any menu elements you return in the callback for UIDeferredMenuElement in the overflow menu. The system also populates the overflow menu with any items that canâ€™t fit in the navigation bar due to layout space constraints.
