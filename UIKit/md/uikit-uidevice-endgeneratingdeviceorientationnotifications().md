## Discussion

This method stops the posting of orientationDidChangeNotification notifications and notifies the system that it can power down the accelerometer hardware if it isnâ€™t in use elsewhere. You call this method after a previous call to the beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications() method.
