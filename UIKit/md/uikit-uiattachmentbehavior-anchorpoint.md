Instance Property

# anchorPoint

The anchor point for the attachment behavior, if any.

``` source
@MainActor
var anchorPoint: CGPoint { get set }
```

## Discussion

The anchor point is relative to the coordinate system for the behaviorâ€™s associated dynamic animator. For attachment types without an anchor point, the value in this property is CGPointZero. For more information about the coordinate system of the reference view, see UIDynamicAnimator.
