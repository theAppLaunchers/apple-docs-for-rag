## Discussion

This transform affects the live preview image only and does not affect your custom overlay view or the default image picker controls. You can use this property in conjunction with custom controls to implement your own electronic zoom behaviors.

You can access this property only when the source type of the image picker is set to UIImagePickerController.SourceType.camera. Attempting to access this property for other source types results in the throwing of an invalidArgumentException exception.
