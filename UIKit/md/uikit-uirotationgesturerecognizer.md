## Mentioned in 

Handling rotation gestures

## Overview

UIRotationGestureRecognizer is a concrete subclass of UIGestureRecognizer.

The user must press two fingers on a view while rotating it. When the user moves the fingers opposite each other in a circular motion, the underlying view rotates in a corresponding direction and speed.

Rotation is a continuous gesture. It begins when the user moves the two fingers enough to create a rotation gesture. The gesture changes when a finger moves while both fingers remain touching. It ends when the user lifts both fingers. At each stage in the gesture, the gesture recognizer sends its action message.

## Topics

### Interpreting the gesture

var rotation: CGFloat

The rotation of the gesture in radians.

var velocity: CGFloat

The velocity of the rotation gesture in radians per second.
