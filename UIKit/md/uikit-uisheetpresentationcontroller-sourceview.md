## Discussion

The default value is `nil`, which means the system centers edge-attached sheets on the edge they attach to, and centers floating sheets vertically and horizontally in the window.

To customize the sheetâ€™s position, set a view within the view hierarchy of the presenting view controller as the sourceView of the sheet. The sheet attempts to visually center itself over this view. The system only positions the sheet within system-defined margins.
