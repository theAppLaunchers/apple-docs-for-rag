## Discussion

This method is automatically invoked in response to an edited(_:range:changeInLength:) message or an endEditing() message if edits were made within the scope of a beginEditing() block. You should never need to invoke it directly.

This method begins by posting an willProcessEditingNotification to the default notification center (which results in the delegate receiving a textStorage(_:willProcessEditing:range:changeInLength:) message). Then it fixes attributes. After this, it posts an didProcessEditingNotification to the default notification center (which results in the delegate receiving a textStorage(_:didProcessEditing:range:changeInLength:) message). Finally, it sends a textStorage(_:edited:range:changeInLength:invalidatedRange:) message to each of the receiverâ€™s layout managers using the argument values provided.
