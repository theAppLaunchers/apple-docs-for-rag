# imageReservation

A value that reserves space for the image in the same axis as the edge against which the button places the image.

``` source
var imageReservation: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

Defaults to `0`. The value reserves space in the axis that corresponds to imagePlacement. If the image is larger than the reservation value in that axis, the system ignores the reservation value. Otherwise, the system centers the image in the space that the reservation value provides.

If the image is a symbol image, the system scales the reservation value with dynamic type, based on the image configuration.
