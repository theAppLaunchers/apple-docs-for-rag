Protocol

# UIWebViewDelegate

The `UIWebViewDelegate` protocol defines methods that a delegate of a UIWebView object can optionally implement to intervene when web content is loaded.

iOSiPadOS

``` source
@MainActor
protocol UIWebViewDelegate : NSObjectProtocol
```

## Overview

Important

Before releasing an instance of `UIWebView` for which you have set a delegate, you must first set the `UIWebView` delegate property to `nil` before disposing of the `UIWebView` instance. This can be done, for example, in the dealloc method where you dispose of the `UIWebView`.
