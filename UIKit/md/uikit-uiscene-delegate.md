var delegate: (any UISceneDelegate)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The system creates a default delegate object based on the the class name you provide in your appâ€™s `Info.plist` file, or that your app delegate specifies when configuring the scene. You can change this default delegate object later, as needed.
