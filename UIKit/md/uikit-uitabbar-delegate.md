protocol UITabBarDelegate

The UITabBarDelegate protocol defines optional methods for a delegate of a UITabBar object. The UITabBar class provides the ability for the user to reorder, remove, and add items to the tab bar; this process is referred to as customizing the tab bar. The tab bar delegate receives messages when customizing occurs.
