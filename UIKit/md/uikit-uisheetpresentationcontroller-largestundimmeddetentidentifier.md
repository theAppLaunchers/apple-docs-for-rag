```

## Discussion

The default value is `nil`, which means the system adds a noninteractive dimming view underneath the sheet at all detents. Set this property to only add the dimming view at detents larger than the detent you specify. For example, set this property to medium to add the dimming view at the large detent.

Without a dimming view, the undimmed area around the sheet responds to user interaction, allowing for a nonmodal experience. You can use this behavior for sheets with interactive content underneath them.
