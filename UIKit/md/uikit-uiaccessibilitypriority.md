## Overview

Use these constants either with the accessibilitySpeechAnnouncementPriority property of AttributedString, or with the accessibilitySpeechAnnouncementPriority (Swift) or UIAccessibilitySpeechAttributeAnnouncementPriority (Objective-C) attributed key. For example, the following code shows how to create an announcement with a high announcement priority:

```
let highPriorityAnnouncement = NSAttributedString(string: "Camera active", attributes:
[NSAttributedString.Key.accessibilitySpeechAnnouncementPriority: UIAccessibilityPriority.high])
```

## Topics

static let `default`: UIAccessibilityPriority

A default-priority announcement that interrupts existing speech, but is interruptible if a new speech utterance starts.

static let low: UIAccessibilityPriority

A low-priority announcement that the system queues and speaks after other speech utterances are complete.
