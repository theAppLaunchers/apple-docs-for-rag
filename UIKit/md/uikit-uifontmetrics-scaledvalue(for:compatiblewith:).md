``` source
func scaledValue(
    for value: CGFloat,
    compatibleWith traitCollection: UITraitCollection?
) -> CGFloat
```

## Parameters 

`value`  

The height value that you want to scale. Specify the height of the object that contains the text (at the standard Dynamic Type size) that you want to display.

`traitCollection`  

The trait collection to use when determining compatibility. The returned value is appropriate for use in an interface that adopts the specified traits.

## Return Value

A layout height that is scaled appropriately to accommodate the text that you want to display.

## Discussion

Use this method to scale the height of visual elements containing text. For example, if you define a button with text that can scale based on Dynamic Type, you would use this method to obtain an appropriately scaled height for your buttonâ€™s background content.
