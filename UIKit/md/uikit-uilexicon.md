Configuring a custom keyboard interface

## Overview

To obtain the lexicon, call the requestSupplementaryLexicon(completion:) method of the UIInputViewController class. This method can be called only from a custom keyboard app extension. A lexicon contains words from various sources, including:

- Unpaired first names and last names from the userâ€™s Address Book database

- Text shortcuts defined in the Settings \> General \> Keyboard \> Shortcuts list

- A common words dictionary

Apple intends for you to consider the words in a lexicon object as supplementary to an autocorrection/suggestion lexicon of your own design. For information on custom keyboards, see Custom Keyboard in App Extension Programming Guide.
