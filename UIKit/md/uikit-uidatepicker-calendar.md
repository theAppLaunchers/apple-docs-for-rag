## Discussion

The default value of this property corresponds to the userâ€™s current calendar as configured in Settings. This is equivalent to the value returned by calling the NSCalendar class method current. Setting this property to `nil` is equivalent to setting it to its default value.

Calendars specify the details of cultural systems used for reckoning time; they identify the beginning, length, and divisions of a year.
