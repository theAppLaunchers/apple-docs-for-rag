Instance Property

# priority

The priority of the constraint.

``` source
@MainActor
var priority: UILayoutPriority { get set }
```

## Discussion

By default, all constraints are required; this property is set to required in macOS or `UILayoutPriorityRequired` in iOS.

If a constraintâ€™s priority level is less than required in macOS or `UILayoutPriorityRequired` in iOS, then it is optional. Higher priority constraints are satisfied before lower priority constraints; however, optional constraint satisfaction is not all or nothing. If a constraint `a == b` is optional, the constraint-based layout system will attempt to minimize `abs(a-b)`.

Priorities may not change from nonrequired to required, or from required to nonrequired. An exception will be thrown if a priority of required in macOS or `UILayoutPriorityRequired` in iOS is changed to a lower priority, or if a lower priority is changed to a required priority after the constraints is added to a view. Changing from one optional priority to another optional priority is allowed even after the constraint is installed on a view.

Priorities must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to required in macOS or `UILayoutPriorityRequired` in iOS.

### Getting the layout priority

struct UILayoutPriority

The layout priority is used to indicate to the constraint-based layout system which constraints are more important, allowing the system to make appropriate tradeoffs when satisfying the constraints of the system as a whole.
