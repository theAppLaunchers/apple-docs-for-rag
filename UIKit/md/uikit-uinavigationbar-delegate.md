# delegate

The navigation barâ€™s delegate object.

``` source
@MainActor
weak var delegate: (any UINavigationBarDelegate)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The delegate must conform to the UINavigationBarDelegate protocol. The default value is `nil`.

If the navigation bar was created by a navigation controller and is being managed by that object, you must not change the value of this property. A navigation controller acts as the delegate for the navigation bar it creates.
