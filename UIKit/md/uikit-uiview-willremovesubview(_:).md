``` source
@MainActor
func willRemoveSubview(_ subview: UIView)
```

## Parameters 

`subview`  

The subview that will be removed.

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method does nothing. Subclasses can override it to perform additional actions whenever subviews are removed. This method is called when the subviewâ€™s superview changes or when the subview is removed from the view hierarchy completely.
