## Discussion

For this notification to be sent, you must set the isBatteryMonitoringEnabled property to true.

Notifications for battery level change are sent no more frequently than once per minute. Donâ€™t attempt to calculate battery drainage rate or battery time remaining; drainage rate can change frequently depending on built-in applications as well as your application.

You can obtain the battery level by getting the value of the batteryLevel property.
