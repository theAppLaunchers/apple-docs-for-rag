## Discussion

By default, this property contains an empty array. Assign an array of UIDocumentBrowserAction objects to add custom document browser actions.

Document browser actions can be accessed in two ways:

- *Navigation bar* actions appear in the Navigation bar when the user places the browser into the Select mode.

- *Menu* actions appear when the user long presses on a document or folder.

When triggered, these actions are passed the URLs of the currently selected items.
