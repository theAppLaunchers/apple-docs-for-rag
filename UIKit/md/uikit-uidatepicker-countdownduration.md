## Discussion

Use this property to get and set the currently selected value when the date pickerâ€™s mode property is set to UIDatePicker.Mode.countDownTimer. This property is of type TimeInterval and therefore is measured in seconds, although the date picker displays only hours and minutes. If the mode of the date picker is not UIDatePicker.Mode.countDownTimer, this value is undefined; refer instead to the date property. The default value is 0.0 and the maximum value is 23:59 (86,340 seconds).
