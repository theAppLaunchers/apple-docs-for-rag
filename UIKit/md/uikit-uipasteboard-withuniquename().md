``` source
class func withUniqueName() -> UIPasteboard
```

## Return Value

An app pasteboard object with a unique name.

## Discussion

Obtain the value of the name property to discover the name of the returned pasteboard. App pasteboards returned by this method are not persistent, existing only until the app quits. Starting in iOS 10, persistent named pasteboards are deprecated. Instead use a shared container, as described in the overview for the UIPasteboard class.
