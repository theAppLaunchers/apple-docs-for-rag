## Discussion

`UIPrintInteractionController` sets this property immediately after the user selects a printer and before it calls the delegateâ€™s printInteractionControllerWillStartJob(_:) method. If its delegate implements the printInteractionController(_:choosePaper:) method of the `UIPrintInteractionControllerDelegate` protocol, it can return the UIPrintPaper object to assign to this property. Otherwise, UIKit assigns an object with a default paper size and printing rectangle that is based on the output type and the capabilities of the destination printer. This object is released when the print job finishes.
