## Discussion

It isnâ€™t necessary to check this value before adding a UILargeContentViewerInteraction to a view, but it may be helpful if you need to adjust the behavior of coexisting gesture handlers. For example, a button with a long press handler might increase its long press duration so the user can read the text in the large content viewer first.
