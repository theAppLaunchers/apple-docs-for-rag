`dragItem`  

The dragged item that you want to animate into position.

`indexPath`  

The index path in the collection view at which to incorporate the item.

`rect`  

The destination rectangle to use for the animation. Specify the rectangle in the coordinate system of the cell at the specified `indexPath`. UIKit animates the drag item to the specified rectangle.

Use this method to animate drops where you incorporate the dragged items into another item of your collection view. For example, when incorporating items into a folder, youâ€™d use this method to animate the items in a way that makes it look like they were placed into the folder.
