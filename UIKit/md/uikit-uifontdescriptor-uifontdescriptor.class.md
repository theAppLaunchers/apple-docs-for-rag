## Discussion

These values correspond closely to the font class values in the OpenType OS/2 table. The class values are bundled in the upper four bits of the UIFontDescriptor.SymbolicTraits and can be accessed through classMask. For additional information about the specific meaning of each identifier, refer to the OpenType specification.
