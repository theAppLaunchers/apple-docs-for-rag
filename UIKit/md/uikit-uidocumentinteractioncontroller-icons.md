## Discussion

This property contains an array of UIImage objects containing the available icons for the given file. The images in the array are sorted from smallest to largest, with the smallest image located at index 0. The returned array always contains at least one image.

The images themselves are provided by the system and determined by the UTI of the file. Apps can register custom icons for their associated files by including the appropriate meta information in their `Info.plist` file. If no custom icon exists, the images in this property represent the generic document icon.
