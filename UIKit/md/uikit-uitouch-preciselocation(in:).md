``` source
@MainActor
func preciseLocation(in view: UIView?) -> CGPoint
```

## Parameters 

`view`  

The view that contains the touch.

## Return Value

A precise location for the touch.

## Mentioned in 

Implementing coalesced touch support in an app

## Discussion

Use this method to get additional precision for a touch (when available). Do not use the returned point for hit testing. In some cases, hit testing can indicate that the touch is within a view, but hit testing against the more precise location may indicate that the touch is outside of the view.
