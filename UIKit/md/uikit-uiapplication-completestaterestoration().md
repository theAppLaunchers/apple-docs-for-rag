## Discussion

UIKit restores your appâ€™s state synchronously on the main thread. If you choose to perform additional state restoration on a secondary thread, call the extendStateRestoration() method to inform UIKit of that fact. Call this method after you finish with your background work to let the system know that state restoration is complete.
