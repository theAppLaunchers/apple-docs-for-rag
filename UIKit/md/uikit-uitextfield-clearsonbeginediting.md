``` source
@MainActor
var clearsOnBeginEditing: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

If this property is set to true, the text fieldâ€™s previous text is cleared when the user selects the text field to begin editing. If false, the text field places an insertion point at the place where the user tapped the field.

Note

Even if this property is set to true, the text field delegate can override this behavior by returning false from its textFieldShouldClear(_:) method.
