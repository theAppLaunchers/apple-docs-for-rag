## Discussion

This property is typically used to provide a view controller to replace the system-supplied keyboard thatâ€™s presented for UITextField and UITextView objects.

The value of this read-only property is `nil`. If you want to provide a custom input view controller to replace the system keyboard in your app, redeclare this property as read-write in a UIResponder subclass. You can then use this property to manage a custom input view controller. When the responder becomes the first responder, the responder infrastructure presents the specified input view controller automatically. Similarly, when the responder resigns its first responder status, the responder infrastructure automatically dismisses the specified input view controller.
