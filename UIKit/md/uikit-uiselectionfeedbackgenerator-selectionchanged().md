## Discussion

This method tells the generator that the user has changed a selection. In response, the generator may play the appropriate haptics. Donâ€™t use this feedback when the user makes or confirms a selection; use it only when the selection changes.

For information on setting up a feedback generator, see the UIFeedbackGenerator class.
