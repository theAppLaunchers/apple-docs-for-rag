## Overview

UIPrintInteractionController is the central class for printing in iOS. The shared instance of it represents a print job. A print job includes the content to print and information and options related to its printing, such as output type, job name, paper size, and orientation.

UIPrintInteractionController has four mutually exclusive properties for giving it the content to print:

- printingItem takes a single print-ready object.

- printingItems takes an array of print-ready objects.

- printFormatter takes a print formatter, an object that knows how to lay out content of a certain type.

- printPageRenderer takes a page renderer, a custom object that draws the content for printing.

If the showsPageRange property is true, the number of pages is more than 1, and you assign an object to any of these properties except for the printingItems property, the printing options include a control that allows users to select a page range.

When users tap a print button on the appâ€™s user interface, a controller object of the app should respond to the action message by obtaining the shared instance of UIPrintInteractionController and preparing it for the print job. When the app calls one of the `present...` methods (for example, present(animated:completionHandler:)), UIPrintInteractionController displays a view containing printing options. This interface is simple, allowing users to select a printer, specify the number of copies and possibly a range of pages, and choose single-sided or double-sided printing (if the printer supports duplex printing). When users make their selections and tap Print, the print job begins.

For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines.

## Topics

### Getting the shared controller instance

class var shared: UIPrintInteractionController

The shared print-interaction controller object.

### Assigning the delegate

var delegate: (any UIPrintInteractionControllerDelegate)?

The delegate of the print-interaction controller.

protocol UIPrintInteractionControllerDelegate

An optional set of methods that the delegate of the shared print-interaction controller implements.

### Determining printability

class var isPrintingAvailable: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the device supports printing.

class func canPrint(Data) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether UIKit can print the contents of a data object.

class func canPrint(URL) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether UIKit can print the file that the specified URL references.

class var printableUTIs: Set&lt;String>

Returns a set of the Uniform Type Identifiers for the types of data that UIKit can print.

### Providing the source of printable content

var printingItem: Any?

A single ready-to-print object.

var printingItems: [Any]?

An array of ready-to-print objects.

var printPageRenderer: UIPrintPageRenderer?

An object that draws pages of printable content when UIKit requests it.

var printFormatter: UIPrintFormatter?

An object that lays out the content of pages according to the kind of content.

### Presenting the printing user interface

func present(animated: Bool, completionHandler: UIPrintInteractionController.CompletionHandler?) -> Bool

Presents the iPhone printing user interface in a sheet, optionally animating it to slide up from the bottom of the screen.

func present(from: UIBarButtonItem, animated: Bool, completionHandler: UIPrintInteractionController.CompletionHandler?) -> Bool

Presents the iPad printing user interface in a popover view, optionally animating it from a bar-button item.

func present(from: CGRect, in: UIView, animated: Bool, completionHandler: UIPrintInteractionController.CompletionHandler?) -> Bool

Presents the iPad printing user interface in a popover view, optionally animating it from any area in a view.

func dismiss(animated: Bool)

Dismisses the printing-options sheet or popover.

### Printing directly to a printer

func print(to: UIPrinter, completionHandler: UIPrintInteractionController.CompletionHandler?) -> Bool

Prints directly to the specified printer.

typealias CompletionHandler

A completion handler for responding to the completion of a print job or for handling printing errors.

### Accessing print-job information

var printInfo: UIPrintInfo?

An object that encapsulates information about the print job.

var printPaper: UIPrintPaper?

An object that represents the paper size and printing area for the print job.

var showsNumberOfCopies: Bool

A Boolean value that determines whether the printing options include the number of copies.

var showsPaperSelectionForLoadedPapers: Bool

A Boolean value that determines whether the paper selection menu displays.

var showsPaperOrientation: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the printing options include the paper-orientation control.

var showsPageRange: Bool

A Boolean value that determines whether the printing options include a page-range control.

Deprecated

### Handling printing errors

let UIPrintErrorDomain: String

The string constant that defines the UIKit printing error domain.

struct UIPrintError

A structure that contains information about a printing error.

enum Code

Constants that specify the print error code.
