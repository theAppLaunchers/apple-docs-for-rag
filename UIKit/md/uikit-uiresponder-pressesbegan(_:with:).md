## Discussion

UIKit calls this method when a new button is pressed by the user. Use this method to determine which button was pressed and to take any needed actions.

The default implementation of this method forwards the message up the responder chain. When creating your own subclasses, call `super` to forward any events that you donâ€™t handle yourself.
