iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+

``` source
@MainActor
optional func applicationSignificantTimeChange(_ application: UIApplication)
```

## Parameters 

`application`  

Your singleton app object.

## Discussion

Examples of significant time changes include the arrival of midnight, an update of the time by a carrier, and the change to daylight savings time. The delegate can implement this method to adjust any object of the app that displays time or is sensitive to time changes.

Prior to calling this method, the app also posts a significantTimeChangeNotification notification to give interested objects a chance to respond to the change.

If your app is currently suspended, this message is queued until your app returns to the foreground, at which point it is delivered. If multiple time changes occur, only the most recent one is delivered.
