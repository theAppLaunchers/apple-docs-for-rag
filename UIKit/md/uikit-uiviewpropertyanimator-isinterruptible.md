## Discussion

When the value of this property is true, you can use the pauseAnimation() and stopAnimation(_:) methods to interrupt the animations and make changes. When the value of this property is false, the animations run to completion (and without interruption) after you call the startAnimation() method. If you use a view property animator object to implement an interruptible view controller transition, this property must be true.

It is a programmer error to change this property if the animatorâ€™s state property is not set to UIViewAnimatingState.inactive.
