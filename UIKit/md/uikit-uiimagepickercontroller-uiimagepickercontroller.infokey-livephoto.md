## Discussion

A Live Photo is a picture, that includes motion and sound from the moments just before and after its capture. On compatible devices, the Camera app captures all photos as Live Photos by default, but the imagePickerController:didFinishPickingImage:editingInfo: methodâ€™s `image` parameter contains only the still image representation.

To obtain the motion and sound content of a live photo for display (using the PHLivePhotoView class), include the `kUTTypeImage` and `kUTTypeLivePhoto` identifiers in the allowed media types when configuring an image picker controller. When the user picks or captures a Live Photo, the `editingInfo` dictionary contains the livePhoto key, with a PHLivePhoto representation of the photo as the corresponding value.
