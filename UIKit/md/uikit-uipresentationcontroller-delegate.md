```

## Discussion

When the appâ€™s size changes, the presentation controller works with this delegate object to determine an appropriate response. View controllers presented using the UIModalPresentationStyle.formSheet, UIModalPresentationStyle.popover, or UIModalPresentationStyle.custom style must change to use one of the full-screen presentation styles instead. The delegate can also opt to change the presented view controller entirely.

The object you assign to this property must conform to the UIAdaptivePresentationControllerDelegate protocol.
