Type Method

# setAnimationStart(\_:)

Sets the start time for the current animation block.

iOS 2.0–13.0DeprecatediPadOS 2.0–13.0DeprecatedMac Catalyst 13.1–13.1DeprecatedtvOSDeprecated

``` source
@MainActor
class func setAnimationStart(_ startDate: Date)
```

## Parameters 

`startDate`  

The time to begin the animations.

## Discussion

Call this method between the beginAnimations(_:context:) and commitAnimations() methods to specify the start time for that set of animations. And call this method prior to changing the animatable properties of your views. (Do not call this method in conjunction with a block-based animation.) If you do not call this method, the start time is set to the value returned by the CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() function, which begins the animations as soon as possible.

Use of this method is discouraged in iOS 4.0 and later. You should use the block-based animation methods to specify your animations instead.
