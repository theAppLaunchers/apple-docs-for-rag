## Discussion

Use this property to give the keyboard and the system information about the expected semantic meaning for the content that users enter. For example, you might specify emailAddress for a text field that users fill in to receive an email confirmation. When you provide this information about the content you expect users to enter in a text input area, the system can in some cases automatically select an appropriate keyboard and improve keyboard corrections and proactive integration with other text input opportunities.

Because the expected semantic meaning for each text input area should be identified as specifically as possible, you canâ€™t combine multiple values for one textContentType property. For possible values you can use, see UITextContentType; by default, the value of this property is `nil`.
