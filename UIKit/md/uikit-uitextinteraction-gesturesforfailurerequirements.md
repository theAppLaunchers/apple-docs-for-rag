## Discussion

If your app provides other gestures in the same view hierarchy, you may want to set up failure requirements between your appâ€™s gestures and the gestures added by the text interaction. To do this, use the require(toFail:) method to relate your gestures to those listed in gesturesForFailureRequirements.
