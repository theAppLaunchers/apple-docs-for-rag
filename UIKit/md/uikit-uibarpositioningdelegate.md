## Overview

Navigation bars, toolbars, and search bars all have delegates that support the UIBarPositioning protocol. The delegate can use the method of this protocol to specify the barâ€™s position when that bar is moved to a window. The UINavigationBarDelegate, UISearchBarDelegate, and UIToolbarDelegate protocols extend this protocol to allow for the positioning of those bars on the screen.

## Topics
