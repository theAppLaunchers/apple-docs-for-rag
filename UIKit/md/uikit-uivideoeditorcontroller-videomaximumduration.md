## Discussion

The system-enforced maximum duration for a video recording is 10 minutes; you can set this value to 10 minutes or less. The default value for this property is also 10 minutes.

The video editor user interface forces the user to trim a loaded movie to fit within this propertyâ€™s value prior to saving.
