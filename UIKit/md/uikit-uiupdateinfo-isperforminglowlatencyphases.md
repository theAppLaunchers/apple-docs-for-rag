```

## Discussion

The value of this property is true between the beforeLowLatencyEventDispatch and afterLowLatencyCATransactionCommit UI update phases. Keep any code you run in this part of the UI update as minimal as possible, especially when isImmediatePresentationExpected is `true`. Defer any processing that isnâ€™t critical for the current UI update until afterLowLatencyCATransactionCommit.
