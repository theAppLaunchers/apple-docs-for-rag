## Overview

Use groups to manipulate a group of dynamic items together and treat them as a single unit for the purpose of collisions. The group can contain dynamic items but cannot contain other UIDynamicItemGroup objects. You can add a group to any UIDynamicBehavior object.

The attributes of the dynamic item group are derived from the items of the group itself. The groupâ€™s bounds rectangle is the rectangle that encloses all of the contained dynamic items, and the center point of the group is the center point of the bounds rectangle.

## Topics
