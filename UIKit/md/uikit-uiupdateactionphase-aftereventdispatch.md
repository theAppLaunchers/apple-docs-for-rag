# afterEventDispatch

A phase that runs after standard event handlers.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+tvOS 18.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
@MainActor
class var afterEventDispatch: UIUpdateActionPhase { get }
```

## Discussion

This phase runs after UIEvent and UIGestureRecognizer handlers run for standard events. After that point, the app doesnâ€™t receive new user input events. However, if you request low-latency event dispatch using wantsLowLatencyEventDispatch, more events might dispatch in the low-latency event dispatch phase.

Use this phase to perform tasks after processing all user input events for the UI update, like starting a parallel rendering thread.
