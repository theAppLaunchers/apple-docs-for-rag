# Preferring one gesture over another

Use a gesture recognizer delegate object to determine the order in which gestures are recognized in your views.

## Overview

For any two gesture recognizers involved in a potential conflict, only one needs an associated delegate object, and that object must conform to the UIGestureRecognizerDelegate protocol. In your delegate, implement the methods you need for the appropriate resolution. The best way to see how to use these methods is with a few examples.

The following code shows how to recognize tap and double-tap gestures in the same view. The view in this example has two UITapGestureRecognizer objects, one of which is configured to require two taps. Normally, the single-tap gesture would always be recognized before the double-tap gesture, but you can use the gestureRecognizer(_:shouldRequireFailureOf:) method to reverse that behavior. The implementation of this method prevents the single-tap gesture from being recognized until after the double-tap gesture recognizer explicitly reaches the failed state, which happens when the touch sequence contains only one tap.

```
func gestureRecognizer(_ gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer, 
         shouldRequireFailureOf otherGestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool {
   // Don't recognize a single tap until a double-tap fails.
   if gestureRecognizer == self.tapGesture && 
          otherGestureRecognizer == self.doubleTapGesture {
      return true
   }
   return false
}
```

The following code shows how to recognize a swipe gesture before a pan gesture. In this case, the delegate object is attached to the swipe gesture recognizer and implements the gestureRecognizer(_:shouldBeRequiredToFailBy:) method. The logic of this method prevents the pan gesture from being recognized until the swipe gesture fails.

```
func gestureRecognizer(_ gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer, 
         shouldBeRequiredToFailBy otherGestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool {
   // Do not begin the pan until the swipe fails. 
   if gestureRecognizer == self.swipeGesture && 
          otherGestureRecognizer == self.panGesture {
      return true
   }
   return false
}
```

The following code shows an alternative way to configure the dependency between a swipe and a pan gesture. Instead of attaching a delegate object to the swipe gesture, this example attaches the delegate to the pan gesture. Because of the change, the delegate must now implement the gestureRecognizer(_:shouldRequireFailureOf:) method and require the swipe to fail. The end results are the same as those from the previous example.

```
func gestureRecognizer(_ gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer, 
         shouldRequireFailureOf otherGestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool {
   if gestureRecognizer == self.panGesture && 
          otherGestureRecognizer == self.swipeGesture {
      return true
   }
   return false
}
```

The ability to attach a delegate to any gesture recognizer lets you create complex dependency chains among your gestures. For more information about regulating gesture recognition, see UIGestureRecognizerDelegate.
