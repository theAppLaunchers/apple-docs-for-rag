## Discussion

Assigning a value to this property installs the corresponding bar button items so that they trail the typing suggestions. (In a left-to-right environment, leading items are placed to the right of the typing suggestions.) If there is not enough room to display all of the items, UIKit may display a groupâ€™s representative item instead, if one was provided.
