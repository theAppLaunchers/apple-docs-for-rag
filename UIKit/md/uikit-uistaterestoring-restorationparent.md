## Discussion

Returning an object from this property lets you use the same restoration identifier for objects with similar behavior but different parents. When registering objects, the registerObject(forStateRestoration:restorationIdentifier:) method checks the value of this property, using the value as the containing scope for the object. For example, an object associated with a view controller can make the view controller its parent.
