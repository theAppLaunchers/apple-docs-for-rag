## Discussion

The value of this property is true if the view can become focused; false otherwise.

By default, the value of this property is false. This property informs the focus engine if a view is capable of being focused. Sometimes even if a view returns true, a view may not be focusable for the following reasons:

- The view is hidden.

- The view has alpha set to 0.

- The view has `userInteractionEnabled` set to false.

- The view is not currently in the view hierarchy.
