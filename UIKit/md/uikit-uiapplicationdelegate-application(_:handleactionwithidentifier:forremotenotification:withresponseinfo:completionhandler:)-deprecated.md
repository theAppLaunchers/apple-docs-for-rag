    _ application: UIApplication,
    handleActionWithIdentifier identifier: String?,
    forRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any],
    withResponseInfo responseInfo: [AnyHashable : Any],

Use userNotificationCenter(_:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:) instead.

## Parameters 

`application`  

The app object that was activated for the user-selected action.

`identifier`  

The identifier for the custom action.

`userInfo`  

A dictionary that contains information related to the remote notification, potentially including a badge number for the app icon, an alert sound, an alert message to display to the user, a notification identifier, and custom data. The provider originates it as a JSON-defined dictionary that iOS converts to an NSDictionary object; the dictionary might contain only property-list objects plus NSNull.

`responseInfo`  

The data dictionary sent by the action.

`completionHandler`  

A block that you must call when you are finished performing the action.

## Discussion

A `nil` value in the `identifier` parameter indicates the default action.

Call the completion handler as soon as you’ve finished handling the action.
