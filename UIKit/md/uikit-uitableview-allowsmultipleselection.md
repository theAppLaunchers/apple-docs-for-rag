## Mentioned in 

Handling row selection in a table view

## Discussion

This property controls whether a user can select multiple rows simultaneously outside of editing mode. Selected rows acquire a selected appearance.

In iOS, when the value of this property is true, the user can select additional rows by tapping on them. The user must tap a currently selected row to deselect it.

In macOS, when the value of this property is true, the user can select additional rows by holding the Command or Shift key while clicking on the additional rows they want to select. If the user isnâ€™t holding a modifier key, clicking on another row clears the current selection and selects only the clicked row. This behavior resembles the selection behavior of NSTableView.

If you access indexPathsForSelectedRows, you can get the index paths that identify the selected rows.

The default value of this property is false.
