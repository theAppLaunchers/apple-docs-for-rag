## Mentioned in 

Handling row selection in a table view

## Discussion

Calling this method doesn’t cause the delegate to receive a tableView(_:willDeselectRowAt:) or tableView(_:didDeselectRowAt:) message, nor does it send selectionDidChangeNotification notifications to observers.

Calling this method doesn’t cause any scrolling to the deselected row.
