## Overview

A date picker style determines how your app displays the date picker value and its editor. For instance, a date picker with a datePickerMode of UIDatePicker.Mode.dateAndTime and datePickerStyle of UIDatePickerStyle.compact displays the date pickerâ€™s value as a label that the user can tap to view a calendar-style editor. On the other hand, the same date picker using the UIDatePickerStyle.inline style displays a view that lets the user edit the value without having to tap the label shown in the UIDatePickerStyle.compact style.
