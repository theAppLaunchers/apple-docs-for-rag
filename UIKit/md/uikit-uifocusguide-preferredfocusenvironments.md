## Discussion

Setting this property to a nonempty array marks this guideâ€™s layoutFrame as focusable. If empty, this guide is effectively disabled.

If focused, the guide attempts to redirect focus to each environment in the array, in order, stopping when a focusable item in an environment has been found.
