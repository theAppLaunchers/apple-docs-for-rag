Instance Property

# orientation

The physical orientation of the device.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+

``` source
@MainActor
var orientation: UIDeviceOrientation { get }
```

## Discussion

The value of the property is a constant that indicates the current orientation of the device. This value represents the physical orientation of the device and may be different from the current orientation of your applicationâ€™s user interface. See UIDeviceOrientation for descriptions of the possible values.

The value of this property always returns 0 unless orientation notifications have been enabled by calling beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications().
