## Discussion

Subclasses that provide additional UI using a view controller can override this method to return that view controller. If this method returns a valid object, the system presents the returned view controller modally instead of calling the perform() method.

Your custom view controller should provide a view with your custom UI and should handle any user interactions inside those views. Upon completing the activity, donâ€™t dismiss the view controller yourself. Instead, call the activityDidFinish(_:) method and let the system dismiss it for you.
