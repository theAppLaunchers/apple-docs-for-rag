## Discussion

If this property is false, scrolling is permitted in both horizontal and vertical directions. If this property is true and the user begins dragging in one general direction (horizontally or vertically), the scroll view disables scrolling in the other direction. If the drag direction is diagonal, then scrolling doesnâ€™t lock and the user can drag in any direction until the drag completes. The default value is false.
