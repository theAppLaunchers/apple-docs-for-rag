``` source
class func remove(withName pasteboardName: UIPasteboard.Name)
```

## Parameters 

`pasteboardName`  

The name of the pasteboard to be invalidated.

## Discussion

Invalidation of an app pasteboard frees up all resources used by it. Once a pasteboard is invalidated, you cannot use the it; `UIPasteboard` ignores any calls to it. The method has no effect if called with the name of a system pasteboard.
