``` source
@MainActor
convenience init(
    forURL url: URL,
    title: String?
)
```

``` source
@MainActor
convenience init(
    for url: URL,
    title: String?
)
```

## Parameters 

`url`  

An Internet address referencing a remote resource, such as a webpage.

`title`  

A title for the URL.

## Return Value

A drag preview for a URL that has a title.

## Discussion

This method creates a two-line drag item preview, with the title displayed on the first line. The second line is a textual representation of the URL that might not show the full URL string. Donâ€™t use a file URL. Passing `nil` for the title is the same as calling init(forURL:).
