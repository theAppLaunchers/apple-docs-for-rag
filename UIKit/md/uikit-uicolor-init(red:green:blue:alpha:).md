Initializer

# init(red:green:blue:alpha:)

Creates a color object using the specified opacity and RGB component values.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
init(
    red: CGFloat,
    green: CGFloat,
    blue: CGFloat,
    alpha: CGFloat
)
```

## Parameters 

`red`  

The red value of the color object. On applications linked for iOS 10 or later, the color is specified in an extended color space, and the input value is never clamped. On earlier versions of iOS, red values below 0.0 are interpreted as 0.0, and values above 1.0 are interpreted as 1.0.

`green`  

The green value of the color object. On applications linked for iOS 10 or later, the color is specified in an extended color space, and the input value is never clamped. On earlier versions of iOS, green values below 0.0 are interpreted as 0.0, and values above 1.0 are interpreted as 1.0.

`blue`  

The blue value of the color object. On applications linked for iOS 10 or later, the color is specified in an extended color space, and the input value is never clamped. On earlier versions of iOS, blue values below 0.0 are interpreted as 0.0, and values above 1.0 are interpreted as 1.0.

`alpha`  

The opacity value of the color object, specified as a value from 0.0 to 1.0. Alpha values below 0.0 are interpreted as 0.0, and values above 1.0 are interpreted as 1.0.

## Return Value

The color object. The color information represented by this object is in an RGB colorspace. On applications linked for iOS 10 or later, the color is specified in an extended range sRGB color space. On earlier versions of iOS, the color is specified in a device RGB colorspace.
