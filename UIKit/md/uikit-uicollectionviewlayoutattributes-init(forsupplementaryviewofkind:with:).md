Initializer

# init(forSupplementaryViewOfKind:with:)

Creates and returns a layout attributes object that represents the specified supplementary view.

iOS 6.0+iPadOS 6.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+

``` source
@MainActor
convenience init(
    forSupplementaryViewOfKind elementKind: String,
    with indexPath: IndexPath
)
```

## Parameters 

`elementKind`  

A string that identifies the type of supplementary view.

`indexPath`  

The index path of the view.

## Return Value

A new layout attributes object whose precise type matches the type of the class used to call this method.

## Discussion

Use this method to create a layout attributes object for a supplementary view in the collection view. Like cells, supplementary views present data that is managed by the collection viewâ€™s data source. But unlike cells, supplementary views are typically designed for a special purpose. For example, header and footer views are laid out differently than cells and can be provided for individual sections or for the collection view as a whole.

It is up to you to decide how to use the `indexPath` parameter to identify a given supplementary view. Typically, you use the `elementKind` parameter to identify the type of the supplementary view and the `indexPath` information to distinguish between different instances of that view.
