```

**Required**

## Parameters 

`dataSourceUpdates`  

The handler block to execute as part of committing your changes. Use this block to update your collection viewâ€™s data source with the actual data that you received. This block has no return value and takes the following parameter:

insertionIndexPath  
The location at which to insert any items. Always use this index path for the insertion point instead of any cached values.

## Return Value

true if the placeholder was replaced by your content or false if the placeholder was no longer in the collection view.

## Discussion

When you receive the actual data for a cell, call this method to remove the corresponding placeholder cell and insert the actual cell. If the placeholder cell is still present in the collection view, this method calls the `dataSourceUpdates` handler. Use that handler block to update the data source object of the collection view. Do not update the collection view itself. This method automatically updates the collection view, creating a new cell for your data.

If the placeholder cell is no longer present, this method does not execute your `dataSourceUpdates` block.
