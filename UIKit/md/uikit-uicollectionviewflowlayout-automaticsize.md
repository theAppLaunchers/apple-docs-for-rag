## Discussion

Set this constant as the value for the estimatedItemSize property to enable self-sizing cells for your collection view. This is a non-zero, placeholder value that tells the collection view to query each cell for its actual size using the cellâ€™s preferredLayoutAttributesFitting(_:) method.
