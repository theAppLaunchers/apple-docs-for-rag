``` source
@MainActor
optional func textPasteConfigurationSupporting(
    _ textPasteConfigurationSupporting: any UITextPasteConfigurationSupporting,
    combineItemAttributedStrings itemStrings: [NSAttributedString],
    for textRange: UITextRange
) -> NSAttributedString
```

## Parameters 

`textPasteConfigurationSupporting`  

The object that received the paste or drop request.

`itemStrings`  

An array of attributed strings that will be combined to form a single attributed string.

`textRange`  

The position in the text view where the paste or drop operation will place the text.

## Return Value

An attributed string based on the combination of multiple strings.

## Discussion

You implement this method when you need to change how the item strings are combined to form the single attributed string. If this method isnâ€™t implemented, the item strings are concatenated without any delimiters.
