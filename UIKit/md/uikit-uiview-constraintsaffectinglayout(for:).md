Instance Method

# constraintsAffectingLayout(for:)

Returns the constraints impacting the layout of the view for a given axis.

iOS 6.0+iPadOS 6.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+

``` source
@MainActor
func constraintsAffectingLayout(for axis: NSLayoutConstraint.Axis) -> [NSLayoutConstraint]
```

## Parameters 

`axis`  

The axis for which the constraints should be found.

## Return Value

The constraints impacting the layout of the view for the specified axis.

## Discussion

The returned set of constraints may not all include the view explicitly. Constraints that impact the location of the view implicitly may also be included. While this provides a good starting point for debugging, there is no guarantee that the returned set of constraints will include all of the constraints that have an impact on the viewâ€™s layout in the given orientation.

This method should only be used for debugging constraint-based layout. No application should ship with calls to this method as part of its operation.

var hasAmbiguousLayout: Bool

A Boolean value that determines whether the constraints impacting the layout of the view incompletely specify the location of the view.

func exerciseAmbiguityInLayout()
