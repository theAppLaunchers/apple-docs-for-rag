```

## Discussion

Call this method whenever you modify the screen edges that defer system gestures, such as those that invoke Control Center, so the system can update accordingly. If the childForScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures property is `nil`, the system reads the edges from the current view controllerâ€™s preferredScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures property; otherwise, it uses the same property on the referenced child view controller.
