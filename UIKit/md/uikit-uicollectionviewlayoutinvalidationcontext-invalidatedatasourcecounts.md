## Discussion

You do not set this property yourself. The collection view sets it in response to specific types of layout invalidation scenarios. For example, the collection view sets it to true when you insert or delete items or call the collection viewâ€™s reloadData() method.

If this property is set to true, the layout object should query its delegate for the number of sections and items and update its layout based on the new number of items.
