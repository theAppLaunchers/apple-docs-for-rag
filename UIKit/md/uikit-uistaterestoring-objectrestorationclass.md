## Discussion

If an object has an associated restoration class, the object(withRestorationIdentifierPath:coder:) method of that class is called during state restoration. That method is responsible for returning the object that matches the provided path identifier information. If this property is`nil`, the object must already exist and be registered with the state restoration engine so that it can be found implicitly. You can register the object using the registerObject(forStateRestoration:restorationIdentifier:) method at launch time.

The restoration class must conform to the UIObjectRestoration protocol.
