## Discussion

Window levels provide a relative grouping of windows along the z-axis. All windows assigned to the same window level appear in front of (or behind) all windows assigned to a different window level. The ordering of windows within a given window level is not guaranteed.

The default value of this property is normal. For a list of other possible window levels, see UIWindow.Level.
