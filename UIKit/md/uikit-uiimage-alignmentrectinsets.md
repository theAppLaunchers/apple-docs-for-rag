## Discussion

You can use the inset values as a hint for specifying the image contents more precisely. For example, if you have a 20 x 20 pixel icon that includes a glow effect, you might set the insets to {{2, 2}, {16, 16}} to indicate the position of the underlying icon without the glow effect.

Objects that incorporate images can use these insets to place the image properly within their content.
