To fetch the `note` property in iOS 13 or later or macOS 13 or later, add the com.apple.developer.contacts.notes entitlement to your app. The entitlement requires permission from Apple to use, and you canâ€™t publicly distribute your app until you have permission to use it. For more information about adding the entitlement and getting permission, see com.apple.developer.contacts.notes.
