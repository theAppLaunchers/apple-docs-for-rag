## Overview

A contact (that is, an instance of CNContact) has properties, such as givenName, phoneNumbers, and jobTitle. Each property is represented by an instance of CNContactProperty, which provides a tuple that can contain three or five values, depending on whether the property is a member of an array of labeled values. For example, the phoneNumbers property is a member of an array of labeled values, so the `CNContactProperty` tuple contains the contact, key, value, identifier, and label. For the givenName property, which is not contained in a labeled array, `CNContactProperty` returns a tuple that contains the contact, key, and value. The `CNContactProperty` class is used by CNContactPicker to return the userâ€™s selected property.
