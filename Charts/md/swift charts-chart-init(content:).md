``` source
nonisolated
init(@ChartContentBuilder content: () -> Content)
```

## Parameters 

`content`  

A chart content builder that returns the marks that the chart should draw.

## Discussion

This initializer draws the marks that you specify in the `content` input. You can provide individual marks, or marks produced by one or more ForEach constructs, or any combination of these. As a convenience when you have exactly one `ForEach` in your chartâ€™s content, you can use either the init(_:content:) or init(_:id:content:) initializer instead, either of which wraps the content in an implicit `ForEach`.
