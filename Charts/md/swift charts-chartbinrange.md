``` source
struct ChartBinRange where Bound : Comparable
```

## Overview

All bins except the last for a particular chart represent an open range, meaning that the range doesnâ€™t include the upper bound. The last range of the last bin is closed, so that it does include the upper bound. The system keeps track of the open or closed state of a particular range.
