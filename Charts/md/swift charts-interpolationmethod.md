## Topics

### Type Properties

static var cardinal: InterpolationMethod

Interpolate data points with cardinal spline.

static var catmullRom: InterpolationMethod

Interpolate data points with Catmull-Rom spline.

static var linear: InterpolationMethod

Interpolate data points linearly.

static var monotone: InterpolationMethod

Interpolate data points with a cubic spline that preserves monotonicity of the data.

static var stepCenter: InterpolationMethod

Interpolate data points with a step, or piece-wise constant function, where the data point is at the center of the step.

static var stepEnd: InterpolationMethod

Interpolate data points with a step, or piece-wise constant function, where the data point is at the end of the step.

static var stepStart: InterpolationMethod

Interpolate data points with a step, or piece-wise constant function, where the data point is at the start of the step.

### Type Methods

static func cardinal(tension: CGFloat) -> InterpolationMethod

Interpolate data points with cardinal spline, using the given tension parameter.

static func catmullRom(alpha: CGFloat) -> InterpolationMethod

Interpolate data points with Catmull-Rom spline, using the given alpha parameter.
