# AudioGeneratorController

A controller that manages the playback of a real-time audio stream.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
@MainActor
class AudioGeneratorController
```

## Overview

To receive an audio generator controller, call an entityâ€™s prepareAudio(configuration:_:) or playAudio(configuration:_:) method.

The following examples show how you can use the controller:

```
```

```
// Create a configuration.
var config = AudioGeneratorConfiguration(kAudioChannelLayoutTag_Mono)

// Prepare a closure that you define in myHandler.mm.
var controller = myEntity.prepareAudio(configuration: config, myHandler)

controller.gain = -3.0
controller.play()
```

During playback, the audio appears to come from the entity that you use to create the controller. As a person moves around the MR scene, RealityKit modulates the characteristics of the audio to account for their location.

Note

Audio stops rendering when the system deallocates `AudioGeneratorController`. Create another `AudioGeneratorController` to restart audio.

Call stop() to halt the audio, and play() to restart the stream.
