``` source
@discardableResult @MainActor @preconcurrency
func align(
    _ originPin: GeometricPin,
    to targetPin: GeometricPin
) -> float4x4?
```

## Parameters 

`originPin`  

The `GeometricPin` to align. It should be one of the pins on the entity.

`targetPin`  

The `GeometricPin` to align to.

## Return Value

Transformation matrix that has been applied to the `Entity`, in the frame or reference of the parent of the `Entity`. If either pin doesnâ€™t exist, returns `nil`.
