## Discussion

The quantity that user sets via setForce(_:index:) has the units of mass \* distance / time. `impulse` mode causes a change in linear momentum.

The quantity that user sets via setTorque(_:index:) has the units of mass \* distance^2 / time. `impulse` mode causes a change in angular momentum.
