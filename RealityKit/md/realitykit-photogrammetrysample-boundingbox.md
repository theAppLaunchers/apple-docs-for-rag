# boundingBox

The bounding box of the scene or object being captured, represented as the transform of a unit cube centered at the origin into an oriented box in the sessionâ€™s world coordinate system. The transform can be factored as an SRT into the scale (axis length), orientation (rotation), and center (translation) using `Transform(matrix:)`.
