## Discussion

An entity in RealityKit can display a clearcoat, which is a separate layer of transparent specular highlights used to simulate a clear coating, like on a car or the surface of lacquered objects. This property allows you to specify a clearcoat normal and add waviness and imperfections to the top clearcoat.

To use clearcoat rendering, set `clearcoat` to a value greater than `0.0`.

This example shows how to set the `clearcoatNormal` using a UV-mapped image:

```
if let clearcoatNormalTextureResource = try?
TextureResource.load(named: "entity_cc_normalMap") {
    let ccNormalMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(clearcoatNormalTextureResource)
    material.clearcoatNormal = .init(texture: ccNormalMap)
}
```
