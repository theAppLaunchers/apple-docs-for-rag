## Discussion

To make a material *emissive* and appear to emit light, set this property to a value greater than zero and set emissiveColor to a value other than black. RealityKit multiplies emissiveColor by this value, so the higher the value, the more intense the entityâ€™s emission of light.

You can set this property to values greater than `1.0`.
