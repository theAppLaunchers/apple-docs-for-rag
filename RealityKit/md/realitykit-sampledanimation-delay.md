Instance Property

# delay

An amount of time that elapses before the animation plays.

``` source
var delay: TimeInterval { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value is `0`, which indicates that the animation plays with no delay. If you set a value for this property, the animation plays from its start time after the specified delay lapses.

During the delayed time, the animation doesn’t update. However, to fill the delayed time with some portion of animation, set a negative trimStart instead and choose a fillMode that displays the desired portion of animation.
