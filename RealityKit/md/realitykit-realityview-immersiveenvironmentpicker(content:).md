RealityKitSwiftUIvisionOS 2.0+

``` source

func immersiveEnvironmentPicker(@ViewBuilder content: () -> Content) -> some View where Content : View
```

## Discussion

These items are added alongside recently used system environments.

```
SystemPlayerView(player: player)
    .immersiveEnvironmentPicker {
        Button("Chalet", systemImage: "fireplace") {
            Task {
                await openImmersiveSpace(id: "Chalet")
            }
        }
    }
```

Use a `UIViewControllerRepresentable` instance to display a AVPlayerViewController class in your SwiftUI interface.

```
struct SystemPlayerView: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    let player: AVPlayer

    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> AVPlayerViewController {
        return AVPlayerViewController()
    }

    func updateUIViewController(_ avPlayerViewController: AVPlayerViewController, context: Context) {
        viewController.player = player
    }
}
```

Items will be donated to media players (like AVPlayerViewController) downstream in the hierarchy.
