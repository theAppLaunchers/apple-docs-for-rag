## Overview

Add, inspect, and remove geometric pins that belong to the entity that owns an instance of `GeometricPinsComponent` by accessing its pins property.

## Topics

### Initializers

init()

Creates a geometric pins component with an empty sequence of pins.

### Instance Properties

var pins: Set&lt;GeometricPin>

The sequence of geometric pins the component owns.

### Instance Methods

func removePin(named: String) -> GeometricPin?

Removes the pin associated with the name.

func set(pin: GeometricPin)

Adds a pin to the collection.

### Subscripts

subscript(String) -> GeometricPin?

Retrieves the pin by its name.
