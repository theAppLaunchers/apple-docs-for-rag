## Overview

`PhysicsRevoluteJoint` allows one rotational degree of freedom along the x-axis of two entity pins.

Tip

Pass an orientation when creating the GeometricPin instances to change the axis of rotation.

## Topics

### Operators

static func == (PhysicsRevoluteJoint, PhysicsRevoluteJoint) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

### Initializers

init(pin0: GeometricPin, pin1: GeometricPin, angularLimit: ClosedRange&lt;Float>?, checksForInternalCollisions: Bool)

Creates a new revolute joint.

### Instance Properties

var angularLimit: ClosedRange&lt;Float>?

A limit of the rotational freedom between the pins around the x-axis.

var checksForInternalCollisions: Bool

A Boolean that indicates whether the joint checks and reports collisions between the two entity instances.

var isActive: Bool

A Boolean that indicates whether the joint is active.

var pin0: GeometricPin

The pin that defines a local position and orientation on the first entity.

var pin1: GeometricPin

The pin that defines a local position and orientation on the second entity.
