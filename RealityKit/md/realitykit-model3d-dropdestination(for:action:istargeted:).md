``` source
nonisolated
func dropDestination(
    for payloadType: T.Type = T.self,
    action: @escaping ([T], CGPoint) -> Bool,
    isTargeted: @escaping (Bool) -> Void = { _ in }
) -> some View where T : Transferable
```

## Parameters 

`payloadType`  

The expected type of the dropped models.

`action`  

A closure that takes the dropped content and responds appropriately. The first parameter to `action` contains the dropped items. The second parameter contains the drop location in this viewâ€™s coordinate space. Return `true` if the drop operation was successful; otherwise, return `false`.

`isTargeted`  

A closure that is called when a drag and drop operation enters or exits the drop target area. The received value is `true` when the cursor is inside the area, and `false` when the cursor is outside.

## Return Value

A view that provides a drop destination for a drag operation of the specified type.

## Discussion

The dropped content can be provided as binary data, file URLs, or file promises.

The drop destination is the same size and position as this view.

```
@State private var isDropTargeted = false

var body: some View {
    Color.pink
        .frame(width: 400, height: 400)
        .dropDestination(for: String.self) { receivedTitles, location in
            animateDrop(at: location)
            process(titles: receivedTitles)
        } isTargeted: {
            isDropTargeted = $0
        }
}

func process(titles: [String]) { ... }
func animateDrop(at: CGPoint) { ... }
```
