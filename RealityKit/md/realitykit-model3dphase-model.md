var model: ResolvedModel3D? { get }

## Discussion

If this value isnâ€™t `nil`, the model load operation has finished, and you can use the model to update the view. You can use the model directly, or you can modify it in some way. For example, you can add a `ResolvedModel3D/resizable()` modifier to make the model resizable.
