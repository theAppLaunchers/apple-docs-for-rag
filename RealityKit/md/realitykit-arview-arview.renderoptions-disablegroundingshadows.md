# disableGroundingShadows

Disable rendering of ambient occlusion and shadows that ground objects in an AR scene.

iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+macOS 10.15+

``` source
static let disableGroundingShadows: ARView.RenderOptions
```

## Discussion

Objects in the real world cast a grounding shadow onto adjacent surfaces due to ambient light. This provides viewers with a visual cue that the object is in close proximity to the surface. Objects without a grounding shadow appear disconnected from their environment. To create the same visual cue for virtual objects, RealityKit provides a grounding shadow effect.

Applying this effect involves a low, constant GPU cost. You can disable the effect by adding the disableGroundingShadows option to the viewâ€™s renderOptions set, if needed. Disabling the effect is most useful for older devices, like those with an A9 processor or earlier.
