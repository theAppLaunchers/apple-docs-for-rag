Instance Method

# shuffled(using:)

Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.

``` source
func shuffled(using generator: inout T) -> [Self.Element] where T : RandomNumberGenerator
```

## Parameters 

`generator`  

The random number generator to use when shuffling the sequence.

## Return Value

An array of this sequence’s elements in a shuffled order.

## Discussion

You use this method to randomize the elements of a sequence when you are using a custom random number generator. For example, you can shuffle the numbers between `0` and `9` by calling the `shuffled(using:)` method on that range:

```
let numbers = 0...9
let shuffledNumbers = numbers.shuffled(using: &myGenerator)
// shuffledNumbers == [8, 9, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 0, 5, 1]
```

Complexity

O(*n*), where *n* is the length of the sequence.

Note

The algorithm used to shuffle a sequence may change in a future version of Swift. If you’re passing a generator that results in the same shuffled order each time you run your program, that sequence may change when your program is compiled using a different version of Swift.
