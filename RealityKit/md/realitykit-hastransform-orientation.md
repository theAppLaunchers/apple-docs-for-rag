``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
var orientation: simd_quatf { get set }
```

## Discussion

This value is the entityâ€™s rotation relative to its parent. To get the world-space orientation of the entity, use orientation(relativeTo:), passing `nil` as the reference entity.

This is the same as the rotation value on the transform.
