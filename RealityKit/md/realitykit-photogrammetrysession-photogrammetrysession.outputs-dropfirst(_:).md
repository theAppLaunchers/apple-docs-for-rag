# dropFirst(\_:)

Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.

``` source
func dropFirst(_ count: Int = 1) -> AsyncDropFirstSequence
```

## Parameters 

`count`  

The number of elements to drop from the beginning of the sequence. `count` must be greater than or equal to zero.

## Return Value

An asynchronous sequence that drops the first `count` elements from the base sequence.

## Discussion

Use `dropFirst(_:)` when you want to drop the first *n* elements from the base sequence and pass through the remaining elements.

In this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `10`. The `dropFirst(_:)` method causes the modified sequence to ignore the values `1` through `3`, and instead emit `4` through `10`:

```
for await number in Counter(howHigh: 10).dropFirst(3) {
    print(number, terminator: " ")
}
// Prints "4 5 6 7 8 9 10 "
```

If the number of elements to drop exceeds the number of elements in the sequence, the result is an empty sequence.

### Filtering the output

func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfy the given predicate.

func compactMap&lt;ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncThrowingCompactMapSequence&lt;Self, ElementOfResult>

func compactMap&lt;ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncCompactMapSequence&lt;Self, ElementOfResult>

Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.

func contains(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.

func drop(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncDropWhileSequence&lt;Self>

Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.

func prefix(Int) -> AsyncPrefixSequence&lt;Self>

Returns an asynchronous sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the base asynchronous sequence.

func prefix(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) rethrows -> AsyncPrefixWhileSequence&lt;Self>

Returns an asynchronous sequence, containing the initial, consecutive elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
