# PhysicsJointsComponent

A component that stores physics joints which RealityKit simulates.

``` source
struct PhysicsJointsComponent
```

## Overview

Add this component to an entity, or any child of an entity, that has a PhysicsSimulationComponent. All joints in the `PhysicsJointsComponent` need to reference entities under the same PhysicsSimulationComponent tree.

Add a joint to the correct `PhysicsJointsComponent` instance by calling its `PhysicsJoint/addToSimulation()-886c4` method.

## Topics

### Operators

static func == (PhysicsJointsComponent, PhysicsJointsComponent) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

### Initializers

init()

Creates a new physics joints component.

### Instance Properties

var joints: PhysicsJoints

The set of joints the physics joints component stores.
