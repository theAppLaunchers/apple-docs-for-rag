``` source
nonisolated
func lineLimit(_ number: Int?) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`number`  

The line limit. If `nil`, no line limit applies.

## Return Value

A view that limits the number of lines that `Text` instances display.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to cap the number of lines that an individual text element can display.

The line limit applies to all `Text` instances within a hierarchy. For example, an `HStack` with multiple pieces of text longer than three lines caps each piece of text to three lines rather than capping the total number of lines across the `HStack`.

In the example below, the modifier limits the very long line in the `Text` element to the 2 lines that fit within the viewâ€™s bounds:

```
Text("This is a long string that demonstrates the effect of SwiftUI's lineLimit(:_) operator.")
    .frame(width: 200, height: 200, alignment: .leading)
    .lineLimit(2)
```
