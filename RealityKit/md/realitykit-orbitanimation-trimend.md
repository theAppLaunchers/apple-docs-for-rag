Instance Property

# trimEnd

The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation stops.

``` source
var trimEnd: TimeInterval? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property is `nil` by default, which plays the animation until `time` = duration. If you set a value, the animation edits the duration according to the specified ending time.
