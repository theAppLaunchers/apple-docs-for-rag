## Discussion

Note

If the chamfer profile is `nil`, a circular profile is used.

The chamfer profile needs to satisfy the following conditions:

- The path is nonempty.

- The first point on the path is at (0, 0) and the last point is at (1, 1).

- The value of x along the profile either increases or stays the same. In other words, the profile curve may not wrap back on itself.
