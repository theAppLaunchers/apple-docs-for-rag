``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
var scale: SIMD3 { get set }
```

## Discussion

This value is the entityâ€™s scale relative to its parent. To get the actual scale of the entity in the scene, use scale(relativeTo:), passing `nil` as the reference entity.

This is the same as the scale value on the transform.
