``` source
case polygons([UInt8], [UInt32])
```

## Discussion

Each element in the first array represents a polygon and the elementâ€™s value indicates how many vertices in that polygon. The elements in the second array are the vertex indices for the polygons.

For example, to represent a triangle and a quadrilateral the first array has the elements `3` and `4`, and the second array has a total of 7 elements, one for every vertex in both polygons.

```
.polygons([3, 4], [
    0, 1, 2,
    3, 4, 5, 6
])
```
