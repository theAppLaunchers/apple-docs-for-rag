Initializer

# init(cubeFromImage:named:options:)

Synchronously creates a cube texture resource from a 2D image of cube faces.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
convenience init(
    cubeFromImage cgImage: CGImage,
    named resourceName: String? = nil,
    options: TextureResource.CreateOptions
) throws
```

## Parameters 

`cgImage`  

The source image.

`resourceName`  

A unique name for syncing the texture resource across the network. The name is empty if you don’t include one.

`options`  

A configuration for generating the texture.

## Discussion

Loading a TextureResource with this method blocks the main actor because it’s synchronous, so only call it from a command-line application. The method can stall a regular app, which makes it visibly hitch, and the system terminates an app if its UI becomes unresponsive. See init(named:in:) for an example that demonstrates how to safely load content.

RealityKit extracts the cube faces from the source 2D image using a convention based on its aspect ratio. See init(cubeFromImage:named:options:) for more details.

```
if let source = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url as CFURL, nil),
    let image = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex(source, 0, nil) {

    // Create a cube texture from the image.
    let cube = try TextureResource(
        cubeFromImage: image,
        options: TextureResource.CreateOptions(semantic: .hdrColor))

    // Create an environment resource from the cube texture.
    let environment = try EnvironmentResource(
        cube: cube, options: EnvironmentResource.CreateOptions())

    // Assign the environment to an image-based light component.
    let lightEntity = Entity()
    lightEntity.components.set(ImageBasedLightComponent(source: .single(environment)))
    ...
}
```
