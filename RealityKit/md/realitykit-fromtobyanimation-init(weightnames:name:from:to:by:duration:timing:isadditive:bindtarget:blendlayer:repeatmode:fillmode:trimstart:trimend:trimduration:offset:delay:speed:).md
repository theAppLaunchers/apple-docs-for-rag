Initializer

# init(weightNames:name:from:to:by:duration:timing:isAdditive:bindTarget:blendLayer:repeatMode:fillMode:trimStart:trimEnd:trimDuration:offset:delay:speed:)

Creates an animation that blends between a configuration of blend targets.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
init(
    weightNames: [String],
    name: String = "",
    from: Value? = nil,
    to: Value? = nil,
    by: Value? = nil,
    duration: TimeInterval = 1.0,
    timing: AnimationTimingFunction = .linear,
    isAdditive: Bool = false,
    bindTarget: BindTarget? = nil,
    blendLayer: Int32 = 0,
    repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode = .none,
    fillMode: AnimationFillMode = [],
    trimStart: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimEnd: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimDuration: TimeInterval? = nil,
    offset: TimeInterval = 0,
    delay: TimeInterval = 0,
    speed: Float = 1.0
)
```

Available when `Value` is `BlendShapeWeights`.

## Parameters 

`weightNames`  

The names of the weights in the animated blend shape.

`name`  

A unique name for the animation.

`from`  

The state of the target object’s weights before the animation starts.

`to`  

The state of the target object’s weights after the animation finishes.

`by`  

An amount that increments the animated weights during the animation.

`duration`  

The total playback time.

`timing`  

An option that determines the animation’s pace over time.

`isAdditive`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation blends additively with concurrent animations.

`bindTarget`  

A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.

`blendLayer`  

The order in which the framework composites the animation into the view.

`repeatMode`  

An option that determines how the animation repeats.

`fillMode`  

The playback behavior outside of the normal duration.

`trimStart`  

The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation plays.

`trimEnd`  

The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation stops.

`trimDuration`  

An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.

`offset`  

The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.

`delay`  

An amount of time that elapses before the animation plays.

`speed`  

A factor that increases or decreases the animation’s rate of playback.
