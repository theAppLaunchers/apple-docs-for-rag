## Discussion

Lumen per square meter, also known as lux, measures how much light is spread over an area. It tells you how bright a surface appears based on the light it receives.

The default value for this property is `2145.7078`.

Use the following table as an estimate for Lux levels:

| Environment                   | Typical Lux Level    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Full moon                     | 0.1 - 1 lux          |
| Street lighting               | 10 - 20 lux          |
| Living room lighting          | 50 - 100 lux         |
| Classroom                     | 250 - 750 lux        |
| Office lighting               | 300 - 500 lux        |
| Sunrise/Sunset on a clear day | 400 lux              |
| Overcast daylight             | 1000 - 2000 lux      |
| Photography studio lighting   | 1,000 - 2,000 lux    |
| Ambient daylight              | 10,000 - 25,000 lux  |
| Direct sunlight               | 32,000 - 100,000 lux |
