# SynchronizationComponent

A component that synchronizes an entity between processes and networked applications.

``` source
struct SynchronizationComponent
```

## Overview

An entity acquires a SynchronizationComponent instance by adopting the HasSynchronization protocol. All entities have this component because the Entity base class adopts the protocol.

## Topics

### Creating a synchronization component

init()

Creates a synchronization component.

### Identifying a synchronization component

var identifier: UInt64

A unique identifier of an entity within a network session.

### Managing ownership

var isOwner: Bool

A Boolean that indicates whether the calling process owns the entity.

var ownershipTransferMode: SynchronizationComponent.OwnershipTransferMode

The entityâ€™s transfer ownership mode.

### Registering a component type

static func registerComponent()

Registers a new component type.

### Comparing synchronization components

static func == (SynchronizationComponent, SynchronizationComponent) -> Bool

Indicates whether two synchronization components are equal.

static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are not equal.

### Enumerations

enum OwnershipTransferCompletionResult

The result of an ownership transfer request.

enum OwnershipTransferMode

Modes of ownership transfer.
