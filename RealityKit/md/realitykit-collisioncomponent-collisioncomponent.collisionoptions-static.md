## Discussion

When a collision object is static, it doesnâ€™t report collisions with static collision objects, only with dynamic collision objects. In contrast, when a collision object is dynamic (not static), it reports collisions with all other collision objects.

Note

Static collision objects are more light-weight and improve performance. They should be used where collisions are tested against these objects, not between these objects.
