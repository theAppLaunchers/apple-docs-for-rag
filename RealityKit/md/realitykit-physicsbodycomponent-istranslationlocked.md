``` source
var isTranslationLocked: (x: Bool, y: Bool, z: Bool)
```

## Discussion

You can restrict movement of the body along one or more axes by setting the corresponding item in the tuple to `true`. For example, if you set the `x` and the `z` items in the tuple to `true`, then the body can move only along the y-axis. By default, movement isnâ€™t restricted.
