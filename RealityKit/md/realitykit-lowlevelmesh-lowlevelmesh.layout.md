Structure

# LowLevelMesh.Layout

An object that describes a set of attributes that share a buffer index, offset, and stride.

## Overview

Applications typically express their types using contiguous or interleaved (strided) memory.

If you interleave your data (meaning that you represent it with a structure), use one `Layout` object where bufferStride is equal to `MemoryLayout.stride()`.

If you store your attributes separately, use one `Layout` per attribute.

## Topics

### Creating a low-level mesh layout

init(bufferIndex: Int, bufferOffset: Int, bufferStride: Int)

### Describing a low-level mesh layout

var bufferIndex: Int

The index of the buffer to use for this layout.

var bufferOffset: Int

The byte offset into the buffer for the first byte of this layout.

var bufferStride: Int

The distance, in bytes, between consecutive vertices for attributes using this layout.
