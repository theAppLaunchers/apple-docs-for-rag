## Discussion

Needs to be called after all commands in the command buffer have been executed (e.g. after `MTLCommandBuffer.waitUntilCompleted()`). When you call this method, the drawable will make the new texture content available to the renderer immediately.

Alternatively, instead of waiting for completion you can call `MTLCommandBuffer.present(_:)` to signal in the command buffer that the texture is ready to use.
