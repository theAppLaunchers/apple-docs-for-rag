# Character control, skeletons, and inverse kinematics

Direct the movements and animation of models.

## Overview

Games and immersive game-like experiences often rely on animated character models to represent the player or non-player characters. The `CharacterControllerComponent` simplifies the process of moving a character around a scene. It handles basic movement, including navigating up and down stairs and slopes and jumping. It also allows you to sync the character movement with specific animations.

To further animate models in the scene, you may need to define a SkeletalPose or adopt a full inverse kinematics solution with IKComponent.

## Topics

### Character control

struct CharacterControllerComponent

A component that manages character movement.

struct Collision

A container that holds collision state for the character controller.

struct CollisionFlags

An option set that specifies which parts of the character capsule have collided with other objects.

struct CharacterControllerStateComponent

A component that represents the state of a character controller.

### Skeletons

struct SkeletalPosesComponent

A component that exposes the collection of named animation skeletal poses.

struct SkeletalPose

A container that holds the position and orientation of each joint in a single animation skeleton.

typealias ID

A type representing the stable identity of the entity associated with an instance.

struct SkeletalPoseSet

A collection of named skeletal poses.

typealias Element

A type representing the sequenceâ€™s elements.

### Inverse kinematics components

struct IKComponent

A component that allows you to procedurally animate a skeletal model using a full body inverse kinematics solver.

class Joint

The update stage object that lets you read and update the current settings of a single joint in an IK solver.

struct JointCollection

Ordered dictionary like container with fixed size.

class Solver

The update stage object that lets you read and update the current settings of a single solver instance.

struct SolverCollection

Ordered dictionary like container with fixed size.

class Constraint

The update stage object that lets you read and update the current settings of a single constraint in an IK solver.

struct ConstraintCollection

Ordered dictionary like container with fixed size.

class IKResource

A reference counted immutable resource which contains one or more inverse kinematics solver rigs.

struct IKSolverDefinition

A container describing a solver instance.

typealias ID

A type representing the stable identity of the entity associated with an instance.

### Inverse kinematics rigs

struct IKRig

A full body inverse kinematics rig definition for a single skeleton.

struct Joint

A definition of a rig joint and its IK solver settings.

struct JointCollection

Ordered dictionary-like container with a fixed size.

struct Constraint

A definition of a rig constraint.

struct ConstraintsCollection

Ordered dictionary-like container.
