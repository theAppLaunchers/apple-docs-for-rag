Initializer

# init(bounds:rate:distanceOffset:)

Creates a spatial force falloff.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
init(
    bounds: ForceEffectBounds,
    rate: Double = 1.0,
    distanceOffset: Double = 0
)
```

## Parameters 

`bounds`  

The spatial bounds used to compute the strength falloff.

`rate`  

The rate at which the effectâ€™s strength diminishes.

`distanceOffset`  

The offset from the origin where fall begins.

## Discussion

- When the rate is **0**, no falloff occurs. (Rigid bodies outside the bounds are culled.)

- When the rate is **greater than 0 and less than 1.0**, falloff occurs slower and is sublinear.

- When the rate is **1.0**, falloff is linear.

- When the rate is **greater than 1**, falloff occurs faster and is nonlinear.
