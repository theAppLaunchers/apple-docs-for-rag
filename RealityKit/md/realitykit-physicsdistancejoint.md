## Overview

A distance joint restricts the distance between pin0 and pin1. The joint determines this closed range according to distanceLimit.

This joint allows full rotational freedom between pin0 and pin1.

## Topics

### Operators

static func == (PhysicsDistanceJoint, PhysicsDistanceJoint) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

### Initializers

init(pin0: GeometricPin, pin1: GeometricPin, distanceLimit: ClosedRange&lt;Float>, checksForInternalCollisions: Bool)

Creates a new distance joint.

### Instance Properties

var checksForInternalCollisions: Bool

A Boolean that indicates whether the joint checks and reports collisions between the two entity instances.

var distanceLimit: ClosedRange&lt;Float>

Specifies the minimum and maximum allowed distance between the pins.

var isActive: Bool

A Boolean that indicates whether the joint is active.

var pin0: GeometricPin

The pin that defines a local position and orientation on the first entity.

var pin1: GeometricPin

The pin that defines a local position and orientation on the second entity.

var tolerance: Float

An extension of the distance limit, as a percentage-based error tolerance.
