Instance Method

# layerEffect(\_:maxSampleOffset:isEnabled:)

Returns a new view that applies `shader` to `self` as a filter on the raster layer created from `self`.

RealityKitSwiftUIiOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 17.0+visionOS

``` source
nonisolated
func layerEffect(
    _ shader: Shader,
    maxSampleOffset: CGSize,
    isEnabled: Bool = true
) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`shader`  

The shader to apply as a layer effect.

`maxSampleOffset`  

If the shader function samples from the layer at locations not equal to the destination position, this value must specify the maximum sampling distance in each axis, for all source pixels.

`isEnabled`  

Whether the effect is enabled or not.

## Return Value

A new view that renders `self` with the shader applied as a distortion effect.

## Discussion

For a shader function to act as a layer effect it must have a function signature matching:

```
[[ stitchable ]] half4 name(float2 position,
  SwiftUI::Layer layer, args...)
```

where `position` is the user-space coordinates of the destination pixel applied to the shader, and `layer` is a subregion of the rasterized contents of `self`. `args...` should be compatible with the uniform arguments bound to `shader`.

The `SwiftUI::Layer` type is defined in the `` header file. It exports a single `sample()` function that returns a linearly-filtered pixel value from a position in the source content, as a premultiplied RGBA pixel value:

```
namespace SwiftUI {
  struct Layer {
    half4 sample(float2 position) const;
  };
};
```

The function should return the color mapping to the destination pixel, typically by sampling one or more pixels from `layer` at location(s) derived from `position` and them applying some kind of transformation to produce a new color.

Important

Views backed by AppKit or UIKit views may not render into the filtered layer. Instead, they log a warning and display a placeholder image to highlight the error.
