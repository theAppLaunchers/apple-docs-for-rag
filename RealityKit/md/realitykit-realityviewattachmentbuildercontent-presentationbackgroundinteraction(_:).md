## Discussion

On many platforms, SwiftUI automatically disables the view behind a sheet that you present, so that people canâ€™t interact with the backing view until they dismiss the sheet. Use this modifier if you want to enable interaction.

The following example enables people to interact with the view behind the sheet when the sheet is at the smallest detent, but not at the other detents:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showSettings = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("View Settings") {
            showSettings = true
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showSettings) {
            SettingsView()
                .presentationDetents(
                    [.height(120), .medium, .large])
                .presentationBackgroundInteraction(
                    .enabled(upThrough: .height(120)))
        }
    }
}
```
