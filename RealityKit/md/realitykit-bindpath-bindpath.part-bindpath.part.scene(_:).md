# BindPath.Part.scene(\_:)

A path component for a nested scene.

``` source
case scene(String)
```

## Discussion

This path component indicates that another component follows, and at the same time specifies the entity, scene, or property that animates.

Because no path contains nested scenes, this component exists only as the first element of a multicomponent path.
