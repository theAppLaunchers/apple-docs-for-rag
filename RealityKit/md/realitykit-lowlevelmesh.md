## Mentioned in 

Creating a plane with low-level mesh

## Overview

Use `LowLevelMesh` when you want to bring your own vertex format to RealityKit or update your data frequently. To update your data in `LowLevelMesh`, you can either use Swift for CPU processing, or Metal Compute Shaders for GPU processing.

Note

Use MeshDescriptor for a simpler alternative to `LowLevelMesh`. For information on loading a model from a USD or Reality file, see Loading entities from a file.

Express your vertex by creating a LowLevelMesh.Descriptor that describes your layout, along with the required index and vertex capacities. This descriptor is similar to MTLVertexDescriptor, with additional semantics that make the data available in your shaders.

To use `LowLevelMesh`, first define your own vertex structure, either in a Metal header or using a Swift structure:

```
struct MyVertex {
    var position: SIMD3 = .zero
    var color: UInt32 = .zero
}
```

Next, describe your structure to `LowLevelMesh` by creating a list of vertex attributes and a vertex layout. This description informs `LowLevelMesh` how to represent the vertex data in memory:

```
extension MyVertex {
    static var vertexAttributes: [LowLevelMesh.Attribute] = [
        .init(semantic: .position, format: .float3, offset: MemoryLayout.offset(of: \.position)!),
        .init(semantic: .color, format: .uchar4Normalized_bgra, offset: MemoryLayout.offset(of: \.color)!)
    ]

    static var vertexLayouts: [LowLevelMesh.Layout] = [
        .init(bufferIndex: 0, bufferStride: MemoryLayout.stride)
    ]

    static var descriptor: LowLevelMesh.Descriptor {
        var desc = LowLevelMesh.Descriptor()
        desc.vertexAttributes = MyVertex.vertexAttributes
        desc.vertexLayouts = MyVertex.vertexLayouts
        desc.indexType = .uint32
        return desc
    }
}
```

Create a LowLevelMesh.Descriptor and `LowLevelMesh`, and assign your mesh data and parts:

```
func triangleMesh() throws -> LowLevelMesh {
    var desc = MyVertex.descriptor
    desc.vertexCapacity = 3
    desc.indexCapacity = 3

    let mesh = try LowLevelMesh(descriptor: desc)

    mesh.withUnsafeMutableBytes(bufferIndex: 0) { rawBytes in
        let vertices = rawBytes.bindMemory(to: MyVertex.self)
        vertices[0] = MyVertex(position: [-1, -1, 0], color: 0xFF00FF00)
        vertices[1] = MyVertex(position: [ 1, -1, 0], color: 0xFFFF0000)
        vertices[2] = MyVertex(position: [ 0,  1, 0], color: 0xFF0000FF)
    }

    mesh.withUnsafeMutableIndices { rawIndices in
        let indices = rawIndices.bindMemory(to: UInt32.self)
        indices[0] = 0
        indices[1] = 1
        indices[2] = 2
    }

    let meshBounds = BoundingBox(min: [-1, -1, 0], max: [1, 1, 0])
    mesh.parts.replaceAll([
        LowLevelMesh.Part(
            indexCount: 3,
            topology: .triangle,
            bounds: meshBounds
        )
    ])

    return mesh
}
```

To finish, create a MeshResource from the `LowLevelMesh`, and add it to a ModelComponent. You can then add this model to any Entity in your scene:

```
func triangleEntity() throws -> Entity {
    let lowLevelMesh = try triangleMesh()
    let resource = try MeshResource(from: lowLevelMesh)

    let modelComponent = ModelComponent(mesh: resource, materials: [UnlitMaterial()])

    let entity = Entity()
    entity.name = "Triangle"
    entity.components.set(modelComponent)
    entity.scale *= 0.1
    return entity
}
```

The low-level mesh creates a triangular shape in your RealityKit scene:

The MeshResource retains a reference to the `LowLevelMesh`, reflecting any changes when the renderer updates.
