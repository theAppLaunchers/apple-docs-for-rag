## Overview

You can use a `ReferenceComponent` to load other entities from files in your appâ€™s main bundle. This allows you to load complex scenes incrementally, resulting in more responsive apps. It also enables collaborative workflows so you can split a complex scene into separate pieces that different teams own.

Use a `ReferenceComponent` by adding it to an entity when building up a scene programmatically. Then call write(to:) to save the scene to a `.reality` file.

```
// Create the root entity.
let root = Entity()

// Create an entity that references another entity file.
let earth = Entity()
earth.setParent(root)

// Add a reference to another entity that loads immediately
// when the root entity loads.
earth.components.set(ReferenceComponent(
    named: "Earth",
    loadingPolicy: .immediate))

// Add a reference to another entity that loads on demand.
let mars = Entity()
mars.name = "mars"
mars.components.set(ReferenceComponent(
    named: "Mars",
    loadingPolicy: .onDemand))

// Write the root entity to a `.reality` file.
try await root.write(to: fileURL)
```

When your app loads the `.reality` file, it can dynamically load referenced entities from files. For references that have a ReferenceComponent.LoadingPolicy of ReferenceComponent.LoadingPolicy.onDemand, you can use loadReference(at:) to load content on demand.

```
if let entity = root.findEntity(named: "mars") {
    try ReferenceComponent.loadReference(at: entity)
}
```

Conversely, use releaseReference(at:) to unload content and free up memory.

## Topics

### Initializers

init(named: String, at: String, loadingPolicy: ReferenceComponent.LoadingPolicy)

Creates a reference component with a name, loading policy, and bundle path.

init(named: String, in: Bundle, loadingPolicy: ReferenceComponent.LoadingPolicy)

Creates a reference component with a name, loading policy, and bundle.

init(named: String, loadingPolicy: ReferenceComponent.LoadingPolicy)

Creates a reference component with a name and loading policy.

### Instance Properties

var loadingPolicy: ReferenceComponent.LoadingPolicy

A policy that defines when a referenced entity loads.

var reference: Entity?

The root entity of the referenced entity file.

var state: ReferenceComponent.ReferenceState

A variable that indicates the loading state of the referenced entity.

### Type Methods

static func loadReference(at: Entity) async throws

Asynchronously loads another entity file that an entity depends on.

static func loadReference(at: Entity) throws

Synchronously loads another entity file that an entity depends on.

static func releaseReference(at: Entity) throws

Releases the reference an entity holds.

### Enumerations

enum LoadingPolicy

Describes when a referenced entity loads.
