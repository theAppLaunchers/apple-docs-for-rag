# ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.overCapturing

If the `numberOfShotsTaken > maximumNumberOfInputImages` then any additional shots will not be used in an on-device reconstruction and reconstruction is recommended to be done on a Mac that can support a greater number of images.

## Discussion

Note: this will only occur if `isOverCaptureEnabled` was set to true in the `Configuration` used to start the session â€“ otherwise, the session will simply stop capturing once the device limit is reached.
