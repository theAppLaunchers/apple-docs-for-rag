# trimStart

``` source
var trimStart: TimeInterval? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property is `nil` by default, which plays the animation from the starting frame defined by start.

If you set a value for this property, the animation visually begins from an additional seconds offset from the starting frame and decreases the duration by that amount.

If you set a negative value for this property, the duration increases and the additional animation data fills in based on the fillMode you choose.
