## Discussion

This property defines the node that represents the root of a blend tree. If you assign this property a BlendTreeBlendNode instance, the root branches for every member you add to the instanceâ€™s sources property.

If you define a BlendTreeSourceNode instance to this property, the tree contains a single animation, which blends with no other animations.
