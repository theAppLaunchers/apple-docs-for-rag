``` source
var matrix: float4x4 { get set }
```

## Discussion

The Transform component canâ€™t represent all transforms that a general 4x4 matrix can represent. Using a 4x4 matrix to set the transform is therefore a lossy event that might result in certain transformations, like shear, being dropped.
