Initializer

# init(weightNames:frames:name:tweenMode:frameInterval:isAdditive:bindTarget:blendLayer:repeatMode:fillMode:trimStart:trimEnd:trimDuration:offset:delay:speed:)

Creates an animation that blends between a configuration of blend targets.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
init(
    weightNames: [String],
    frames: [Value],
    name: String = "",
    tweenMode: TweenMode = .linear,
    frameInterval: Float = 1.0 / 30.0,
    isAdditive: Bool = false,
    bindTarget: BindTarget? = nil,
    blendLayer: Int32 = 0,
    repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode = .none,
    fillMode: AnimationFillMode = [],
    trimStart: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimEnd: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimDuration: TimeInterval? = nil,
    offset: TimeInterval = 0,
    delay: TimeInterval = 0,
    speed: Float = 1.0
)
```

Available when `Value` is `BlendShapeWeights`.

## Parameters 

`weightNames`  

The names of the weights in the animated blend shape.

`frames`  

The value of the weights to animate.

`name`  

A textual name for the animation.

`tweenMode`  

An option that determines how animation frames transition.

`frameInterval`  

The duration within the animation timeline for each frame in the frames array.

`isAdditive`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation builds on the current state of the target entity or resets the state before running.

`bindTarget`  

A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.

`blendLayer`  

The order in which the framework composites the animation into the view.

`repeatMode`  

An option that determines how the animation repeats.

`fillMode`  

The playback behavior outside of the normal duration.

`trimStart`  

The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation plays.

`trimEnd`  

The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation stops.

`trimDuration`  

An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.

`offset`  

The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.

`delay`  

An amount of time that elapses before the animation plays.

`speed`  

A factor that changes the animation’s rate of playback.
