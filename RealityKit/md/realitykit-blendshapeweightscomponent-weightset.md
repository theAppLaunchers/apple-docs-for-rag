## Discussion

Initialize the `weightSet` variable using the init() function.

The `weightSet` variable has the following limitations as to how it can be set:

- If `weightSet` is assigned to a new BlendShapeWeightsSet, then the new set have the same number of weights and weight names as the current variable. Additionally, make sure the weight names exactly match the current setâ€™s weight names.

- Weight name changes are ignored.

- Setting an incorrect number of weight values are ignored.

- Blend shape name changes are ignored.
