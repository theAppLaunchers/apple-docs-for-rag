# clearcoatRoughness

The degree to which an entityâ€™s clear, shiny coating scatters light to create soft highlights.

var clearcoatRoughness: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.ClearcoatRoughness { get set }

## Discussion

When you enable clearcoat rendering for a material, RealityKit renders the clearcoat as a separate layer just above the surface of the entity. You can specify a clearcoat roughness value for the clearcoat to indicate how much the clearcoat scatters light that bounces off of it, which softens and spreads out the highlights.

You can specify a single value that applies to the entire material, or you can supply a UV-mapped image texture containing different roughness values for different parts of the entity.

The following example sets the `clearcoatRoughness` using a single value:

```
material.clearcoatRoughness = .init(floatLiteral: 0.5)
```

This example shows how to set the `clearcoatRoughness` using a UV-mapped image:

```
if let clearcoatRoughnessResource = try?
TextureResource.load(named: "entity_cc_roughness") {
    let ccRoughnessMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(clearcoatRoughnessResource)
    material.clearcoat = .init(texture: ccRoughnessMap)
}
```
