# AnimationTimingFunction

The pacing of an animation transition.

struct AnimationTimingFunction
```

## Overview

Use an animation timing function to control the pace of an animation transition when you call one of an entityâ€™s animated move methods, like move(to:relativeTo:duration:timingFunction:). If you omit a timing function from the call, the method uses the default timing function.

## Topics

### Creating timing functions

static var `default`: AnimationTimingFunction

A timing function that produces the default curve for the transition.

static var easeIn: AnimationTimingFunction

A timing function that produces a gradual starting transition.

static var easeInOut: AnimationTimingFunction

A timing function that produces a gradual starting and ending transition.

static var easeOut: AnimationTimingFunction

A timing function that produces a gradual ending transition.

static var linear: AnimationTimingFunction

A timing function that produces a linear transition.

static func cubicBezier(controlPoint1: SIMD2&lt;Float>, controlPoint2: SIMD2&lt;Float>) -> AnimationTimingFunction

Creates a timing function that accelerates and then decelerates towards the target value with the cubic bezier shape specified by two control points.

### Comparing timing functions

static func == (AnimationTimingFunction, AnimationTimingFunction) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are not equal.

func hash(into: inout Hasher)

Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.

var hashValue: Int

The hash value.
