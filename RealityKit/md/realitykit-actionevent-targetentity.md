``` source
let targetEntity: Entity?
```

## Discussion

For example, if a bind target references an entityâ€™s transform (i.e. `.transform`), this value is set to that entity.

This may differ from the entity property in the playback controller if the bind target references an entity other than the entity that the animation was played on.
