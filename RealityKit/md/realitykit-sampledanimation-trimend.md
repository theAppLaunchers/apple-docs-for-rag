# trimEnd

The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation stops.

``` source
var trimEnd: TimeInterval? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property is `nil` by default, which plays the animation until the end frame interval. If you set a value, the animation subtracts an additional seconds duration from the animation data that the end frame interval references.
