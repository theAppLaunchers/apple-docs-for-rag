Instance Method

# onVolumeViewpointChange(updateStrategy:initial:\_:)

Adds an action to perform when the viewpoint of the volume changes.

RealityKitSwiftUIvisionOS 2.0+

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
func onVolumeViewpointChange(
    updateStrategy: VolumeViewpointUpdateStrategy = .supported,
    initial: Bool = true,
    _ action: @escaping (Viewpoint3D, Viewpoint3D) -> Void
) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`updateStrategy`  

Whether the action should be run for all viewpoint changes or only for supported viewpoint changes.

`initial`  

Whether the action should be run when this view initially appears.

`action`  

A closure to run when the viewpoint changes. The closure is also run when the volume is first opened.

## Discussion

Use the provided `Viewpoint3D` to update the content of the volume:

```
struct RobotContentView: View {
    @State var robotRotation: Rotation3D = .identity

    var body: some View {
        Model3D(named: "robot")
            .onVolumeViewpointChange { _, newValue in
                robotRotation = Rotation3D.slerp(
                    from: robotRotation,
                    to: newValue.squareAzimuth.orientation,
                    t: 1.0,
                    along: .shortest
                )
            }
            .rotation3DEffect(robotRotation)
            .animation(.easeInOut, value: robotRotation)
    }
}
```

By default, the action will only be run when the new viewpoint is equivalent to one of the values provided through `View/supportedVolumeViewpoints(_:)`. The viewpoint will be equivalent to where the window bar and ornaments are presented for a volume. Providing `.all` for the `updateStrategy` argument will result in the action being called without regard to the supported viewpoints.

To determine if the volume is being viewed from an unsupported viewpoint, provide `.all` for the `updateStrategy` argument and check if the viewpoint is not within the supported viewpoints:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var showingMoveToFrontSign = false
    @State var moveToFrontSignViewpoint: Viewpoint3D = .standard

    let supportedViewpoints = [SquareAzimuth.front]

    var body: some View {
        MoveToFrontSignView(viewpoint: moveToFrontSignViewpoint)
            .opacity(showingMoveToFrontSign ? 1.0 : 0.0)
            .animation(.easeInOut, value: showingMoveToFrontSign)
            .onVolumeViewpointChange(updateStrategy: .all)
                { _, newValue in

                moveToFrontSignViewpoint = newViewpoint

                let isSupported = supportedViewpoints.contains(
                    newViewpoint.squareAzimuth)
                showingMoveToFrontSign = !isSupported
            }
            .supportedVolumeViewpoints(supportedViewpoints)
    }
}
```

The old and new `Viewpoint3D` provided to the action are relative to the center of the volume.

Reading this value is only valid inside a `View` that inherits the environment of a Scene created with a `VolumetricWindowStyle`. This value will be equivalent to `Viewpoint3D/standard` when read within a standard window.
