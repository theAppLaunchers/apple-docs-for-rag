## Overview

Use entity queries to iterate through all entities in a RealityKit scene that meet certain criteria. To specify which entities to retrieve, use a QueryPredicate.

To execute the query, pass it into the sceneâ€™s performQuery(_:) method and then iterate over the results.

```
// Build a query to retrieve all anchor components.
let query = EntityQuery(where: .has(AnchorComponent.self)

// Ask the scene to perform the query and iterate over the returned
entities. scene.performQuery(query).forEach { entity in
    // Make any needed changes to entities.
}
```
