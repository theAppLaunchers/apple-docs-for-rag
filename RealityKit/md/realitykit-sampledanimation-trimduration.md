Instance Property

# trimDuration

An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.

iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+visionOS

``` source
var trimDuration: TimeInterval? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property is `nil` by default, which indicates that the animation stops after one play that spans duration.

If you set a value for this property and both trimStart and trimEnd are `nil`, the animation observes this property as an edited duration.

A value greater than duration causes the animation to repeat, applying the characteristics defined by repeatMode. Assign this property greatestFiniteMagnitude to repeat indefinitely.
