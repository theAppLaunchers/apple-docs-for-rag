func compare(
    _ lhs: Comparator.Compared,
    _ rhs: Comparator.Compared
) -> ComparisonResult where Comparator : SortComparator, Comparator == Self.Element
```

## Discussion

The first element of the sequence of comparators specifies the primary comparator to be used in sorting the sequenceâ€™s elements. Any subsequent comparators are used to further refine the order of elements with equal values.
