Initializer

# init(source:name:bindTarget:blendLayer:repeatMode:fillMode:trimStart:trimEnd:trimDuration:offset:delay:speed:)

Creates a variation of the given animation by overriding its properties.

iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+visionOS

``` source
init(
    source: any AnimationDefinition,
    name: String = "",
    bindTarget: BindTarget? = nil,
    blendLayer: Int32 = 0,
    repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode = .none,
    fillMode: AnimationFillMode = [],
    trimStart: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimEnd: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimDuration: TimeInterval? = nil,
    offset: TimeInterval = 0,
    delay: TimeInterval = 0,
    speed: Float = 1.0
)
```

## Parameters 

`source`  

The original animation that this structure modifies.

`name`  

A textual name for the animation.

`bindTarget`  

A textual name that identifies the animated property.

`blendLayer`  

The order in which the framework visually composites the animation among other running animations.

`repeatMode`  

An option that determines how the animation repeats outside the length of the view.

`fillMode`  

The behavior when the animated property reaches its end value.

`trimStart`  

The optional time, in seconds, at which the source animation plays.

`trimEnd`  

The optional time, in seconds, at which the source animation stops.

`trimDuration`  

An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.

`offset`  

The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.

`delay`  

An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.

`speed`  

A factor that increases or decreases the animation’s playback rate.
