```

## Overview

This allows developers to fine-tune which entities with an `AnchoringComponent` interact with each other physically, as opposed to not interacting at all.

## Topics

### Operators

static func == (AnchoringComponent.PhysicsSimulation, AnchoringComponent.PhysicsSimulation) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

### Enumeration Cases

case isolated

Simulates the entity and its descendants in the entityâ€™s own physics space.

case none

Opts out the entity and its descendants from having their own physics space.

### Instance Properties

var hashValue: Int

The hash value.

### Instance Methods

func hash(into: inout Hasher)

Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.

### Default Implementations

Equatable Implementations

## Relationships

### Conforms To

- Equatable
- Hashable
