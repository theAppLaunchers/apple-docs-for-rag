@MainActor @preconcurrency
class AudioBufferResource
```

## Overview

Use the resource to create an AudioPlaybackController instance by calling an entityâ€™s prepareAudio(_:) or playAudio(_:) function. The controller plays the audio from the location in space of the entity that created the controller.

## Topics

### Deprecated

init(buffer: AVAudioBuffer, inputMode: AudioResource.InputMode, shouldLoop: Bool) throws
