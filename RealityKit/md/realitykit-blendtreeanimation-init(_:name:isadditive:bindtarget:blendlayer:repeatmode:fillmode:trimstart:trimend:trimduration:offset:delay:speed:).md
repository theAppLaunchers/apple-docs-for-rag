Initializer

# init(\_:name:isAdditive:bindTarget:blendLayer:repeatMode:fillMode:trimStart:trimEnd:trimDuration:offset:delay:speed:)

Creates a unique animation from a combination of other animations in the form of a tree.

iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+visionOS

``` source
init(
    _ root: any BlendTreeNode,
    name: String = "",
    isAdditive: Bool = false,
    bindTarget: BindTarget? = nil,
    blendLayer: Int32 = 0,
    repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode = .none,
    fillMode: AnimationFillMode = [],
    trimStart: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimEnd: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimDuration: TimeInterval? = nil,
    offset: TimeInterval = 0,
    delay: TimeInterval = 0,
    speed: Float = 1
)
```

## Parameters 

`root`  

The first node in a tree of animations.

`name`  

A textual name for the animation.

`isAdditive`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation builds on the current state of the target entity or resets the state before running.

`bindTarget`  

A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.

`blendLayer`  

The order in which the framework composites the animation into the view.

`repeatMode`  

An option that determines how the animation repeats.

`fillMode`  

The behavior when the animated property reaches its end value.

`trimStart`  

The optional time, in seconds, at which the source animation plays.

`trimEnd`  

The optional time, in seconds, at which the source animation stops.

`trimDuration`  

An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.

`offset`  

The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.

`delay`  

An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.

`speed`  

A factor that increases or decreases the animationâ€™s rate of playback.
