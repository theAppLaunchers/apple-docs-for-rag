## Discussion

The default value is `0`, which indicates that the animation plays with no offset. Setting a value for this property moves the animation data along the timeline and doesnâ€™t change timing. If you set a `AnimationAction/fillMode` other than none, the animation fills the vacant area created by the offset according to the characteristics of the specified fill mode.
