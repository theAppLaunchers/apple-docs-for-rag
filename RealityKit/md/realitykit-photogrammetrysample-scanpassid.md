Instance Property

# scanPassID

If captured with `ObjectCaptureSession`, this will contain the ID of the scan pass within the given `sessionID` in which this sample was captured. Each new scan pass within a specific `sessionID` will have a different `scanPassID` which can be used to differentiate any associated `boundingBox` data since a new bounding box may have been created after flipping an object and starting a new pass. Note that `scanPassID` can only be equated if the `sessionID` is the same â€“ if the `sessionID` of two samples is different but the `scanPassID` is the same, these are semantically different coordinate systems and data between them is not commensurate. Note that for samples not captured with `ObjectCaptureSession` (where `sessionID` is `nil`), this `scanPassID` is also `nil`.
