``` source
nonisolated
func contextMenu(
    @ViewBuilder menuItems: () -> M,
    @ViewBuilder preview: () -> P
) -> some View where M : View, P : View
```

## Parameters 

`menuItems`  

A closure that produces the menu’s contents. You can deactivate the context menu by returning nothing from the closure.

`preview`  

A view that the system displays along with the menu.

## Return Value

A view that can display a context menu with a preview.

## Discussion

When you use this modifer to add a context menu to a view in your app’s user interface, the system displays the custom preview beside the menu. Compose the menu by returning controls like `Button`, `Toggle`, and `Picker` from the `menuItems` closure. You can also use `Menu` to define submenus or `Section` to group items.

Define the custom preview by returning a view from the `preview` closure. The system sizes the preview to match the size of its content. For example, you can add a two button context menu to a `Text` view, and use an `Image` as the preview:

```
Text("Turtle Rock")
    .padding()
    .contextMenu {
        Button {
            // Add this item to a list of favorites.
        } label: {
            Label("Add to Favorites", systemImage: "heart")
        }
        Button {
            // Open Maps and center it on this item.
        } label: {
            Label("Show in Maps", systemImage: "mappin")
        }
    } preview: {
        Image("turtlerock") // Loads the image from an asset catalog.
    }
```

When someone activates the context menu with an action like touch and hold in iOS or iPadOS, the system displays the image and the menu:

To customize the lift preview, shown while the system transitions to show your custom `preview`, apply a `View/contentShape(_:_:eoFill:)` with a `ContentShapeKinds/contextMenuPreview` kind. For example, you can change the lift preview’s corner radius or use a nested view as the lift preview.

Note

This view modifier produces a context menu on macOS, but that platform doesn’t display the preview.

If you don’t need a preview, use `View/contextMenu(menuItems:)` instead. If you want to add a context menu to a container that supports selection, like a `List` or a `Table`, and you want to distinguish between menu activation on a selection and activation in an empty area of the container, use `View/contextMenu(forSelectionType:menu:primaryAction:)`.
