# Preliminary_ReferenceImage

A schema that defines the properties of an image in the physical environment.

## Overview

This schema defines the criteria that the runtime uses to recognize an image in the physical environment, including pixel data and width.

When RealityKit opens a USDZ file that defines a reference image, it instantiates an AnchorEntity with a component type AnchoringComponent.Target.image(group:name:).

### Declaration

```
class Preliminary_ReferenceImage "Preliminary_ReferenceImage" (
    inherits = 
)
```

### Define a reference image

The following example defines a prim named `ImageReference` that instructs the runtime to scan for an image described by `image.png`.

```
def Preliminary_ReferenceImage "ImageReference"
{
    uniform asset image = @image.png@
    uniform double physicalWidth = 12
}
```
