Type Alias

# CollisionGroup.RawValue

The raw type that can be used to represent all values of the conforming type.

iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.15+visionOS

``` source
typealias RawValue = UInt32
```

## Discussion

Every distinct value of the conforming type has a corresponding unique value of the `RawValue` type, but there may be values of the `RawValue` type that donâ€™t have a corresponding value of the conforming type.

static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are not equal.

typealias Element

var isEmpty: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the set has no elements.

let rawValue: UInt32

func formSymmetricDifference(Self)

Replaces this set with a new set containing all elements contained in either this set or the given set, but not in both.

func formUnion(Self)

Inserts the elements of another set into this option set.

func insert(Self.Element) -> (inserted: Bool, memberAfterInsert: Self.Element)

Adds the given element to the option set if it is not already a member.
