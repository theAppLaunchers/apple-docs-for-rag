# ProjectiveTransformCameraComponent

A component that defines a virtual camera with a custom projection matrix.

```

## Overview

Each scene requires a camera, which defines the viewpoint from which RealityKit renders the scene. The projective transform camera renders the entities in the scene based on a custom user defined matrix. To create a projective transform camera, add this component to an entity.

```
// Create an entity to hold the camera component.
let cameraEntity = Entity()

// Create a projective transform camera component with a custom matrix.
var projectiveCameraComponent = ProjectiveTransformCameraComponent(projectionMatrix: customMatrix)

// Add it to the camera entity.
cameraEntity.components.set(projectiveCameraComponent)

// Set the entity's position and orientation to look at the subject.
let cameraPosition: SIMD3 = [0, 1, 3]

// The subject in this case is the origin.
let target: SIMD3 = .zero
cameraEntity.look(at: target, from: cameraPosition, relativeTo: nil)

// Add the camera entity to your scene.
content.add(cameraEntity)
```
