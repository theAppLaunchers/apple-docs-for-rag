# AnimationRepeatMode.repeat

A mode that restarts the animation after it completes.

``` source
case `repeat`
```

## Discussion

This mode restores the animated property to its initial value each time it restarts. For example, a FromToByAnimation with fromValue `=` `1.0`, toValue `=` `2.0` and repeatMode set to this property repeats as, `1.0`, `2.0`, `1.0`, `2.0`, `1.0`, `2.0` and so on.
