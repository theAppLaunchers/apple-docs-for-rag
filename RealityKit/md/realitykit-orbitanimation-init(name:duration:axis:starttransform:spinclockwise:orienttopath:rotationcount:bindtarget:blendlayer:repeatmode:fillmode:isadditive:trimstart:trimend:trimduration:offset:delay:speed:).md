Initializer

# init(name:duration:axis:startTransform:spinClockwise:orientToPath:rotationCount:bindTarget:blendLayer:repeatMode:fillMode:isAdditive:trimStart:trimEnd:trimDuration:offset:delay:speed:)

Creates an animation that revolves an entity around its origin.

``` source
init(
    name: String = "",
    duration: TimeInterval = 1.0,
    axis: SIMD3 = .init(x: 0.0, y: 1.0, z: 0.0),
    startTransform: Transform = .identity,
    spinClockwise: Bool = true,
    orientToPath: Bool = false,
    rotationCount: Float = 1.0,
    bindTarget: BindTarget? = nil,
    blendLayer: Int32 = 0,
    repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode = .none,
    fillMode: AnimationFillMode = [],
    isAdditive: Bool = false,
    trimStart: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimEnd: TimeInterval? = nil,

    speed: Float = 1
)
```

## Parameters 

`name`  

A textual name for the animation.

`duration`  

The elapsed time for one complete rotation.

`axis`  

A 3D vector that points in the direction of the axis around which to rotate.

`startTransform`  

The orbiting entity’s beginning position.

`spinClockwise`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the object orbits the center point in the clockwise direction.

`orientToPath`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the orbiting object updates its orientation during the animation to orient itself along the rotation path.

`rotationCount`  

The number of times to rotate the target entity before stopping.

`bindTarget`  

A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.

`blendLayer`  

The order in which the framework composites the animation into the view.

`repeatMode`  

An option that determines how the animation repeats.

`fillMode`  

The playback behavior outside of the normal duration.

`isAdditive`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation builds on the current state of the target entity or resets the state before running.

`trimStart`  

The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation plays.

`trimEnd`  

The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation stops.

`trimDuration`  

An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.

`offset`  

The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.

`delay`  

An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.

`speed`  

A factor that changes the animation’s rate of playback.
