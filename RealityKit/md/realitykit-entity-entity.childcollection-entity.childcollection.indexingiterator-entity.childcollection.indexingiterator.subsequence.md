### Splitting and joining entities

func split(maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool, whereSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [ArraySlice&lt;Self.Element>]

Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, that donâ€™t contain elements satisfying the given predicate. Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.

func split(separator: Self.Element, maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool) -> [ArraySlice&lt;Self.Element>]

Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, around elements equal to the given element.

func joined() -> FlattenSequence&lt;Self>

Returns the elements of this sequence of sequences, concatenated.

func joined&lt;Separator>(separator: Separator) -> JoinedSequence&lt;Self>

Returns the concatenated elements of this sequence of sequences, inserting the given separator between each element.

func joined(separator: String) -> String

Returns a new string by concatenating the elements of the sequence, adding the given separator between each element.
