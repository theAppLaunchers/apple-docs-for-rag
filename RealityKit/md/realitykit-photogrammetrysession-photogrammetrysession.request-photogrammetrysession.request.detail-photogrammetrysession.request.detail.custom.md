A custom quality for the model, with specifics defined by the photogrammetry session.

Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOS 14.0+

``` source
case custom
```

## Discussion

If you select `.custom`, you can define unique detail parameters by configuring the session with a PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.CustomDetailSpecification instance in a customDetailSpecification. The configuration lets you precisely control the modelâ€™s detail level, processing efficiency, and output file size by adjusting properties such as maximumPolygonCount, textureFormat, and more.

Note

customDetailSpecification will be applied to every PhotogrammetrySession.Request that specifies a `.custom` detail in this session. It has no effect on the other levels.
