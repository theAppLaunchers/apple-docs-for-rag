iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
init(
    blendShapeName: String,
    weightNames: [String]
)
```

## Parameters 

`blendShapeName`  

The user-defined name of the blend shape.

`weightNames`  

The names of the weights that are managed by this mapping.

## Discussion

This creates a mapping that applies the weight names to every mesh part in the ModelComponent associated with the BlendShapeWeightsComponentâ€™s entity.

Make sure the weight names match the weight names in the mesh resource data. RealityKit will ignore weight names that do not match.
