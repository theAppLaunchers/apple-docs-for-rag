## Topics

### Creating a vertex attribute

init(semantic: LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic, format: MTLVertexFormat, layoutIndex: Int, offset: Int)

Creates an attribute for a low-level mesh.

### Describing an attribute

var format: MTLVertexFormat

The format of the vertex attribute.

var offset: Int

The location of an attribute in vertex data, determined by the byte offset from the start of the vertex data.

var layoutIndex: Int

The index of the layout that contains this attribute.

var semantic: LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic

The semantic of the vertex attribute, which describes how you want RealityKit to interpret the attribute.
