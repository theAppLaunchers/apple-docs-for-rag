Type Method

# generateStaticMesh(from:)

Creates a mesh-based collision shape derived from an ARKit scene-understanding mesh anchor.

``` source
nonisolated
static func generateStaticMesh(from meshAnchor: MeshAnchor) async throws -> ShapeResource
```

## Parameters 

`meshAnchor`  

The mesh anchor that defines the collision shape. This anchor needs to have `meshAnchor.geometry.faces.primitive == GeometryElement.Primitive.triangle`.

## Discussion

The returned `ShapeResource` can only be used under the following circumstances:

- This shape can only be used with `PhysicsBodyMode.static` (not `.dynamic` or `.kinematic`)

- This shape cannot be used with `CollisionComponent.Mode.trigger`

In other words, the returned shape can only be used for static world geometry.

Note

Generating a shape resource from the AR mesh takes time, because the input mesh needs to be preprocessed (“cooked”) by the physics engine before it can be used. This function is marked `async` because ideally this precomputation should occur in the background. For example, when calling from non-`async` code, you can use Swift’s `Task` API to assign a priority (see the example below).

Below is example usage of this function, assumed to be called from a non-async block:

```
let myAnchor: MeshAnchor = ...
// It is recommended to use a low-priority task, since generating the collision mesh can take a while.
let myShapeTask = Task(priority: .low) {
    let shape = await ShapeResource.generateStaticMesh(from: myAnchor)

    // Now we can do something with `shape`, such as create an entity with it.
    // Make sure to call non-async RealityKit methods from the main actor:
    await MainActor.run {
        let entity = Entity()
        entity.components[CollisionComponent.self] = .init(shapes: [shape])

        // Note that `mode` can not be set to `.dynamic`.  Only `.static` is supported.
        entity.components[PhysicsBodyComponent.self] = .init(massProperties: .default,
                                                             material: nil,
                                                             mode: .static)
        // ...
    }
}
```
