## Overview

Note

This sample code project is associated with WWDC24 session 10104: Build a spatial drawing app with RealityKit.

### Configure the sample code project

To run this sample code, you’ll need:

- An Apple Vision Pro with visionOS 2 or later

- Xcode 16 or later

Because this sample app uses ARKit hand tracking on visionOS, drawing features aren’t available in the visionOS simulator.
