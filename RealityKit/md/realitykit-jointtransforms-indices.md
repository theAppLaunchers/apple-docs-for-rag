``` source
var indices: DefaultIndices { get }
```

Available when `Indices` is `DefaultIndices`.

## Discussion

A collectionâ€™s `indices` property can hold a strong reference to the collection itself, causing the collection to be non-uniquely referenced. If you mutate the collection while iterating over its indices, a strong reference can cause an unexpected copy of the collection. To avoid the unexpected copy, use the `index(after:)` method starting with `startIndex` to produce indices instead.

```
var c = MyFancyCollection([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
var i = c.startIndex
while i != c.endIndex {
    c[i] /= 5
    i = c.index(after: i)
}
// c == MyFancyCollection([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
```
