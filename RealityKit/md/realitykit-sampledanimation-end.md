## Discussion

When calculating the visual beginning of a sampled animation, the framework first evaluates this property, and then applies the optional trimEnd, in seconds.

The framework requires this property to contain an integer multiple of frameInterval. Note that the value of this property can be irrational because frame interval is of type TimeInterval.

var offset: TimeInterval

The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.

func trimmed(start: TimeInterval?, end: TimeInterval?, duration: TimeInterval?) -> Self
