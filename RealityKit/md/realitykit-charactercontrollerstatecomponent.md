``` source
struct CharacterControllerStateComponent
```

## Overview

RealityKit adds this component to an entity when you add a CharacterControllerComponent instance to it. Manually adding this component to an entity that has a character controller component has no effect because itâ€™s redundant.

## Topics

### Creating a state component

init()

### Accessing character controller state

let isOnGround: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the character controller is on the ground.

let velocity: SIMD3&lt;Float>

The linear speed relative to the origin in physics space.
