static let predicted: AnchoringComponent.TrackingMode
```

## Discussion

`predicted` means the `Entity` will be updated whenever the corresponding anchor is updated but its transformation will be `ARKit` prediction.

If the target does not support prediction, `predicted` behaves the same as `continuous`.
