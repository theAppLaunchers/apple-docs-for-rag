iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.15+visionOS

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
func didClone(from source: Entity)
```

## Parameters 

`source`  

The entity from which the cloned entity was copied.

## Discussion

This method clones all component data automatically. When you clone an entity that stores custom data thatâ€™s not part of a component, override the didClone(from:) method to copy that data manually after the clone finishes.
