## Discussion

An exponent that determines how the effectâ€™s strength diminishes over time. Use a non-negative rate.

- When the rate is **0**, no falloff occurs.

- When the rate is **greater than 0 and less than 1.0**, falloff occurs slower and is sublinear.

- When the rate is **1.0**, falloff is linear.

- When the rate is **greater than 1**, falloff occurs faster and is nonlinear.
