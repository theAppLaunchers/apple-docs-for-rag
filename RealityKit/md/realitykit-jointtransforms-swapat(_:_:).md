Instance Method

# swapAt(\_:\_:)

Exchanges the values at the specified indices of the collection.

``` source
mutating func swapAt(
    _ i: Self.Index,
    _ j: Self.Index
)
```

## Parameters 

`i`  

The index of the first value to swap.

`j`  

The index of the second value to swap.

## Discussion

Both parameters must be valid indices of the collection that are not equal to `endIndex`. Calling `swapAt(_:_:)` with the same index as both `i` and `j` has no effect.

Complexity

O(1)

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.

func enumerated() -> EnumeratedSequence&lt;Self>

Returns a sequence of pairs (*n*, *x*), where *n* represents a consecutive integer starting at zero and *x* represents an element of the sequence.

func filter((Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.Element]

Returns an array containing, in order, the elements of the sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
