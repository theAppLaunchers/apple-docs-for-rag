## Discussion

This node combines the animations of each member of this array to a single animation that represents a *blend* of the sources. If a source is a BlendTreeSourceNode, this structure blends its animation into the output. If a source is a BlendTreeBlendNode, this structure blends the output of its sources into this structureâ€™s output.
