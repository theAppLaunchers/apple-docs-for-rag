``` source
func joined() -> FlattenSequence
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `Sequence`.

## Return Value

A flattened view of the elements of this sequence of sequences.

## Discussion

In this example, an array of three ranges is flattened so that the elements of each range can be iterated in turn.

```
let ranges = [0..

### Splitting and joining entities

func split(maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool, whereSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [ArraySlice&lt;Self.Element>]

Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, that don’t contain elements satisfying the given predicate. Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.

func split(separator: Self.Element, maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool) -> [ArraySlice&lt;Self.Element>]

Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, around elements equal to the given element.

func joined&lt;Separator>(separator: Separator) -> JoinedSequence&lt;Self>

Returns the concatenated elements of this sequence of sequences, inserting the given separator between each element.

func joined(separator: String) -> String

Returns a new string by concatenating the elements of the sequence, adding the given separator between each element.
