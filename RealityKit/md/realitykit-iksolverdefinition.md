# IKSolverDefinition

A container describing a solver instance.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
struct IKSolverDefinition
```

## Overview

Adds unique identifier for each solver instance as the rig can be reused.

## Topics

### Initializers

init(id: IKSolverDefinition.ID, rig: IKRig)

Creates a solver definition for with a unique solver identifier and a rig.

### Instance Properties

let id: IKSolverDefinition.ID

The identifier of the solver instance.

var rigDefinition: IKRig

The solverâ€™s rig definition.

### Type Aliases

typealias ID

A type representing the stable identity of the entity associated with an instance.
