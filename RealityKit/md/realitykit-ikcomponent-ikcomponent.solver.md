# IKComponent.Solver

The update stage object that lets you read and update the current settings of a single solver instance.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
class Solver
```

## Overview

The settings this object exposes are the runtime editable values on the solver instance itself, the solver joints and constraints. For the full list of settings adjustable during creation, see IKRig.

## Topics

### Structures

struct ID

The solver instance identifier type.

### Instance Properties

var constraints: IKComponent.ConstraintCollection

The collection of all of the constraint update stage objects of the solver instance.

var globalFkWeight: Float

The solver global forward kinematics demandâ€™s weight.

var id: IKComponent.Solver.ID

The solver instance identifier.

var joints: IKComponent.JointCollection

The collection of all of the joint update stage objects of the solver instance.

var maxIterations: Int

The maximum number of iterations the solver is allowed to do per frame.

### Instance Methods

func reset()

Enqueues a solver reset call that executes before the next solve.
