``` source
nonisolated
func buttonRepeatBehavior(_ behavior: ButtonRepeatBehavior) -> some View
```

## Parameters 

`behavior`  

A value of `enabled` means that buttons should enable repeating behavior and a value of `disabled` means that buttons should disallow repeating behavior.

## Discussion

Apply this to buttons that increment or decrement a value or perform some other inherently iterative operation. Interactions such as pressing-and-holding on the button, holding the buttonâ€™s keyboard shortcut, or holding down the space key while the button is focused will trigger this repeat behavior.

```
Button {
    playbackSpeed.advance(by: 1)
} label: {
    Label("Speed up", systemImage: "hare")
}
.buttonRepeatBehavior(.enabled)
```

This affects all system button styles, as well as automatically affects custom `ButtonStyle` conforming types. This does not automatically apply to custom `PrimitiveButtonStyle` conforming types, and the `EnvironmentValues.buttonRepeatBehavior` value should be used to adjust their custom gestures as appropriate.
