## Discussion

This defines both how large the canvas is for text layout, as well as how large it is in world-space. The canvas coordinate system uses the standard CoreGraphics / CoreText coordinate space. There is no explicit backing-buffer size, as it might be dynamic to generate high-fidelity text. The canvas size uses points as 1/72nd of an inch (about 0.352 mm) in world-space. World-size might change as a function of any peer or parent transform component.

This component lays out text using default `AttributedString` behaviors, but respecting the `edgeInsets` property. Text will wrap-around, rather than truncate. It will stay at the given fixed font size, and will not stretch or scale to fit. CoreText can determine the required canvas size for a particular string or layout. The canvas size is clamped to a maximum of 2048 points in width and height.
