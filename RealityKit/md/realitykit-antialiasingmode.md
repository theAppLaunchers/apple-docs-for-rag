# AntialiasingMode

The rendering technique used to smooth edges of virtual content.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+visionOS 2.0+

``` source
enum AntialiasingMode
```

## Topics

### Setting the antialiasing mode

case multisample4X

Multisampling renders each pixel multiple times and combines the results, creating a higher quality image at a performance cost proportional to the number of samples used.

case none

Do not apply any technique to smooth jagged edges.

### Protocol support

func hash(into: inout Hasher)

Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.

var hashValue: Int

The hash value.

static func == (AntialiasingMode, AntialiasingMode) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
