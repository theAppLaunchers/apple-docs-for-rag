Instance Method

# index(\_:offsetBy:limitedBy:)

Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.

``` source
func index(
    _ i: Self.Index,
    offsetBy distance: Int,
    limitedBy limit: Self.Index
) -> Self.Index?
```

## Parameters 

`i`  

A valid index of the collection.

`distance`  

The distance to offset `i`. `distance` must not be negative unless the collection conforms to the `BidirectionalCollection` protocol.

`limit`  

A valid index of the collection to use as a limit. If `distance > 0`, a limit that is less than `i` has no effect. Likewise, if `distance 

## Return Value

An index offset by `distance` from the index `i`, unless that index would be beyond `limit` in the direction of movement. In that case, the method returns `nil`.

## Discussion

The following example obtains an index advanced four positions from a string’s starting index and then prints the character at that position. The operation doesn’t require going beyond the limiting `s.endIndex` value, so it succeeds.

```
let s = "Swift"
if let i = s.index(s.startIndex, offsetBy: 4, limitedBy: s.endIndex) {
    print(s[i])
}
// Prints "t"
```

The next example attempts to retrieve an index six positions from `s.startIndex` but fails, because that distance is beyond the index passed as `limit`.

```
let j = s.index(s.startIndex, offsetBy: 6, limitedBy: s.endIndex)
print(j)
// Prints "nil"
```

The value passed as `distance` must not offset `i` beyond the bounds of the collection, unless the index passed as `limit` prevents offsetting beyond those bounds.

Complexity

O(1) if the collection conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`; otherwise, O(*k*), where *k* is the absolute value of `distance`.

### Manipulating indices

func distance(from: Self.Index, to: Self.Index) -> Int

Returns the distance between two indices.

var indices: DefaultIndices&lt;Self>

The indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.

var startIndex: Int

The position of the first element in a nonempty collection. (See `Collection.startIndex`.)

var endIndex: Int

TThe collection’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument. (See `Collection.endIndex`.)

func firstIndex(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?

Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.

func firstIndex(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index?

Returns the first index in which an element of the collection satisfies the given predicate.

func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int)

Offsets the given index by the specified distance.

func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool

Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.

func formIndex(after: inout Self.Index)

Replaces the given index with its successor.

func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int) -> Self.Index

Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index.

func index(after: Int) -> Int

Returns the position immediately after the given index. (See `Collection.index`.)

func index(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?

Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
