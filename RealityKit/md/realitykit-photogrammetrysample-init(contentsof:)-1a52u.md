Initializer

# init(contentsOf:)

Asynchronously loads the image file located at URL into a `PhotogrammetrySample` with as many data fields populated as can be found in the target file. HEIC images captured with the `ObjectCaptureSession` will contain more advanced data fields beyond just the image. Which properties are populated depends on how the images were captured. The `id` of the sample will be automatically created to be unique to the current process. Throws: If `url` does not point to a file URL or there is a problem loading `url`.

``` source
init(contentsOf url: URL) async throws
```

## Discussion

This function is useful for making a capture image inspector or other system that needs to operate in an asynchronous context, such as operating within the main actor.

For example:

```
func loadDepthData(contentsOf url: URL) async -> CVPixelBuffer? {
   return try? await PhotogrammetrySample(contentsOf: url).depthDataMap
}
```
