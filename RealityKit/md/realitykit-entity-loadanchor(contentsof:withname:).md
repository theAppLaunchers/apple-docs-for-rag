```

## Parameters 

`url`

## Discussion

Loading an Entity with this method blocks the main actor because itâ€™s synchronous, so only call it from a command-line application. The method can stall a regular app, which makes it visibly hitch, and the system terminates an app if its UI becomes unresponsive. See init(named:in:) for an example that demonstrates how to safely load content.
