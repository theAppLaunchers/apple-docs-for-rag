## Discussion

If an entityâ€™s ownershipTransferMode property is set to SynchronizationComponent.OwnershipTransferMode.autoAccept, the entity automatically grants ownership to any other entity that requests it.

In case you configure an entity to have a transfer mode of SynchronizationComponent.OwnershipTransferMode.manual, then when you receive an SynchronizationEvents.OwnershipRequest event, call the accept method to complete the transfer of ownership.
