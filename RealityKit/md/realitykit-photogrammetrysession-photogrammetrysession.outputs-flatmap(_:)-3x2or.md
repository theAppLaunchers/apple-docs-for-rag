Instance Method

# flatMap(\_:)

Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given error-throwing transformation with each element of this sequence.

``` source
@preconcurrency
func flatMap(_ transform: @escaping (Self.Element) async throws -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncThrowingFlatMapSequence where SegmentOfResult : AsyncSequence
```

## Parameters 

`transform`  

An error-throwing mapping closure. `transform` accepts an element of this sequence as its parameter and returns an `AsyncSequence`. If `transform` throws an error, the sequence ends.

## Return Value

A single, flattened asynchronous sequence that contains all elements in all the asynchronous sequences produced by `transform`. The sequence ends either when the last sequence created from the last element from base sequence ends, or when `transform` throws an error.

## Discussion

Use this method to receive a single-level asynchronous sequence when your transformation produces an asynchronous sequence for each element.

In this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `5`. The transforming closure takes the received `Int` and returns a new `Counter` that counts that high. For example, when the transform receives `3` from the base sequence, it creates a new `Counter` that produces the values `1`, `2`, and `3`. The `flatMap(_:)` method “flattens” the resulting sequence-of-sequences into a single `AsyncSequence`. However, when the closure receives `4`, it throws an error, terminating the sequence.

```
do {
    let stream = Counter(howHigh: 5)
        .flatMap { (value) -> Counter in
            if value == 4 {
                throw MyError()
            }
            return Counter(howHigh: value)
        }
    for try await number in stream {
        print(number, terminator: " ")
    }
} catch {
    print(error)
}
// Prints "1 1 2 1 2 3 MyError() "
```
