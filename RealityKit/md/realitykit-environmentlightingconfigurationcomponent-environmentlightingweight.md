## Discussion

The weight is a floating-point value in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`.

- A value of `1.0` indicates the entity receives the full environment-lighting contribution.

- A value of `0.0` indicates the entity receives no light from its environment. The entity still receives lighting from other sources, such as directional, point, and spot lights.

- The default value is `1.0`.
