## Overview

A fixed joint connects two GeometricPin instances, pin0 and pin1, so that their poses coincide.

There are zero degrees of rotational or linear freedom between the two pins.

## Topics

### Operators

static func == (PhysicsFixedJoint, PhysicsFixedJoint) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

### Initializers

init(pin0: GeometricPin, pin1: GeometricPin)

Creates a new fixed joint.

### Instance Properties

let checksForInternalCollisions: Bool

A Boolean that indicates whether the joint checks and reports collisions between the two entity instances.

var isActive: Bool

A Boolean that indicates whether the joint is active.

var pin0: GeometricPin

The pin that defines a local position and orientation on the first entity.

var pin1: GeometricPin

The pin that defines a local position and orientation on the second entity.
