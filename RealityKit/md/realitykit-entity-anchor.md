## Discussion

This property returns `nil` if no ancestor can act as an anchor. An entity can act as an anchor if it adopts the HasAnchoring protocol. Just because an ancestor can be anchored doesnâ€™t mean that it is. Inspect the isAnchored property to see if an entity (or one of its ancestors) is anchored.
