## Discussion

The default value is `0`, which indicates that the animation plays with no delay. If you set a value for this property, the animation plays from its start time after the specified delay lapses.

During the delayed time, the animation doesnâ€™t update. However, to fill the delayed time with some portion of animation, set a negative `AnimationAction/trimStart` instead and choose a `AnimationAction/fillMode` that displays the desired portion of animation.
