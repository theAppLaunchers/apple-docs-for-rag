Instance Method

# prefix(\_:)

Returns an asynchronous sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the base asynchronous sequence.

``` source
func prefix(_ count: Int) -> AsyncPrefixSequence
```

## Parameters 

`count`  

The maximum number of elements to return. The value of `count` must be greater than or equal to zero.

## Return Value

An asynchronous sequence starting at the beginning of the base sequence with at most `count` elements.

## Discussion

Use `prefix(_:)` to reduce the number of elements produced by the asynchronous sequence.

In this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `10`. The `prefix(_:)` method causes the modified sequence to pass through the first six values, then end.

```
for await number in Counter(howHigh: 10).prefix(6) {
    print(number, terminator: " ")
}
// Prints "1 2 3 4 5 6 "
```

If the count passed to `prefix(_:)` exceeds the number of elements in the base sequence, the result contains all of the elements in the sequence.

### Filtering the output

func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfy the given predicate.

func compactMap&lt;ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncThrowingCompactMapSequence&lt;Self, ElementOfResult>

Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.

func compactMap&lt;ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncCompactMapSequence&lt;Self, ElementOfResult>

Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.

func contains(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.

func drop(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncDropWhileSequence&lt;Self>

Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.

func dropFirst(Int) -> AsyncDropFirstSequence&lt;Self>

Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.

func filter((Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncFilterSequence&lt;Self>

Creates an asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.

func first(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?

Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.

func flatMap&lt;SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncThrowingFlatMapSequence&lt;Self, SegmentOfResult>

Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given error-throwing transformation with each element of this sequence.

func map&lt;Transformed>((Self.Element) async throws -> Transformed) -> AsyncThrowingMapSequence&lt;Self, Transformed>

Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given error-throwing closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.

func map&lt;Transformed>((Self.Element) async -> Transformed) -> AsyncMapSequence&lt;Self, Transformed>

Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.

func prefix(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) rethrows -> AsyncPrefixWhileSequence&lt;Self>

Returns an asynchronous sequence, containing the initial, consecutive elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
