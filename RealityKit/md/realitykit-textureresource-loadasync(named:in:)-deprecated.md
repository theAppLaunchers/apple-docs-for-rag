``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
static func loadAsync(
    named name: String,
    in bundle: Bundle? = nil
) -> LoadRequest
```

## Parameters 

`name`  

The name of the resource. The filename extension is optional.

`bundle`  

The bundle to search for the resource. Use `nil` to indicate the app’s bundle.

## Return Value

A load operation that publishes the resource.

## Discussion

RealityKit automatically creates a resource name for the texture resource based on the values of `name` and `bundle`. RealityKit uses the resource name to identify resources, and to match texture resources between networked peers. Specify a unique name for each texture resource you load or generate.

See init(named:in:) for an example of optimally loading textures with other content.
