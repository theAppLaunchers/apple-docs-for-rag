# DockingRegionComponent

A component that docks a scene within a region of an immersive space.

``` source
struct DockingRegionComponent
```

## Overview

A docking-region component establishes a fixed area within an immersive environment that an AVPlayerViewController window scene anchors to, which prevents a person from moving the window with a pinch-and-drag gesture.

To anchor dockable scenes, attach a `DockingRegionComponent` to an entity. The entityâ€™s position represents the docking position. Specify the width to set the docking boundary; the docking region maintains a cinematic `2.4:1` width/height ratio, ideal for wide display formats.

The following code is an example of a basic setup for a `DockingRegionComponent`:

```
// Create an entity.
let entity = Entity()

// Create a docking-region component.
var dockingRegionComponent = DockingRegionComponent()

// Set entity's position as the docking position, in meters.
entity.position = [0, 10, -65]

// Set the width of the docking boundary to 75 meters.
dockingRegionComponent.width = 75

// Attach the docking-region component to the entity.
entity.components.set(dockingRegionComponent)
```
