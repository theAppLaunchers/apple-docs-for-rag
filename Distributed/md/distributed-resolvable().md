The attached to type must be a protocol that refines the `DistributedActor` protocol. It must either specify a concrete `ActorSystem` or constrain it in such way that the systemâ€™s `SerializationRequirement` is statically known.

Common protocol to which all distributed actors conform implicitly.

protocol DistributedActorSystem

A distributed actor system underpins and implements all functionality of distributed actors.
