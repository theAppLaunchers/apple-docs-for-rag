## Discussion

Since this method is not distributed, it can only be invoked when the underlying distributed actor is known to be local, e.g. from a context that is isolated to this actor.

Such reference can be used to work with APIs accepting `isolated any Actor`, as only a local distributed actor can be isolated on and may be automatically erased to such `any Actor` when calling methods implicitly accepting the callerâ€™s actor isolation, e.g. by using the `#isolation` macro.
