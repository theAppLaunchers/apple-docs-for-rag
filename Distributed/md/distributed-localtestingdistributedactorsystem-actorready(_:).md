``` source
final func actorReady(_ actor: Act) where Act : DistributedActor, Act.ID == LocalTestingActorID
```

## Parameters 

`actor`  

Reference to the (local) actor that was just fully initialized.

## Discussion

The system is expected to store the reference to this actor, and maintain an `ActorID: DistributedActor` mapping for the purpose of implementing the `resolve(id:as:)` method.

The system usually should NOT retain the passed reference, and it will be informed via resignID(_:) when the actor has been deallocated so it can remove the stale reference from its internal `ActorID: DistributedActor` mapping.

The id of the passed actor must be an LocalTestingDistributedActorSystem.ActorID that this system previously has assigned.

If `actorReady` gets called with some unknown ID, it should crash immediately as it signifies some very unexpected use of the system.
