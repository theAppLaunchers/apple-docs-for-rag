# remoteCall(on:target:invocation:throwing:returning:)

Invoked by the Swift runtime when making a remote call.

``` source
final func remoteCall(
    on actor: Act,
    target: RemoteCallTarget,
    invocation: inout LocalTestingDistributedActorSystem.InvocationEncoder,
    throwing errorType: Err.Type,
    returning returnType: Res.Type
) async throws -> Res where Act : DistributedActor, Err : Error, Res : Decodable, Res : Encodable, Act.ID == LocalTestingActorID
```

## Discussion

The `arguments` are the arguments container that was previously created by `makeInvocationEncoder` and has been populated with all arguments.

This method should perform the actual remote function call, and await for its response.

## Serialization Requirement

Implementations of this method must ensure that the `Argument` type parameter conforms to the typesâ€™ `SerializationRequirement`.

## Errors

This method is allowed to throw because of underlying transport or serialization errors, as well as by re-throwing the error received from the remote callee (if able to).
