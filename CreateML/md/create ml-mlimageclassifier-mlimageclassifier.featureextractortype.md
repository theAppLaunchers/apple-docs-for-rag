``` source
enum FeatureExtractorType
```

## Overview

Create ML has one built-in feature extractor: `scenePrint`. Alternatively, you can provide your own custom feature extractor from an `.mlmodel` file or a specific layer within a model file.

## Topics

### Selecting a feature extractor type

case scenePrint(revision: Int?)

A feature extractor trained on millions of images.

case custom(MLImageClassifier.CustomFeatureExtractor)

A feature extractor that you provide as a Core ML model file or a layer within that file.

struct CustomFeatureExtractor

A custom feature extractor a training session uses to train an image classifier.

### Describing a feature extractor type

var description: String

A text representation of the feature extractor.

var debugDescription: String

A text representation of the feature extractor thatâ€™s suitable for output during debugging.

var playgroundDescription: Any

A description of the feature extractor shown in a playground.
