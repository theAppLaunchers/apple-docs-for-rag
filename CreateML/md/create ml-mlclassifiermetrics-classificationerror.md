## Discussion

The classification error describes how many examples were incorrectly labeled divided by the total number of examples. Accuracy as a percentage may be more intuitive. You can calculate it as follows:

```
let accuracy = (1 - metrics.classificationError) * 100
```

Important

This is a useful metric only when the data is well-balanced between categories. For example, suppose you build a classifier to detect a rare disease with very few examples of sick patients compared to the number of healthy patients. Predicting that a new patient will always be healthy would be highly accurate (low classification error), but a poor disease detector. The precisionRecall and confusion properties provide more detail in these cases.
