case transferLearning(MLObjectDetector.ModelParameters.FeatureExtractorType)
```

## Discussion

You typically use this transfer-learning algorithm to train an object detector in these situations:

- Your training dataset has a limited number of examples. - You prefer your object detectorâ€™s Core ML model file to be as small as possible.
