``` source
func prefix(through position: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
```

## Parameters 

`position`  

The index of the last element to include in the resulting subsequence. `position` must be a valid index of the collection that is not equal to the `endIndex` property.

## Return Value

A subsequence up to, and including, the given position.

## Discussion

The resulting subsequence *includes* the element at the position specified by the `through` parameter. The following example searches for the index of the number `40` in an array of integers, and then prints the prefix of the array up to, and including, that index:

```
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
if let i = numbers.firstIndex(of: 40) {
    print(numbers.prefix(through: i))
}
// Prints "[10, 20, 30, 40]"
```

Using the `prefix(through:)` method is equivalent to using a partial closed range as the collectionâ€™s subscript. The subscript notation is preferred over `prefix(through:)`.

```
if let i = numbers.firstIndex(of: 40) {
    print(numbers[...i])
}
// Prints "[10, 20, 30, 40]"
```

Complexity
