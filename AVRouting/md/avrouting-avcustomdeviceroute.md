## Overview

Use the value of a routeâ€™s networkEndpoint or bluetoothIdentifier property to establish a connection to a device. Typically, only one of the properties provides a valid value, depending on the type of device. In certain cases, both properties may provide valid values, in which case your app determines which one to use.

## Topics
