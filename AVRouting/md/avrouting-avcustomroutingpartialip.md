iOS 16.1+iPadOS 16.1+Mac Catalyst 16.1+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
class AVCustomRoutingPartialIP
```

## Overview

Use this type to define the IP address and subnet mask of known routes on a local network. Create an instance of this class and add it to a custom routing controllerâ€™s knownRouteIPs array like shown below:

```
// Define the IP address.
let anIPAddressInBytes:[UInt8] = [192, 168, 10, 5]
let address = Data(bytes: anIPAddressInBytes, count: anIPAddressInBytes.count)

// Define the subnet mask.
let aMaskInBytes:[UInt8] = [255, 255, 255, 255]
let mask = Data(bytes: aMaskInBytes, count: aMaskInBytes.count)

// Create a new object to represent the address and mask.
let partialIP = AVCustomRoutingPartialIP(address: address, mask: mask)

// Add the instance to the custom routing controller's known routes.
routingController.knownRouteIPs.append(partialIP)
```
