The window that contains the controls to configure the screen saver.

``` source

var configureSheet: NSWindow? { get }
```

## Discussion

The system runs this window as a sheet, so include buttons that allow the user to end the modal session in which the sheet runs. When the user dismisses the sheet, the controller in charge of the sheet must end the document modal session by calling the NSApplication method endSheet(_:) with the sheetâ€™s window as the argument.
