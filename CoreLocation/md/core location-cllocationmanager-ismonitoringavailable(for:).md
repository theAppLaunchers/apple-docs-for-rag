iOS 7.0+iPadOS 7.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.10+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
class func isMonitoringAvailable(for regionClass: AnyClass) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`regionClass`  

A region monitoring class from the MapKit framework. This class must descend from the CLRegion class.

## Return Value

true if the device is capable of monitoring regions using the specified class or false if it is not.

## Discussion

The availability of region monitoring support is dependent on the hardware present on the device. This method does not take into account the availability of location services or the fact that the user might have disabled them for the app or system; you must determine your appâ€™s authorization status separately.
