## Discussion

This property enables developers to make better-informed decisions as to whether to treat certain locations differently, or reject potentially simulated locations that they generate during testing. An app may choose to check this property and reject locations if, for example, the isSimulatedBySoftware property is `true` when the developer isnâ€™t debugging or testing the app.

Use the sourceInformation property when knowing the true location of the device (within a tolerance for estimation error and horizontal/vertical accuracy) is critical.
