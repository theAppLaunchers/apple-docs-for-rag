## Discussion

The value in this property represents the heading relative to the magnetic North Pole, which is different from the geographic North Pole. The value `0` means the device is pointed toward magnetic north, `90` means it is pointed east, `180` means it is pointed south, and so on. The value in this property should always be valid.

In iOS 3.x and earlier, the value in this property is always measured relative to the top of the device in a portrait orientation, regardless of the deviceâ€™s actual physical or interface orientation. In iOS 4.0 and later, the value is measured relative to the heading orientation specified by the location manager. For more information, see the headingOrientation property in CLLocationManager.

If the headingAccuracy property contains a negative value, the value in this property should be considered unreliable.
