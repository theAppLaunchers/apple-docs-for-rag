Instance Property

# horizontalAccuracy

The radius of uncertainty for the location, measured in meters.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.6+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
var horizontalAccuracy: CLLocationAccuracy { get }
```

## Discussion

The locationâ€™s latitude and longitude identify the center of the circle, and this value indicates the radius of that circle. A negative value indicates that the latitude and longitude are invalid.

### Special Considerations

In iOS, this property is declared as `nonatomic`. In macOS, it is declared as `atomic`.
