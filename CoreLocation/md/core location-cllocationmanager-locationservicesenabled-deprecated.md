Instance Property

# locationServicesEnabled

A Boolean value indicating whether location services are enabled on the device.

macOS 10.15â€“10.15Deprecated

``` source
var locationServicesEnabled: Bool { get }
```

Deprecated

Use the locationServicesEnabled() class method instead.

## Discussion

In iOS, the user can enable or disable location services using the controls in Settings \> Location Services. In macOS, the user can enable or disable location services from the Security & Privacy system preference.

If this property contains the value false and you start location updates anyway, the Core Location framework prompts the user with a confirmation alert asking whether location services should be reenabled.

### Special Considerations

In iOS, this property is declared as `nonatomic`. In macOS, it is declared as `atomic`.
