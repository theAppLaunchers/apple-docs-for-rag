Instance Method

# stopUpdatingHeading()

Stops the generation of heading updates.

iOS 3.0+iPadOS 3.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func stopUpdatingHeading()
```

## Discussion

Call this method whenever your code no longer needs to receive heading-related events. Disabling event delivery gives the receiver the option of disabling the appropriate hardware (and thereby saving power) when no clients need location data. You can always restart the generation of heading updates by calling the startUpdatingHeading() method again.

If a compatible iPad or iPhone app calls this method when running in visionOS, the method does nothing.
