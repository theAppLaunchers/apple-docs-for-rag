Instance Property

The largest boundary distance that can be assigned to a region.

``` source
var maximumRegionMonitoringDistance: CLLocationDistance { get }
```

## Discussion

This property defines the largest boundary distance allowed from a regionâ€™s center point. Attempting to monitor a region with a distance larger than this value causes the location manager to send a CLError.Code.regionMonitoringFailure error to the delegate.

If region monitoring is unavailable or not supported, the value in this property is `-1`.
