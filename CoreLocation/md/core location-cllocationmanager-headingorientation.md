Getting heading and course information

## Discussion

When computing heading values, the location manager assumes that the top of the device in portrait mode represents due north (0 degrees) by default. For apps that run in other orientations, this may not always be the most convenient orientation. This property allows you to specify which device orientation you want the location manager to use as the reference point for due north.

Although you can set the value of this property to CLDeviceOrientation.unknown, CLDeviceOrientation.faceUp, or CLDeviceOrientation.faceDown, doing so has no effect on the orientation reference point. The original reference point is retained instead.

Changing the value in this property affects only those heading values reported after the change is made.
