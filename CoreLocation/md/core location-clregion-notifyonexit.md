## Discussion

When this property is true, a device crossing from inside the region to outside the region triggers the delivery of a notification. If the property is false, a notification is not generated. The default value of this property is true.

If the app is not running when a boundary crossing occurs, the system launches the app into the background to handle it. Upon launch, your app must configure new location manager and delegate objects to receive the notification. The notification is sent to your delegateâ€™s locationManager(_:didExitRegion:) method.
