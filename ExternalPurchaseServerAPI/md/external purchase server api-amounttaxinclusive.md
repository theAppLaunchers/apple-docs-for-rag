## Discussion

This amount must equal taxAmount plus amountTaxExclusive.

Provide all amount field values in milli-units of the currency you state in the reportingCurrency field. One unit of the currency equals 1000 milli-units. For example, if the amount is `â‚¬2.99`, the amount in milli-units is `2990`.
