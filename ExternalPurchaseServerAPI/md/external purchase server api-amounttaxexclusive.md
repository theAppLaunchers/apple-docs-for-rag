## Discussion

This value must equal amountTaxInclusive minus taxAmount. The `amountTaxExclusive` value is the amount in milli-units that the user paid, excluding taxes. For refunds, it is the amount in milli-units of the refund, excluding taxes.

Provide all amount field values in milli-units of the currency you state in the reportingCurrency field. One unit of the currency equals 1000 milli-units. For example, if the amount is `â‚¬2.99`, the amount in milli-units is `2990`.
