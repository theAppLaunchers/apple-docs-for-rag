Use the `referenceLineItemId` field when reporting a transaction that needs to reference a previous transaction.

You report a transaction as a line item, which has a unique lineItemId. Use the original `lineItemId` as the `referenceLineItemId` to report the following types of new transactions:

- Refunds, which refer to the original transaction to which the refund applies

- Subscription events such as renewals, which refer to the initial buy transaction.

Line items include OneTimeBuyLineItem,RefundLineItem, and SubscriptionBuyLineItem.

A referenceLineItemId is valid when it references a line item in the same report, or in a report you previously submitted, successfully.
