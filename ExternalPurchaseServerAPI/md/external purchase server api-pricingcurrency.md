## Discussion

Maximum length: 128. Use a three-letter ISO 4217 currency code to specify the currency.

The `pricingCurrency` is the currency used in the transaction to charge or refund the customer. The pricing currency affects your reporting currency, reportingCurrency, which you use to report all amount values.

The currencies Apple supports are listed as allowed values on the reportingCurrency page.

Important

If your `pricingCurrency` isnâ€™t a currency that Apple supports, you must use EUR or USD as the reportingCurrency.
