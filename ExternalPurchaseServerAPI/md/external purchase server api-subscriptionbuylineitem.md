## Discussion

Use a `SubscriptionBuyLineItem` to report a subscription-related transaction or event, or a correction to the same.

Each line-item object represents one transaction. Other types of line-item objects include:

- OneTimeBuyLineItem, for reporting a one-time charge

- RefundLineItem, for reporting refunds

Include the line-item objects in the `lineItems` array of an ExternalPurchaseReport object. To send the report, include the ExternalPurchaseReport object in a request to the Send External Purchase Report endpoint.

Note

Identify a subscription using the lineItemId of the original subscription-start transaction. A line item for a subscription start has an eventType of `BUY` and a subscriptionEvent of `SUBSCRIPTION_START`.

For example, to report a renewal for a subscription, set the renewal transactionâ€™s referenceLineItemId to the `lineItemId` of the subscription-start line item, and set the `subscriptionEvent` to `RENEWAL`.
