## Discussion

Value must be a CFNumber object. Default is kCTUnderlineStyleNone. Set a value of something other than kCTUnderlineStyleNone to draw an underline. In addition, the constants listed in CTUnderlineStyleModifiers can be used to modify the look of the underline. The underline color is determined by the text’s foreground color.
