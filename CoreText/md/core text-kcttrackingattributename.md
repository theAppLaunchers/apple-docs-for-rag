let kCTTrackingAttributeName: CFString
```

## Discussion

The value associated with this attribute must be a doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/corefoundation/cfnumber-rjd float. The default is `0` (no tracking).

Tracking adds space, in points, between the specified character cluster. A positive value increases the spacing between characters, while a negative value brings the characters closer together. For example, setting kCTTrackingAttributeName to 0.1 adds 0.1 point of spacing between each character of the text.

The effect of this attribute is similar to kCTKernAttributeName, but it treats tracking as trailing whitespace and a nonzero amount disables nonessential ligatures, unless overridden by the presence of kCTLigatureAttributeName.

Important

If you apply both kCTTrackingAttributeName and kCTKernAttributeName, kCTTrackingAttributeName supersedes kCTKernAttributeName.
