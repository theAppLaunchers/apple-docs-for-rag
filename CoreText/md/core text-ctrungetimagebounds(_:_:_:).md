``` source
func CTRunGetImageBounds(
    _ run: CTRun,
    _ context: CGContext?,
    _ range: CFRange
) -> CGRect
```

## Parameters 

`run`  

The run for which to calculate the image bounds.

`context`  

The context for the image bounds being calculated. This is required because the context could have settings in it that would cause changes in the image bounds.

`range`  

The portion of the run to measure. If the length of the range is set to `0`, then the measure operation continues from the start index of the range to the end of the run.

## Return Value

A rectangle that tightly encloses the paths of the runâ€™s glyphs, or, if `run`, `context`, or `range` is invalid, CGRectNull.
