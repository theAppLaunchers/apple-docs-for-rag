``` source
func CTLineGetImageBounds(
    _ line: CTLine,
    _ context: CGContext?
) -> CGRect
```

## Parameters 

`line`  

The line whose image bounds are calculated.

`context`  

The context for which the image bounds are calculated. This is required because the context could have settings in it that would cause changes in the image bounds.

## Return Value

A rectangle that tightly encloses the paths of the lineâ€™s glyphs, or, if the line or context is invalid, CGRectNull.
