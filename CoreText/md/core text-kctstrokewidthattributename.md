## Discussion

Value must be a CFNumber object. Default value is `0.0`, or no stroke. This attribute, interpreted as a percentage of font point size, controls the text drawing mode: positive values effect drawing with stroke only; negative values are for stroke and fill. A typical value for outlined text is `3.0`.
