``` source
func CTRunGetTypographicBounds(
    _ run: CTRun,
    _ range: CFRange,
    _ ascent: UnsafeMutablePointer?,
    _ descent: UnsafeMutablePointer?,
    _ leading: UnsafeMutablePointer?
) -> Double
```

## Parameters 

`run`  

The run for which to calculate the typographic bounds.

`range`  

The portion of the run to measure. If the length of the range is set to `0`, then the measure operation continues from the rangeâ€™s start index to the end of the run.

`ascent`  

On output, the ascent of the run. This can be set to `NULL` if not needed.

`descent`  

On output, the descent of the run. This can be set to `NULL` if not needed.

`leading`  

On output, the leading of the run. This can be set to `NULL` if not needed.

## Return Value

The typographic width of the run, or if `run` or `range` is invalid, `0`.
