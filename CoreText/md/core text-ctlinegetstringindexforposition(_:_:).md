``` source
func CTLineGetStringIndexForPosition(
    _ line: CTLine,
    _ position: CGPoint
) -> CFIndex
```

## Parameters 

`line`  

The line being examined.

`position`  

The location of the mouse click relative to the lineâ€™s origin.

## Return Value

The string index for the position, or if the line does not support string access, kCFNotFound. Relative to the lineâ€™s string range, this value can be no less than the first string index and no greater than the last string index plus 1.

## Discussion

This function can be used to determine the string index for a mouse click or other event. This string index corresponds to the character before which the next character should be inserted. This determination is made by analyzing the string from which a typesetter was created and the corresponding glyphs as embodied by a particular line.
