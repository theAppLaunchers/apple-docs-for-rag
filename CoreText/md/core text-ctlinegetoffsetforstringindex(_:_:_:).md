Function

# CTLineGetOffsetForStringIndex(\_:\_:\_:)

Determines the graphical offset or offsets for a string index.

``` source
func CTLineGetOffsetForStringIndex(
    _ line: CTLine,
    _ charIndex: CFIndex,
    _ secondaryOffset: UnsafeMutablePointer?
) -> CGFloat
```

## Parameters 

`line`  

The line from which the offset is requested.

`charIndex`  

The string index corresponding to the desired position.

`secondaryOffset`  

On output, the secondary offset along the baseline for `charIndex`. When a single caret is sufficient for a string index, this value will be the same as the primary offset, which is the return value of this function. May be `NULL`.

## Return Value

The primary offset along the baseline for `charIndex`, or `0.0` if the line does not support string access.

## Discussion

This function returns the graphical offset or offsets corresponding to a string index, suitable for movement between adjacent lines or for drawing a custom caret. For moving between adjacent lines, the primary offset can be adjusted for any relative indentation of the two lines; a CGPoint constructed with the adjusted offset for its `x` value and `0.0` for its `y` value is suitable for passing to CTLineGetStringIndexForPosition(_:_:). For drawing a custom caret, the returned primary offset corresponds to the portion of the caret that represents the visual insertion location for a character whose direction matches the lineâ€™s writing direction.
