Initializer

# init(queryString:ignoredEmails:ignoredPhoneNumbers:approvalCallback:)

Creates a contact access button to quickly add contacts under limited-access authorization.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
init(
    queryString query: String,
    ignoredEmails: Set? = nil,
    ignoredPhoneNumbers: Set? = nil,
    approvalCallback: (([String]) -> ())? = nil
)
```

## Parameters 

`query`  

A string to match against contacts not yet exposed to the app. You typically get this value from a search UI that your app presents, like a text field.

`ignoredEmails`  

A set of email addresses, as string values. The search omits contacts matching `query` that also match any email address in this set.

`ignoredPhoneNumbers`  

A set of phone numbers, as string values. The search omits contacts matching `query` that also match any phone number in this set.

`approvalCallback`  

A closure invoked when a person taps the button and adds one or more contacts to the app. The parameter to the closure is an array of contact identifiers, as strings.

## Discussion

This button uses the `query` string to match contacts that the person hasnâ€™t yet exposed to your app. If a single contact matches the search criteria, the button presents that contact and adds it to the limited-access set when tapped. If multiple contacts match, tapping the button navigates to another view where the person can choose contacts to add.
