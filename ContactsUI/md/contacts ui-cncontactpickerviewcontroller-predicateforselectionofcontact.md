``` source
@NSCopying @MainActor
var predicateForSelectionOfContact: NSPredicate? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property determines whether a selected contact should be returned (when the predicate evaluates to TRUE), or a default action for the property should be performed (when the predicate evaluates to FALSE). By default the contact picker view controller displays the contactâ€™s detail card when a contact is selected. To learn about predicates, see NSPredicate.
