func present(_ pass: PKPaymentPass)
```

Deprecated

Use present(_:) instead.

## Parameters 

`pass`  

The pass to present.

## Discussion

You can use present(_:) to present your payment pass for use in-store. Your app must have the proper entitlement to see the payment pass that you present. Therefore, this method is mostly relevant to a bank or merchant app that presents its own payment method for use in-store.
