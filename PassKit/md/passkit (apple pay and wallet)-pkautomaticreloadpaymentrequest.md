## Overview

Important

You must set the automaticReloadPaymentRequest property on a PKPaymentRequest object to use the PKAutomaticReloadPaymentRequest class and set up an automatic reload payment.

Apple Pay issues an Apple Pay Merchant Token if the userâ€™s payment network supports merchant-specific payment tokens. Otherwise, Apple Pay issues a device token for the payment request.

Use a PKAutomaticReloadPaymentRequest object to provide the user with payment details and a way to manage payment methods for an automatic reload payment. You can optionally display a billing agreement and set up merchant token life cycle notifications for the request.
