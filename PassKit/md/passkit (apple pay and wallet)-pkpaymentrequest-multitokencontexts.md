## Discussion

Use multitoken contexts to indicate payments for multiple merchants. This property is an array of PKPaymentTokenContext objects. The sum of all payment token contexts must be less than or equal to the grand total of the enclosing payment request listed as the last payment summary item, PKPaymentSummaryItem. Otherwise, the request results in a runtime error and cancels the payment request.

Important

You canâ€™t use this property with recurringPaymentRequest or automaticReloadPaymentRequest properties. Simultaneous use of these properties results in a runtime error and cancels the payment request.
