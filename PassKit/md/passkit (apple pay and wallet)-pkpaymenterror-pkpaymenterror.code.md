## Overview

The user must resolve any errors that you report on the Apple Pay sheet before theyâ€™re able to authorize the transaction. You return any errors in PKPaymentAuthorizationResult or PKPaymentRequestShippingContactUpdate.

You can build your own payment error (NSError), or use one of the following convenience methods from PKPaymentRequest to build it for you.

For an error with contact information: paymentContactInvalidError(withContactField:localizedDescription:).

For a shipping address that is unserviceable: paymentShippingAddressUnserviceableError(withLocalizedDescription:).

For an error with the billing address: paymentBillingAddressInvalidError(withKey:localizedDescription:).

For an error with the shipping address: paymentShippingAddressInvalidError(withKey:localizedDescription:).
