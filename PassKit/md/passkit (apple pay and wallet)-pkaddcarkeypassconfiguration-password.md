## Discussion

When creating a digital car key, the vehicle manufacturer emails the user a one-time password to verify their identity. Set this propertyâ€™s value to that password before you use the configuration to initialize PKAddSecureElementPassViewController, and PassKit verifies that the passwords match as it creates the pass.
