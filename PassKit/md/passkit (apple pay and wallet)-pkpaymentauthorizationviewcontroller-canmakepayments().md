class func canMakePayments() -> Bool
```

## Return Value

true if the device supports making payments; otherwise, false.

## Discussion

User may not be able to make payments for a variety of reasons. For example, this functionality may not be supported by their hardware, or it may be restricted by parental controls.

On devices that support making payments but donâ€™t have any payment cards configured, the canMakePayments() method returns true because the hardware and parental controls allow making payments, but the canMakePayments(usingNetworks:) method returns false regardless of network.
