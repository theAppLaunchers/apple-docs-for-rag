## Discussion

Use this property for additional data as may be appropriate for your appâ€”for example, a shopping cart identifier or an order number.

A hash of this data is included in the signed payment data (the paymentData property of PKPaymentToken). You are responsible for sending the full application data to your server, if needed.
