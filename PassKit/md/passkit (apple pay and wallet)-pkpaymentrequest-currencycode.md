## Discussion

Set this property to the three-letter code for the currency used by this payment request. Apple Pay interprets the amounts provided by the summary items attached to this request as amounts in this currency.

The framework translates the currency code from the alphabetic code to the corresponding numeric code. The numeric code is passed to the Secure Element and appears in the encrypted payment data. For more information on the Secure Element, see A Payment Token Is Created When a Payment Is Authorized in Apple Pay Programming Guide.
