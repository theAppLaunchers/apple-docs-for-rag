```

## Discussion

This array must contain one PKPaymentSummaryItem, which contains the amount the individual receives. This may differ from the total amount withdrawn â€” for example, if the transfer has an associated fee. The framework displays the amount this PKPaymentSummaryItem item represents on the main Apple Pay sheet.

This array may contain up to one PKInstantFundsOutFeeSummaryItem to represent a fee deducted as part of an instant transfer, if applicable. The framework also presents this fee on the main sheet when you initialize the PKDisbursementRequest with the instantFundsOut capability option.

You can specify other line items (such as fees not associated with an instant transfer) using PKPaymentSummaryItem.

If you specify multiple summary items, the last item must represent the total of all previous items.
