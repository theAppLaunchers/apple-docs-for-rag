## Discussion

Logging a message of this type is equivalent to calling the os_log function. Use this level to capture information about things that might result in a failure.

The system stores default-level messages in memory buffers and, without a configuration change, compresses the messages and writes them to the data store as those buffers fill up. They remain in the data store until the storeâ€™s size exceeds its storage quota, at which point, the system purges the oldest messages in the store to free up space.
