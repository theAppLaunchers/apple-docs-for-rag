## Discussion

Multiple intervals with matching log objects and interval names can be in-flight simultaneously. In order for data-processing tools to correctly match the beginning and end of an interval, you need to identify each interval with a unique signpost identifier. Use the first strategy in the list below that matches your use case:

- If you can guarantee that intervals with the same log and name can never overlap in time, specify OS_SIGNPOST_ID_EXCLUSIVE as the signpost ID.

- If you already have your own integer data that can uniquely identify each instance of the task being measured, cast the data from a uint64_t value directly to a `os_signpost_id_t`. The value must not match one of the predefined signpost values.

- If you have a pointer that can uniquely identify begin/end pairs (such as a pointer to a data object used by the code being measured), call os_signpost_id_make_with_pointer. Donâ€™t use this function for signposts that span process boundaries.

- Otherwise, call os_signpost_id_generate each time you create a new pair of signposts to generate a unique value for that pair.
