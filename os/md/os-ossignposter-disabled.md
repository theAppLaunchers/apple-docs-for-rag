## Discussion

You can use the signposter this property returns to disable signposts in your production builds without having to refactor your code, as the following example demonstrates:

```
let signposter: OSSignposter
#if DEBUG
signposter = OSSignposter()
#else
signposter = OSSignposter.disabled
#endif
```

To determine if a signposter can emit signposts, use the isEnabled property.
