## Discussion

Logging a message of this type is equivalent to calling the os_log_info function. Use this level to capture information that may be helpful, but not essential, for troubleshooting errors.

The system stores info-level messages in memory buffers and, without a configuration change, purges the oldest messages as those buffers fill up. However, the system writes the messages to the data store when faults and, optionally, errors occur. Info-level messages remain in the data store until the storeâ€™s size exceeds its storage quota, at which point, the system purges the oldest messages in the data store to free up space.
