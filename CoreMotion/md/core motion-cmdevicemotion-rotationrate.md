## Discussion

A CMRotationRate structure contains data specifying the deviceâ€™s rate of rotation around three axes. The value of this property contains a measurement of gyroscope data whose bias has been removed by Core Motion algorithms. The identically name property of CMGyroData, on the other hand, gives the raw data from the gyroscope. The structure type is declared in `CMGyroData.h`.
