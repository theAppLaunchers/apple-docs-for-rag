``` source
class CMAccelerometerData
```

## Overview

An application accesses `CMAccelerometerData` objects through the block handler specified as the last parameter of the startAccelerometerUpdates(to:withHandler:) method and through the accelerometerData property, both declared by the `CMMotionManager` class. The superclass of `CMAccelerometerData`, CMLogItem, defines a timestamp property that records when the acceleration measurement was taken.

## Topics

### Accessing Accelerometer Data

var acceleration: CMAcceleration
