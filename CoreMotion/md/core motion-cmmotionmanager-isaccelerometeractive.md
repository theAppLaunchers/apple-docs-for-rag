## Discussion

This property indicates whether startAccelerometerUpdates(to:withHandler:) or startAccelerometerUpdates() has been called since the last time stopAccelerometerUpdates() was called. (If the start methods hadnâ€™t been called, the app could be getting updates from the accelerometer after calling, for example, startDeviceMotionUpdates(), but this property would return false.)
