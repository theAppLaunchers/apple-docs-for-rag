Download

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Xcode 16.1+

## Overview

This sample app demonstrates how to use `CMHeadphoneActivityManager` to request updates when the current type of motion changes. When a change occurs, the app receives update information as a CMMotionActivity object, which it uses to show a text description of the motion change.

### Configure the sample code project

Because this sample app uses headphone motion updates, it needs to run on a device, not in Simulator. To run this sample, youâ€™ll need the following:

- An iOS device with iOS 18 or later

- Headphones that support motion updates, such as AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods 4
