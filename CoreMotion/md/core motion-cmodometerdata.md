## Overview

To get the measurements, use the speed and slope properties. To compute distances, use the deltaDistance and deltaAltitude properties.

## Topics

### Getting speed and slope

var speed: CLLocationSpeed

The instantaneous velocity of the device, measured in meters per second.

var slope: Double?

The slope at the location toward the direction of travel, measured in degrees.

var maxAbsSlope: Double?

The maximum absolute slope at the location toward all directions, measured in degrees.

### Getting date and times

var startDate: Date

The time that the device starts recording the odometer data.

var endDate: Date

The time that the device stops recording the odometer data.

var gpsDate: Date

The time of the GPS measurement associated with the location.

### Measuring distances

var deltaDistance: CLLocationDistance

The change in distance that the user travels since the last location, measured in meters.

var deltaAltitude: CLLocationDistance

The change in altitude above mean sea level associated with the location, measured in meters.

### Getting the location accuracy

var speedAccuracy: CLLocationSpeedAccuracy

The accuracy of the speed value.

var verticalAccuracy: CLLocationAccuracy

The validity of the altitude values and their estimated uncertainty, measured in meters.

var deltaDistanceAccuracy: CLLocationAccuracy

The accuracy of the change in distance value.

### Getting the device

var originDevice: CMOdometerOriginDevice

The device that measures the data.

enum CMOdometerOriginDevice

The device that the odometer sample originates from.
