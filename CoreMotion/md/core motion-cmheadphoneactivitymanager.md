# CMHeadphoneActivityManager

An object that starts and manages headphone activity services.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+watchOS 11.0+

``` source
class CMHeadphoneActivityManager
```

## Overview

This class delivers headphone activity updates to your app. Use an instance of the manager to determine if the device supports headphone activity updates, and to start and stop updates. Before using this class, check isActivityAvailable and isStatusAvailable to make sure the features are available.

This class provides similar information to CMMotionActivityManager, except the activity information comes from headphone motion, rather than from device motion.

Important

In iOS and macOS, include the NSMotionUsageDescription key in your appâ€™s `Info.plist` file. If this key is absent, trying to start headphone activity updates terminates your app.
