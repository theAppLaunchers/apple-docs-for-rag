## Discussion

This property indicates whether startGyroUpdates(to:withHandler:) or startGyroUpdates() has been called since the last time stopGyroUpdates() was called. (If the start methods hadnâ€™t been called, the app could be getting updates from the gyroscope after calling, for example, startDeviceMotionUpdates(), but this property would return false.)
