## Discussion

Use this option to determine the attitude of the device relative to true north. For example, you might use this to implement more precise navigation. The yaw (Z-axis) value in CMAttitude is `0` when the X axis is aligned with true north.

The device must have a magnetometer and that sensor must be available. Location services must also be available to calculate the difference between magnetic and true north. If the magnetometer isnâ€™t currently calibrated, Core Motion prompts the person to move the device to calibrate it.

static var xMagneticNorthZVertical: CMAttitudeReferenceFrame

A reference frame where the Z axis is vertical and the X axis points to the magnetic north pole.
