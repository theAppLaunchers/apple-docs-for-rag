## Discussion

If the device-motion service is active, this property returns the reference frame currently in use. If the service is inactive, but your app started it at some point since launch, this property contains the last reference frame you used. If you havenâ€™t started the device-motion service since app launch, this property returns the default frame of reference, which is xArbitraryZVertical.

If device motion is not available on the current device, the value of this property is undefined.
