## Discussion

This property indicates whether the startMagnetometerUpdates(to:withHandler:) or startMagnetometerUpdates() method has been called since the last time the stopMagnetometerUpdates() method was called. (If the start methods hadnâ€™t been called, the app could be getting updates from the magnetometer after calling, for example, startDeviceMotionUpdates(), but this property would return false.)
