## Topics

### Accessing the Data

var mFlags: AudioTimeStampFlags

A set of flags indicating which representations of the time are valid; see `Audio Time Stamp Flags` and `Audio Time Stamp Flag Combination Constant`.

var mHostTime: UInt64

The host machineâ€™s time base (see `CoreAudio/HostTime.h`).

var mRateScalar: Float64

The ratio of actual host ticks per sample frame to the nominal host ticks per sample frame.

var mReserved: UInt32

Pads the structure out to force an even 8-byte alignment.

var mSMPTETime: SMPTETime

The SMPTE time (see SMPTETime).

var mSampleTime: Float64

The absolute sample frame time.

var mWordClockTime: UInt64

The word clock time.

### Initializers

init()

Creates an empty audio timestamp.

init(mSampleTime: Float64, mHostTime: UInt64, mRateScalar: Float64, mWordClockTime: UInt64, mSMPTETime: SMPTETime, mFlags: AudioTimeStampFlags, mReserved: UInt32)

Creates an audio time stamp.
