### Constants

case AAC_LTP

A constant that specifies long-term prediction, which reduces redundancy in a coded signal.

case aac_Main

A constant that specifies advanced audio coding, which is the basic MPEG-4 technology.

case AAC_SBR

A constant that specifies spectral band replication, which reconstructs high-frequency content from lower frequencies and side information.

case AAC_SSR

A constant that specifies scalable sampling rate, which provides different sampling frequencies for different targets.

case aac_Scalable

A constant that specifies scalable lossless coding.

A constant that specifies code-excited linear prediction, which is a narrow-band/wide-band speech codec.

case HVXC

A constant that specifies harmonic vector excitation coding, which is a very-low bit-rate parametric speech codec.

case twinVQ

A constant that specifies transform-domain weighted interleaved vector quantization.
