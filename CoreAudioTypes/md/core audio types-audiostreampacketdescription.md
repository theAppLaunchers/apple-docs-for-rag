``` source
struct AudioStreamPacketDescription
```

## Overview

For data formats where the packet size isnâ€™t constant, such as variable bit rate data and data where the channels have unequal sizes, use this structure to supplement the information in the AudioStreamBasicDescription structure.

## Topics

### Inspecting an audio stream packet description

var mDataByteSize: UInt32

The number of bytes in the packet.

var mStartOffset: Int64

The number of bytes from the start of the buffer to the beginning of the packet.

var mVariableFramesInPacket: UInt32

The number of sample frames of data in the packet.

### Creating an audio stream packet descripiton

init()

Creates an audio stream basic description.

init(mStartOffset: Int64, mVariableFramesInPacket: UInt32, mDataByteSize: UInt32)

Creates an audio stream basic description with the start offset, and the number of sample frames and bytes in the packet that you specify.
