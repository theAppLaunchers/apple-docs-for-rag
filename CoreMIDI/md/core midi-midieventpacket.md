## Topics

### Configuring an Event Packet

var timeStamp: MIDITimeStamp

The event packet timestamp.

var wordCount: UInt32

The number of valid MIDI 32-bit words in this event packet.

var words: (UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32)

A variable-length stream of native-endian 32-bit Universal MIDI Packets (UMP).

### Event list management

func MIDIEventListInit(UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;MIDIEventList>, MIDIProtocolID) -> UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;MIDIEventPacket>

Initializes an event list.

func MIDIEventListAdd(UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;MIDIEventList>, Int, UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;MIDIEventPacket>, MIDITimeStamp, Int, UnsafePointer&lt;UInt32>) -> UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;MIDIEventPacket>

Adds an event to an event list.

func MIDIEventPacketNext(UnsafePointer&lt;MIDIEventPacket>) -> UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;MIDIEventPacket>

Advances a packet pointer to the next packet in memory, if the packet is part of an event list.

func MIDISendEventList(MIDIPortRef, MIDIEndpointRef, UnsafePointer&lt;MIDIEventList>) -> OSStatus

Sends MIDI events to a destination.

func MIDIReceivedEventList(MIDIEndpointRef, UnsafePointer&lt;MIDIEventList>) -> OSStatus

Distributes incoming MIDI events from a source to its connected client input ports.
