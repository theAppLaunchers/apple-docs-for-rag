# MIDIReadProc

A function receiving MIDI input.

iOS 4.2+iPadOS 4.2+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.0–11.0DeprecatedvisionOS 1.0–2.4Deprecated

``` source
typealias MIDIReadProc = (UnsafePointer, UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Void
```

Deprecated

use MIDIReceiveBlock and MIDIEventLists

## Parameters 

`pktlist`  

The incoming MIDI message(s).

`readProcRefCon`  

The refCon you passed to MIDIInputPortCreate or MIDIDestinationCreate

`srcConnRefCon`  

A refCon you passed to MIDIPortConnectSource, which identifies the source of the data.

## Discussion

This is a callback function through which a client receives incoming MIDI messages.

A MIDIReadProc function pointer is passed to the MIDIInputPortCreate and MIDIDestinationCreate functions. The CoreMIDI framework will create a high-priority receive thread on your client’s behalf, and from that thread, your MIDIReadProc will be called when incoming MIDI messages arrive.
