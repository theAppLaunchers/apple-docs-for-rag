``` source

    toPhoneNumber phoneNumber: String,
    completionHandler handler: @escaping (Bool, (any Error)?) -> Void
)
```

```

## Parameters 

`phoneNumber`  

The phone number to dial.

`handler`  

The completion handler invoked with the status of the voice call.

## Discussion

Important

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
func dialVoiceCall(toPhoneNumber phoneNumber: String) async throws -> Bool
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

Apps running in the background or foreground can request to dial a voice call without confirmation. The system doesnâ€™t allow emergency numbers such as 112, 911, or 999.

The system accepts requests only if the app is authorized to receive and handle Crash Detection events, and only for a limited time after a Crash Detection event occurs.
