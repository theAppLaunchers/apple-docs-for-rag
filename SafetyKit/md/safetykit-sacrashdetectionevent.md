## Overview

When a vehicular crash occurs, SafetyKit calls your delegateâ€™s crashDetectionManager(_:didDetect:) method with an SACrashDetectionEvent object. Inspect this object to determine information about the crash, including the date and time, location, and if the system attempted to contact emergency services.

## Topics

enum Response

var date: Date
