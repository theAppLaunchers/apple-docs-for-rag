Instance Method

# disableExecution(\_:)

Allows you to perform custom tasks when the execution of the `QCPlugIn` object is paused.

macOS 10.4â€“10.15Deprecated

``` source
func disableExecution(_ context: (any QCPlugInContext)!)
```

Deprecated

QuartzComposer API deprecated. (Define QC_SILENCE_DEPRECATION to silence these warnings)

## Parameters 

`context`  

An opaque object , conforming to the QCPlugInContext protocol, that represents the execution context of the `QCPlugIn` object. Do not retain this object or use it outside of the scope of this method.

## Discussion

The Quartz Composer engine calls this method when results are no longer being pulled from the custom patch. You can optionally override this execution method to perform custom tasks at that time.
