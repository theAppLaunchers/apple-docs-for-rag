# QCPlugInViewController

The `QCPlugInViewController` class communicates (through Cocoa bindings) between a custom patch and the view used for the internal settings of the custom patch. Only custom patches that use internal settings exposed to the user need to use the `QCPlugInViewController` class.

## Overview

You access the internal settings of a custom patch through key-value coding (KVC). All the KVC keys that represent the internal settings of the custom patch must be listed in its `plugInKeys` method.

The view controller for a custom patch expects

- the nib file `File's Owner` class set to the `QCPlugInViewController` class

- the view outlet connected to the view that contains the editing controls

The controls are bound to the `File's Owner` as the target and `plugIn.XXX` as the model key path, where `XXX` is the KVC key for a given internal setting of the custom patch instance.

## Topics

### Creating a Controller

init!(plugIn: QCPlugIn!, viewNibName: String!)

Creates and initializes a controller for the specified `QCPlugIn` object and nib file.

### Getting the QCPlugIn Object

func plugIn() -> QCPlugIn!

Returns the `QCPlugIn` object associated with the view controller for the custom patch.

Deprecated

class QCCompositionPickerPanel

The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class represents a utility window that allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository and, if supported, preview the composition. The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class cannot be subclassed.

Deprecated

class QCCompositionPickerView

The `QCCompositionPickerView` class allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository, and to preview them. You can set the default input parameters for a composition preview by using the method setDefaultValue:forInputKey:.

Deprecated

class QCCompositionRepository

The `QCCompositionRepository` class represents a system-wide centralized repository of built-in and installed Quartz Composer compositions (`/Library/Compositions` and `~/Library/Compositions`). The `QCCompositionRepository` class cannot be subclassed.

Deprecated

class QCPatchControllerDeprecated

class QCPlugIn

A base class to subclass for writing custom patches.

Deprecated

class QCRenderer

A base class for low-level rendering.
