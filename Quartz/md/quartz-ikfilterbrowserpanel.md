# IKFilterBrowserPanel

Presents a user interface for browsing filters.

macOS 10.4+

``` source
@MainActor
class IKFilterBrowserPanel
```

## Overview

The `IKFilterBrowserPanel` class provides a user interface that allows users to browse Core Image filters (CIFilter), to preview a filter, and to get additional information about the filter, such as its description.

An `IKFilterBrowserPanel` object can be displayed as:

- a separate panel, that is, a utility window that floats on top of document windows

- a modal dialog

- a sheet, that is, a dialog that is attached to its parent window and must be dismissed by the user

- a view that an application can insert into a custom user interface

An `IKFilterBrowserPanel` object can be configured through a style mask to use either the default or brushed metal look for windows. The size and number of visible controls are specified through an options dictionary. An `IKFilterBrowserPanel` object communicates selection changes through notifications.

The `IKFilterBrowserPanel` class allows the user to create filter collections that are stored with the `filterCollections` key in the `com.apple.CoreImageKit.plist` property list located in `~/Library/Preferences/`.
