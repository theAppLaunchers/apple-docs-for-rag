Deprecated

QuartzComposer API deprecated. (Define QC_SILENCE_DEPRECATION to silence these warnings)

## Parameters 

`context`  

An opaque object , conforming to the QCPlugInContext protocol, that represents the execution context of the `QCPlugIn` object. Do not retain this object or use it outside of the scope of this method.

## Return Value

false indicates a fatal error occurred and prevents the Quartz Composer engine from starting.

## Discussion

The Quartz Composer engine calls this method when your custom patch starts to render. You can optionally override this execution method to perform setup tasks.
