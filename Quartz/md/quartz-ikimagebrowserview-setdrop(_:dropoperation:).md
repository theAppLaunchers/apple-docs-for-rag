Instance Method

# setDrop(\_:dropOperation:)

Allows the class to retarget the drop action.

macOS 10.4+

``` source
@MainActor
func setDrop(
    _ index: Int,
    dropOperation operation: IKImageBrowserDropOperation
)
```

## Parameters 

`index`  

The requested drop index.

`operation`  

The requested drop operation. The possible values are described in IKImageBrowserDropOperation.

## Discussion

For example, To specify a drop on the second item, one would specify index as `1`, and operation as IKImageBrowserDropOn. To specify a drop after the last item, one would specify index as the number of items and operation as IKImageBrowserDropBefore.

Passing a value of `â€“1` for `index`, and IKImageBrowserDropOn as the operation causes the entire browser view to be highlighted rather than a specific item. This is useful if the data displayed by the receiver does not allow the user to drop items at a specific item location

.
