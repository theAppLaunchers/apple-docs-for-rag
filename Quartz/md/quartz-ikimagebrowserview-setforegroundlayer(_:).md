## Discussion

The foreground overlay layer can have sublayers. Additionally, the layers can also contain animations.

The foreground layer is an overlay that is applied to the view. It can be used to provide information such as loading progress or for pure cosmetic purposes, such as dark gradients on top and bottom of the browser view.

This layer is optional.
