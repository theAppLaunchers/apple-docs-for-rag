## Overview

You donâ€™t need to create an instance of `ObservationRegistrar` when using the Observable() macro to indicate observability of a type.

## Topics

### Creating an observation registrar

init()

Creates an instance of the observation registrar.

### Receiving change notifications

func willSet&lt;Subject, Member>(Subject, keyPath: KeyPath&lt;Subject, Member>)

A property observation called before setting the value of the subject.

func didSet&lt;Subject, Member>(Subject, keyPath: KeyPath&lt;Subject, Member>)

A property observation called after setting the value of the subject.

### Identifying transactional access

func access&lt;Subject, Member>(Subject, keyPath: KeyPath&lt;Subject, Member>)

Registers access to a specific property for observation.

func withMutation&lt;Subject, Member, T>(of: Subject, keyPath: KeyPath&lt;Subject, Member>, () throws -> T) rethrows -> T

Identifies mutations to the transactions registered for observers.
