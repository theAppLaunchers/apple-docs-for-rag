The following table shows how this time rate affects subscriptions with various renewal periods in the testing environment:

| Subscription renewal period | Renewal time        |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Weekly                      | 10 seconds          |

| Bimonthly                   | 1 minute            |
| Quarterly                   | 1 minute 30 seconds |
| Semiannually                | 3 minutes           |
| Annually                    | 6 minutes           |

The sandbox environment doesnâ€™t have an equivalent subscription renewal rate for SKTestSession.TimeRate.monthlyRenewalEveryThirtySeconds. For more information about renewal rates in the sandbox environment, see Test in-app purchases.

The time rate also affects the billing grace period and the billing retry period in the testing environment, as the table below shows:

| Type                                                          | Time period |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Grace period for subscriptions with a weekly renewal period   | 9 seconds   |
| Grace period for subscriptions with all other renewal periods | 15 seconds  |
| Billing retry period                                          | 1 minute    |
