## Discussion

When you delete a transaction, the test environment also removes the existing transaction from the receipt. Some transactions donâ€™t appear in the receipt, including finished consumable purchases, failed purchases, Ask To Buy transactions pending approval, and restored purchases. Deleting a transaction deletes its child transactions, for example:

- Deleting an original subscription transaction deletes all related renewal transactions.

- Deleting a transaction deletes any associated restored transactions.
