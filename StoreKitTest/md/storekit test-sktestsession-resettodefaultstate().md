## Discussion

During testing, your tests may override the property settings such as the timeRate, askToBuyEnabled, interruptedPurchasesEnabled, and billingGracePeriodIsEnabled. Call this method to revert all the property settings to the states defined in the StoreKit configuration file that you use to initialize this SKTestSession instance.

See clearTransactions() to remove all transactions from the testing environment.
