## Discussion

This function retrieves the next frame for you to use in your drawing operations. The system maintains a limited number of frames, so donâ€™t try to render more than one frame in advance. If this function returns `nil`, wait a short time and try again. When the system finishes displaying a rendered frame, it returns that frame to the shared pool and makes it available for you to use again.

The index of each returned frame is always greater than the index of the previous frame. The system increments index values sequentially so you can differentiate frames you are currently drawing.
