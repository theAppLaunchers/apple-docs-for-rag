``` source
var depthRange: simd_float2 { get nonmutating set }
```

## Discussion

Apply the depth range for drawing to the drawable that it applies to. The compositor uses these values to compute the perspective projection matrix, which clips content thatâ€™s not between the near and far planes.

Compositor Services stores the values in reverse-z order in a 2D floating-point vector:

- The `x` property stores the distance of the far plane.

- The `y` property stores the distance of the near plane.
