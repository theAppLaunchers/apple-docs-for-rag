## Discussion

Foveation support lets you reduce the amount of high-resolution drawing you do. When foveation support is available, the system provides a variable rasterization rate map that defines the content resolution in different parts of the texture. This map allows you to render content in someoneâ€™s peripheral vision at a lower resolution than content in the center of their vision.
