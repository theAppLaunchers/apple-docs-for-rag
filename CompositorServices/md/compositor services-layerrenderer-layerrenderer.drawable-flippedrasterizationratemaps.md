## Discussion

Apply a flipped rasterization rate map to your render descriptor when you set up your drawing environment. Rasterization rate maps define how the GPU scales different parts of the texture to fill the display. You use them to save time and render less important parts of your scene at lower resolutions. For example, the drawable includes a rasterization rate map to render the portions of the texture in someoneâ€™s peripheral vision at a lower resolution. Flipped rasterization rate maps are available only when foveation is enabled and the generateFlippedRasterizationRateMaps property of your layer configuration is `true`.
