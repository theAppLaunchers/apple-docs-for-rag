# App Store Purchases

Analyze total revenue generated by your apps on the App Store.

## Overview

The App Store Purchases Report includes App Store paid app and in-app purchase data. Using the data in this report, you can measure your total revenue generated on the App Store, attribute sales to download sources and page types, and measure how many paying users you have for each individual row. Paying user counts are not summable across rows, because the same user can exist in multiple rows.
