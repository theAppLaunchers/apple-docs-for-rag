# Bluetooth LE Scans

Review how your app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) scans.

## Overview

This report contains information about LE Scan duration and time spent in foreground and background.

- Territories: Worldwide

- Platforms: iOS, iPadOS. For more information about iOS and iPadOS, see the Platforms section in Data Completeness and Corrections.

- Availability:

  - Daily: Every day.

- History: On request, data is available beginning with iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4.

- Completeness: Data from devices that contribute to this report can arrive as late as 8 days after the date it generates on device. You can download recent data daily, but it might be incomplete, and data updates incrementally daily, until all late-arriving events are available.

- Privacy:

  - Includes data from users who have opted to share their data with Apple and developers.

  - Individual rows will only appear if they have a value of 5 or more.

- Data Context: You can analyze your data with additional context by comparing it with the data in the App Sessions Context report, which provides a count of unique devices that use your app on a specific day. For example, if your app performed an action detailed in this report on 10 unique devices on a specific day, and the App Sessions Context report shows there were 100 unique devices running your app that day, then you can approximate that 10% of the devices running your app performed that action.
