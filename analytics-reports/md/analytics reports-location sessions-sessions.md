# Location Sessions

Review how your app uses Core Location APIs.

## Overview

The data in this report shows the location usage histogram of apps. The information is made up of multiple dimensions including the daily total of location sessions, counts of delivered locations, durations of the location requests, the desired accuracy the app specified in CoreLocation API, and the achieved accuracy of the delivered locations.

- Territories: Worldwide

- Platforms: iOS, iPadOS. For more information about iOS and iPadOS, see the Platforms section in Data Completeness and Corrections.

- Availability:

  - Daily: Every day.

- History: On request, data is available beginning with iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4.

- Completeness: Data from devices that contribute to this report can arrive as late as 8 days after the date it generates on device. You can download recent data daily, but it might be incomplete, and data updates incrementally daily, until all late-arriving events are available.

- Privacy:

  - Includes data from users who have opted to share their data with Apple and developers.

  - Individual rows will only appear if they have a value of 5 or more.

- Data Context: You can analyze your data with additional context by comparing it with the data in the App Sessions Context report, which provides a count of unique devices that use your app on a specific day. For example, if your app performed an action detailed in this report on 10 unique devices on a specific day, and the App Sessions Context report shows there were 100 unique devices running your app that day, then you can approximate that 10% of the devices running your app performed that action.
