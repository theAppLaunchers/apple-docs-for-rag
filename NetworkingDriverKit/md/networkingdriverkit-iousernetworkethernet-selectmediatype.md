Instance Method

# SelectMediaType

Selects the media type to use when communicating with the network stack.

DriverKit

``` source
kern_return_t SelectMediaType(IOUserNetworkMediaType mediaType);
```

## Parameters 

`mediaType`  

The media type to use for network communication. This type must be one that you declared previous when calling the ReportAvailableMediaTypes method.

## Return Value

`kIOReturnSuccess` on success, or another value if an error occurred.

## Discussion

Override this method and use it to configure your driver for the specified media type. In your implementation, validate the requested media type and make any adjustments as needed. For example, if the `mediaType` parameter is kIOUserNetworkMediaEthernetAuto, you might choose an explicit media type instead. After validating the type, configure your driver for that type and call the ReportLinkStatus method to report the driverâ€™s status back to the system.
