The MAC address of the hardware your driver supports.

`pool`  

The buffer pool you use to store incoming and outgoing packets.

`queues`  

An array containing the four queues you use to process incoming and outgoing network packets. This array must contain one queue each of types IOUserNetworkRxSubmissionQueue, IOUserNetworkRxCompletionQueue, IOUserNetworkTxSubmissionQueue, and IOUserNetworkTxCompletionQueue. The order of the queues in the array doesnâ€™t matter.
