## Discussion

Events represent a user controlling playback or a natural transition at the end of a piece of content. The client handles playback controls, such as pausing and resuming, then sends these event reports to your service.

To customize which controls are available during playback of a piece of Content, set its `control` property to a scheme you define in QueueControlMapping.

Note

The like and dislike events above indicate when the user presses a corresponding control. These are separate from the user telling Siri they like or dislike some content, which the client reports to the Process an Update Media Affinity Intent endpoint.
