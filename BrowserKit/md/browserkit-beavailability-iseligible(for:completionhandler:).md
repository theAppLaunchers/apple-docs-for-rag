)
```

class func isEligible(for context: BEAvailability.Context) async throws -> Bool

`completionHandler`  

A closure that receives the result of the eligibility check, and an error if any occurs.

## Discussion

The completion handler in the synchronous version of this method receives `true` as its first parameter if the device is eligible to run a version of the app that contains an alternative browser engine; otherwise, it receives `false`. The second parameter that the completion handler receives is an error if any occurs; otherwise, itâ€™s `nil`.

The `async` version of this method returns `true` if the device is eligible to run a version of the app that contains an alternative browser engine; otherwise, it returns `false`. The method throws an error if it encounters one.

To use the BEAvailability.Context.webBrowser context to test whether the device is eligible to use a web browser with an alternative browser engine, your app needs to have the com.apple.developer.web-browser entitlement. For information on adopting the web browser entitlement, see Preparing your app to be the default web browser.
