``` source
func DNSServiceCreateConnection(_ sdRef: UnsafeMutablePointer!) -> DNSServiceErrorType
```

## Parameters 

`sdRef`  

A pointer to an uninitialized DNSServiceRef. Deallocating the reference (via DNSServiceRefDeallocate(_:)) severs the connection and deregisters all records registered on this connection.

## Return Value

Returns kDNSServiceErr_NoError on success, otherwise returns an error code indicating the specific failure that occurred (in which case the DNSServiceRef is not initialized).
