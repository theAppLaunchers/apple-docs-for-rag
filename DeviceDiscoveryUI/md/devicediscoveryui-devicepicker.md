Structure

# DevicePicker

A SwiftUI view that displays other devices on the network, and creates an encrypted connection to a copy of your app running on that device.

``` source
@MainActor @preconcurrency
struct DevicePicker where Label : View, Fallback : View
```

## Mentioned in 

Connecting a tvOS app to other devices over the local network

## Overview

Always display the picker as a full-screen, modal view. If the user selects a device, the system calls the closure you passed as the `onSelect` parameter. If the user cancels the picker, it silently closes.

```
DevicePicker(
    .applicationService(name: "MyAppService")) { endpoint in
        myDeviceManager.connectTo(endpoint: endpoint)
    } label: {
        Text("Connect to a local device.")
    } fallback: {
        Text("Not supported.")
    } parameters: {
        // This example uses the default application services parameters;
        // however, you can add a NWProtocolFramer to provide application-level
        // messaging.
        .applicationService
    }
```

If the current device doesnâ€™t support device discovery, the system displays the fallback view instead of the device picker. Use the DevicePickerSupportedAction environment value to check whether the current device supports device discovery.

```
struct SettingsView: View {

    @Environment{\.devicePickerSupports} var myDevicePickerSupports
    @Binding var showDevicePicker: Bool

    var body: some View {
        if myDevicePickerSupports(.applicationService("MyAppService"),
                                  parameters: { .applicationService }) {
            Button("Select A Device") {
                // Display a device picker.
                showDevicePicker = true
            }
        }
    }
}
```
