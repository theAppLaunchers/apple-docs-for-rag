## Discussion

When the system calls this method, the app updates any displayed highlights to match the updated list. Only the highlights provided by the system should have a shared indication. If no highlights are in the list, the app should remove any links previously indicated.

The array is a priority-ordered list, where the first element in the array is the most relevant to the user. The list of provided highlights is empty if there are no highlights or if the user hasnâ€™t given permission for the app to display highlights.
