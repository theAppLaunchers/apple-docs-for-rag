## Overview

The system doesnâ€™t expose the identities of the contacts to the app. It tracks shared universal links for the current user and determines which links to elevate for consumption in an app. When the system deems a link to be useful, it surfaces that link to the hosting app in the form of an `SWHighlight` object.
