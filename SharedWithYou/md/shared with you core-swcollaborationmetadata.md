Adding shared content collaboration to your app

## Overview

Use `SWCollaborationMetadata` to share content without using iCloud. The system wraps the metadata object in an NSItemProvider object to implement a custom collaboration infrastructure.

If your app uses SwiftUI, `SWCollaborationMetadata` is compatible with the Transferable protocol and the ShareLink view.
