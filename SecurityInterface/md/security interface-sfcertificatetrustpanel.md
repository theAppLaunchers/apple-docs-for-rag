## Overview

The following figure shows an example of a certificate trust panel.

You can use this class to enable a user to make trust decisions when one or more certificates required for an operation are invalid or cannot be verified.

To display a certificate in a panel or sheet without editable trust settings, use the SFCertificatePanel class. To display certificates in a custom view, use the SFCertificateView class.
