# Revoking API Keys

Revoke unused, lost, or compromised private keys.

## Overview

Revoke an API key immediately if it becomes inactive, lost, or compromised. A revoked API key denies access to the Enterprise Program API on your organization’s behalf.

Important

Once you revoke an API key, you can’t reinstate it. Revoked keys are displayed for 30 days on the Integrations page under the Revoked heading.
