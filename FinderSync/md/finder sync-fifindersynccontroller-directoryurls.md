Instance Property

# directoryURLs

The directories managed by this extension.

macOS 10.10+

``` source
var directoryURLs: Set! { get set }
```

## Discussion

The extension receives beginObservingDirectory(at:) and endObservingDirectory(at:) messages for every directory in this set and for all of their subdirectories.

Always set `directoryURLs` when the extension starts. If there are no directories to watch, set `directoryURLs` to an empty set.
