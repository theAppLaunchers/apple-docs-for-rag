Function

# compression_stream_process(\_:\_:)

Performs compression or decompression using an initialized compression stream structure.

``` source
func compression_stream_process(
    _ stream: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ flags: Int32
) -> compression_status
```

## Parameters 

`stream`  

A pointer to an allocated and fully initialized compression_stream structure.

`flags`  

A constant of type compression_stream_flags; this should be COMPRESSION_STREAM_FINALIZE if there is no further input data, or `0` otherwise.

### Return Value

A value of type compression_status, interpreted as follows:

- COMPRESSION_STATUS_OK means that processing was successful, but the stream may produce more output. Call the function again with updated parameters.

- COMPRESSION_STATUS_END means that processing was successful, and the stream will produce no more output (this only occurs if `flags` is set to COMPRESSION_STREAM_FINALIZE).

- COMPRESSION_STATUS_ERROR means an error occurred.

## Discussion

Each time compression_stream_process(_:_:) is called successfully, the function consumes data from the source buffer and writes data into the destination buffer, until it reaches the end of one of the buffers and returns either COMPRESSION_STATUS_OK or COMPRESSION_STATUS_END.

After a successful call, the function updates the buffer parameters in the stream object: the function increments `src_ptr` (and decrements `src_size`) by the number of input bytes consumed. Likewise, the function incremets `dst_ptr` (and decrements `dst_size`) by the number of output bytes produced. The sum (`src_ptr + src_size`) remains unchanged, and so does (`dst_ptr + dst_size`). At this point, either `src_size` or `dst_size` will be 0, indicating that the source buffer is empty or the destination buffer is full.

If the source buffer is empty, you can refill it with more data and adjust the parameters, or point to a different buffer for the next call. If you donâ€™t provide any more input data, set `flags` to COMPRESSION_STREAM_FINALIZE and call again.

If the destination buffer is full and the return value is not COMPRESSION_STATUS_END, there may still be input available for processing. To let this happen, you might grow the buffer, move the pointer back to reuse the buffer, or point to a new destination buffer, and then call again.
