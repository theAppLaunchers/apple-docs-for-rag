## Discussion

The Compression library implements the LZMA encoder at level 6 only. This is the default compression level for open source LZMA, and provides excellent compression. The LZMA decoder supports decoding data compressed with any compression level.

The Compression library only supports LZMA2 thatâ€™s embedded in the XZ container. LZMA2 is a resource-restricted and extended variant of LZMA.
