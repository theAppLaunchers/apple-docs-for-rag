Function

# compression_encode_buffer(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Compresses the contents of a source buffer into a destination buffer.

``` source
func compression_encode_buffer(
    _ dst_buffer: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ dst_size: Int,
    _ src_buffer: UnsafePointer,
    _ src_size: Int,
    _ scratch_buffer: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?,
    _ algorithm: compression_algorithm
) -> Int
```

## Parameters 

`dst_buffer`  

Pointer to the buffer that receives the compressed data.

`dst_size`  

Size of the destination buffer in bytes.

`src_buffer`  

Pointer to a buffer containing all of the source data.

`src_size`  

Size of the data in the source buffer in bytes.

`scratch_buffer`  

If `scratch_buffer` is not `nil`, this parameter is a pointer to a buffer that the function uses for scratch purposes. The size of this buffer must be at least the size returned by a previous call to compression_encode_scratch_buffer_size(_:).

If `scratch_buffer` is nil, the function creates and manages its own scratch space, but with a possible performance hit.

`algorithm`  

Set to the desired algorithm: COMPRESSION_LZ4, COMPRESSION_ZLIB, COMPRESSION_LZMA, or COMPRESSION_LZFSE.

## Return Value

The number of bytes written to the destination buffer after compressing the input. If the funtion canâ€™t compress the entire input to fit into the provided destination buffer, or an error occurs, 0 is returned.

## Discussion

If the input is successfully compressed, the function writes the compressed data to dst_buffer.
