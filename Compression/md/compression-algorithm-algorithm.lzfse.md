## Discussion

LZFSE is Appleâ€™s proprietary compression algorithm, matching the compression ratio of zlib level 5, but with much higher energy efficiency and speed (between 2x and 3x) for both encode and decode operations.

Use LZFSE when compressing a payload for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. If you need to compress a payload for another platform (for example, Linux or Windows), use LZ4, LZMA, or zlib.
