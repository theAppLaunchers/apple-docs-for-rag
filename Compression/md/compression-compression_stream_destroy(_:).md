``` source
func compression_stream_destroy(_ stream: UnsafeMutablePointer) -> compression_status
```

## Parameters 

`stream`  

A pointer to an allocated and initialized compression_stream structure.

### Return Value

A value of type compression_status, interpreted as follows:

- COMPRESSION_STATUS_OK means that the function successfully destroyed the stream.

- COMPRESSION_STATUS_ERROR means an error occurred.

## Discussion

Note that compression_stream_destroy(_:) doesnâ€™t free the stream object or the buffers allocated by the caller.
