# About the EXT-X-VERSION tag

Find the protocol version that corresponds with the HLS features your app supports.

## Overview

The `EXT-X-VERSION` tag indicates the compatibility version of the Playlist file. This file, its associated media, and its server must comply with all provisions of the IETF Internet-Draft of HTTP Live Streaming 2nd Edition (or earlier specifications) describing the protocol version indicated by the tag value. A Playlist file that doesn’t contain an `EXT-X-VERSION` tag must comply with version 1 of this protocol. Support for M3U8 Playlists was introduced with iOS 3.0, Mac OS X 10.6, and Safari 4.

### High-level features

| EXT-X-VERSION | Features and usage notes |

| 5 | `KEYFORMAT` and `KEYFORMATVERSIONS` attributes of the `EXT-X-KEY` tag. The `EXT-X-MAP` tag. `SUBTITLES` media type. `SAMPLE-AES` encryption method `EXT-X-KEY` |
| 6 | `CLOSED-CAPTIONS` media type. Allow` EXT-X-MAP` for subtitle playlists |

| 8 | `EXT-X-GAP`, `EXT-X-DEFINE`, Variable Substitution, `VIDEO-RANGE` attribute. |
| 9 | `EXT-X-SKIP` |
| 10 | `EXT-X-SERVER-CONTROL`, `EXT-X-PART-INF`, `EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT`, `EXT-X-RENDITION-REPORT`, the `CUE` attribute of `EXT-X-DATERANGE`, the `STABLE-RENDITION-ID` of `EXT-X-MEDIA`, the `SUPPLEMENTAL-CODECS` attribute of `EXT-X-STREAM-INF`, and the `SCORE` and `STABLE-VARIANT-ID` attributes of `EXT-X-STREAM-INF` and `EXT-X-I-FRAME-STREAM-INF` tags |
| 11 | `QUERYPARAM` attribute of `EXT-X-DEFINE` |
| 12 | Attributes starting with ‘`REQ-`’ |

### Backward compatibility

Important

Older clients ignore backward-compatible features and will still play back the content in some form. Specify only the protocol version that’s required for backward compatibility in a given feature. For example, you don’t have to specify protocol version 5 if you’ve just added SUBTITLES.

The following features aren’t backward compatible. Older clients may fail to play the content if you use these features but don’t specify the protocol version where they were introduced:

- You must use at least protocol version 2 if you have `IV` in `EXT-X-KEY`.

- You must use at least protocol version 3 if you have floating point `EXTINF` duration values.

- You must use at least protocol version 4 if you have `EXT-X-BYTERANG`E or `EXT-X-IFRAME-ONLY`.

- You must use at least protocol version 5 if you specify the `SAMPLE-AES` encryption method in `EXT-X-KEY`, or if you have `KEYFORMAT` and `KEYFORMATVERSIONS` attributes in `EXT-X-KEY`, or if you have `EXT-X-MAP`.

- You must use at least protocol version 6 if you have `EXT-X-MAP` in a Media Playlist that does not contain `EXT-X-I-FRAMES-ONLY`.

- You must use at least protocol version 7 if you specify `SERVICE`***n*** values for the `INSTREAM-ID` attribute of `EXT-X-MEDIA`.

- You must use at least protocol version 8 if you use variable substitution.

- You must use at least protocol version 9 if you have `EXT-X-SKIP`.

- You must use at least protocol version 10 if you have `EXT-X-SKIP` that replaces `EXT-X-DATERANGE` tags in a Playlist Delta Update.

- You must use at least protocol version 11 if you have `QUERYPARAM` attribute in `EXT-X-DEFINE`.

- You must use at least protocol version 12 if you have attributes that start with “`REQ-`”.

### Specifications

The following tables list the versions of specifications where specific features are described, along with the corresponding iOS release that supports those features.

Note

Over time, HLS has been described by different documents: draft-pantos-http-live-streaming, which became RFC 8216, and now draft-pantos-hls-rfc8216bis.
