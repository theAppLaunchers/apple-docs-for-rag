``` source
class CXSetGroupCallAction
```

## Overview

CXSetGroupCallAction is a concrete subclass of CXCallAction. When the user or the system groups a call with another call, the provider sends provider(_:perform:) to its delegate. The providerâ€™s delegate calls the fulfill() method to indicate that the action was successfully performed. A group call allows more than two recipients to simultaneously communicate with one another.

## Topics
