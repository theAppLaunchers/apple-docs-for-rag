``` source
class CXAction
```

## Overview

Each instance of CXAction is uniquely identified by a uuid, which is generated on initialization. An action also tracks whether it has been completed or not.

To perform one or more actions, you add them to a new CXTransaction object and pass the transaction to an instance of CXCallController using the request(_:completion:) method. After each action is performed by the telephony provider, the providerâ€™s delegate calls either the fulfill() method, indicating that the action was successfully performed, or the fail() method, to indicate that an error occurred; both of these methods set the isComplete property of the action to true.

The CXCallAction subclass is an abstract class that represents an action associated with a CXCall object. The CallKit framework provides several concrete CXCallAction subclasses to represent actions such as answering a call and putting a call on hold.

## Topics

### Creating an Action

init()

Initializes a new telephony action.

init?(coder: NSCoder)

### Accessing Action Attributes

var uuid: UUID

The unique identifier for the action.

var isComplete: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the action has been performed by the provider.
