``` source
class CXEndCallAction
```

## Overview

CXEndCallAction is a concrete subclass of CXCallAction. When the user initiates an outgoing call, the provider sends provider(_:perform:) to its delegate. The providerâ€™s delegate calls the fulfill() method to indicate that the action was successfully performed. To indicate that the call ended at a time other than the current time, you can instead call the fulfill(withDateEnded:)
