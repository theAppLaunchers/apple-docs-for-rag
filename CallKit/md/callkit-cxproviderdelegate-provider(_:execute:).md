## Discussion

Most delegates should not need to provide an implementation for this method. However, a delegate can implement this method to customize how transactions are handled. This method returns true to indicate that the custom implementation handled the transaction and returns false to have the provider execute the transaction normallyâ€”as if the delegate did not implement this method. For example, given a transaction consisting of a CXSetHeldCallAction object and a CXSetGroupCallAction object, the delegate may override this method to inject a 30 second wait and play hold music to the caller.
