``` source
class CXAnswerCallAction
```

## Overview

CXAnswerCallAction is a concrete subclass of CXCallAction.

When an incoming call is allowed by the system and approved by the user, the provider sends provider(_:perform:) to its delegate. The providerâ€™s delegate calls the fulfill() method to indicate that the action was successfully performed. To indicate that the call connected at a time other than the current time, you can instead call the fulfill(withDateConnected:).
