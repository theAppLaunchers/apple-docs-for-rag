## Mentioned in 

Making and receiving VoIP calls

## Overview

A CXProvider object is responsible for reporting out-of-band notifications that occur to the system. A VoIP app should create only one instance of CXProvider and store it for use globally. A CXProvider object is initialized with a CXProviderConfiguration object to specify the behavior and capabilities of calls. Each provider can specify an object conforming to the CXProviderDelegate protocol to respond to events, such as the call starting, the call being put on hold, or the providerâ€™s audio session being activated.

### Subclassing Notes

CXProvider is not intended for subclassing.

### Accessing Provider Attributes

var configuration: CXProviderConfiguration

### Accessing Pending Transaction and Call Actions

var pendingTransactions: [CXTransaction]

Incomplete transactions.

func pendingCallActions(of: AnyClass, withCall: UUID) -> [CXCallAction]

Returns all call actions in any pending transactions of the specified class for the specified call identifier that are incomplete.

### Reporting Calls

func reportNewIncomingCall(with: UUID, update: CXCallUpdate, completion: ((any Error)?) -> Void)

Reports a new incoming call with the specified unique identifier to the provider.

class func reportNewIncomingVoIPPushPayload([AnyHashable : Any], completion: (((any Error)?) -> Void)?)

func reportOutgoingCall(with: UUID, startedConnectingAt: Date?)

Reports to the provider that an outgoing call with the specified unique identifier started connecting at a particular time.

func reportOutgoingCall(with: UUID, connectedAt: Date?)

Reports to the provider that an outgoing call with the specified unique identifier finished connecting at a particular time.

func reportCall(with: UUID, updated: CXCallUpdate)

Reports to the provider that an active call updated its information.

func reportCall(with: UUID, endedAt: Date?, reason: CXCallEndedReason)

Reports to the provider that a call with the specified identifier ended at a given date for a particular reason.

### Invalidating a Provider
