``` source
class CXSetMutedCallAction
```

## Overview

CXSetMutedCallAction is a concrete subclass of CXCallAction. When the user or the system mutes a call, the provider sends provider(_:perform:) to its delegate. The providerâ€™s delegate calls the fulfill() method to indicate that the action was successfully performed. When a caller mutes a call, that caller is unable to communicate with other callers until they unmute the call. A muted caller still receives communication from other unmuted callers.

## Topics
