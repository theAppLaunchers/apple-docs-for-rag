## Overview

The CallKit framework provides the following concrete CXCallAction subclasses.

| CXCallAction subclass | Description |
|----|----|
| CXAnswerCallAction | Answers an incoming call. |
| CXStartCallAction | Initiates an outgoing call. |
| CXEndCallAction | Ends a call. |
| CXSetHeldCallAction | Places a call on hold or removes a call from hold. |
| CXSetGroupCallAction | Groups a call with another call or removes a call from a group. |
| CXSetMutedCallAction | Mutes or unmutes a call. |
| CXPlayDTMFCallAction | Plays a DTMF (dual tone multifrequency) tone sequence on a call. |

To perform one or more actions, you add them to a new CXTransaction object and pass the transaction to an instance of CXCallController using the request(_:completion:) method. After each action is performed by the telephony provider, the providerâ€™s delegate calls either the CXCallAction method, indicating that the action was successfully performed, or the CXCallAction method, to indicate that an error occurred; both of these methods set the CXCallAction property of the action to true.
