## Overview

CXPlayDTMFCallAction is a concrete subclass of CXCallAction. Whenever digits are transmitted during a call, whether from a user interacting with a number pad or following a hard or soft pause, the provider sends provider(_:perform:) to its delegate. The providerâ€™s delegate calls the fulfill() method to indicate that the action was successfully performed.

The provider sends provider(_:perform:) for successive actions only after the current action is fulfilled. When interacting with the number pad, each entered digit constitutes its own action. Digits following a hard or soft pause, however, are passed to provider(_:perform:) as a single string of digits. For example, if a user taps the 4 button on the number pad, followed by the 2 button, the delegate is sent provider(_:perform:) for the digit `4` and waits for the action to be fulfilled; after the action is fulfilled, the delegate is sent provider(_:perform:) for the digit `2`.

CallKit automatically plays the corresponding DTMF frequencies for any digits transmitted over a call. The app is responsible for managing the timing and handling of digits as part of fulfilling the action.

## Topics

### Creating New Actions

init(call: UUID, digits: String, type: CXPlayDTMFCallAction.ActionType)

Initializes a new action for a call identified by a given UUID, as well as a specified type and sequence of digits.

init?(coder: NSCoder)
