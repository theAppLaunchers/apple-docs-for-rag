Class

# SMAppService

An object the framework uses to control helper executables that live inside an appâ€™s main bundle.

Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+

``` source
class SMAppService
```

## Overview

In macOS 13 and later, use `SMAppService` to register and control `LoginItems`, `LaunchAgents`, and `LaunchDaemons` as helper executables for your app. When converting code from earlier versions of macOS, use an `SMAppService` object and select one of the following methods depending on the type of service your helper executable provides:

- For `SMAppServices` initialized as `LoginItems`, the register() and unregister() APIs provide a replacement for SMLoginItemSetEnabled(_:_:).

- For `SMAppServices` initialized as `LaunchAgents`, the register() and unregister() methods provide a replacement for installing property lists in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` or `/Library/LaunchAgents`.

- For `SMAppServices` initialized as `LaunchDaemons`, the register() and unregister() methods provide a replacement for installing property lists in `/Library/LaunchDaemons`.

func register() throws

Registers the service so it can begin launching subject to user approval.

func unregister() throws

Unregisters the service so the system no longer launches it.

func unregister(completionHandler: ((any Error)?) -> Void)

Unregisters the service so the system no longer launches it and calls a completion handler you provide with the resulting error value.

### Managing apps

class var mainApp: SMAppService

An app service object that corresponds to the main application as a login item.

class func agent(plistName: String) -> Self

Initializes an app service object with a launch agent with the property list name you provide.

class func daemon(plistName: String) -> Self

Initializes an app service object with a launch daemon with the property list name you provide.

class func loginItem(identifier: String) -> Self

Initializes an app service object for a login item corresponding to the bundle with the identifier you provide.

### Interacting with System Settings

class func openSystemSettingsLoginItems()

Opens System Settings to the Login Items control panel.

### Getting the state of the service

var status: SMAppService.Status
