# Updating your app package installer to use the new Service Management API

Learn about the Service Management API with a GUI-less agent app.

macOS 13.0+Xcode 15.0+

## Overview

This sample code project demonstrates how to structure your app package installer and use the new Service Management APIs. The sample project places the helper executable’s `launchd` property lists in the helper executable’s bundle, rather than relying on shared locations like `/Library/LaunchDaemons`. The advantages of this approach include containing your `LaunchDaemon` and `LaunchAgent` property lists in a fully codesigned app bundle that neither the system nor a third party can modify without breaking the code signature. Users can also see which app is providing the launch daemons or launch agents by choosing System Settings \> General \> Login Items.

This sample project contains three targets:

- `SampleLaunchAgent`, which builds a sample `LaunchAgent` helper executable.

- `SMAppServiceSampleCode`, which builds a GUI-less app that contains the sample launch agent binary property list and an executable to register the agent at install time.

- `SMAppServiceSamplePackage`, which builds the `SMAppServiceSample.pkg` installer you use to install the `SampleLaunchAgent` helper executable.

In addition to demonstrating the new package structure, this sample demonstrates the APIs for registering helper executables. To register a launch agent, the sample creates an agent object, `SMAppService.agent(plistName:)` and then calls `register()`.

```
let service = SMAppService.agent(plistName: "com.xpc.example.agent.plist")

do {
   try service.register()
   print("Successfully registered \(service)")
} catch {
   print("Unable to register \(error)")
   exit(1)
}
```

To unregister a launch agent, the sample creates an agent object, `SMAppService.agent(plistName:)` and then calls `unregister()`.

```
let service = SMAppService.agent(plistName: "com.xpc.example.agent.plist")

do {
   try service.unregister()
   print("Successfully unregistered \(service)")
} catch {
   print("Unable to unregister \(error)")
   exit(1)
}
```

To determine the authorization state of a launch agent, the sample creates an agent object, `SMAppService.agent(plistName:)` and then calls `status()` to determine the helper executable’s authorization state.

```
let service = SMAppService.agent(plistName: "com.xpc.example.agent.plist")

print("\(service) has status \(service.status)")
```

### Configure the sample code project

To set the Team ID for the sample app and package targets, follow these steps:

1.  Open `SMAppServiceSampleCode.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

2.  Select the `SMAppServiceSampleCode` target from the project editor.

3.  Click Signing & Capabilities.

4.  Choose your team from the Team pop-up menu.

5.  Select the `SMAppServiceSamplePackage` from the project editor and repeat step 4.

### Build the sample app service

1.  Open Terminal and change to the directory into which you downloaded the `UpdatingYourAppPackageInstallerToUseTheNewServiceManagementAPI` source code.

2.  Run the command `xcodebuild -target SMAppServiceSamplePackage`.

Xcode builds the `SMAppServiceSamplePackage` installer package, and the process concludes with Xcode printing `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **` to the terminal.

Important

When building your own projects, follow the packaging steps in the `generatePackage.zsh` script to generate a correctly configured installer package.

### Install the login item and launch agent

1.  In Terminal, navigate to the `build/Release` directory using the command `cd build/Release`.

2.  Open the build directory in Finder with the command `open .`.

3.  The Finder window contains all the products that the Xcode build process creates, including a package installer named `SMAppServiceSample`. Double-click the installer icon to run it, and follow the instructions to approve the installation of the `SMAppServiceSampleCode` login item and its supporting `SampleLaunchAgent` helper executable.

### Run the sample launch agent

The installer adds a new login item in System Settings and installs the sample launch agent `SampleLaunchAgent` in the directory `/Library/Application Support/YOURDEVELOPERNAME`. Run the `SampleLaunchAgent` executable from the Terminal by invoking the command line app inside the app bundle with an additional command argument:

`/Library/Application Support/YOURDEVELOPERNAME/SMAppServiceSampleCode.app/Contents/MacOS/SMAppServiceSampleCode COMMAND`

The `SMAppServiceSampleCode` app supports the following commands:

- `register` — Registers the `SampleLaunchAgent`.

- `unregister` — Unregisters the `SampleLaunchAgent`.

- `status` — Checks the authorization status of the `SampleLaunchAgent`.

- `test` — Sends an XPC message to the `SampleLaunchAgent` and displays the reply.

The output from the app resembles the following, for each of the app’s commands:

```
```

Running the app before registering the service, or after unregistering the service, results in an error.

```
```

### Uninstall the login item and launch agent

To uninstall the sample app’s login item from System Settings, as well as the `SampleLaunchAgent`, use the following command:

`sudo rm -rf /Library/Application Support/YOURDEVELOPERNAME`

The login item may remain visible in the System Settings \> General \> Login Items for some time. This is expected because the system removes deleted items as part of its maintenance processes overnight. To remove all third-party login items and reset the System Settings \> General \> Login Items to its installation defaults, use the `sfltool`: `sudo sfltool resetbtm`.
