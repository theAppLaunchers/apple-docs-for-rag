Detecting nudity in media and providing intervention options

## Discussion

If analysisPolicy is this value, it indicates that the user enables both of the following:

- Communication Safety parental control in Screen Time

- Sensitive Content Warnings in your appâ€™s settings

When your app detects nudity under this policy, your app needs to:

- Use child-appropriate language, such as broadly understood vocabulary

- Present an alert that fills the full screen.

- Intervene on the receipt of sensitve content over a network and before transmitting sensitive content over a network.
