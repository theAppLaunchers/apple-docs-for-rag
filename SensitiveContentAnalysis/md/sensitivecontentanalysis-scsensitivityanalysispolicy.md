// Check the current analysis policy. 
let policy = analyzer.analysisPolicy
if policy == .disabled { return } 
else if policy == .simpleInterventions {
    // The Sensitive Content Warning setting is active.
} else if policy == .descriptiveInterventions {
    // The Communication Safety setting is active.
}
```
