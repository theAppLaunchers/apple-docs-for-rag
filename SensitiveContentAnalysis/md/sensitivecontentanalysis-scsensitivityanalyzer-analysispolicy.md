Detecting nudity in media and providing intervention options

## Discussion

Before attempting to use the framework, first check the analysisPolicy:

```
let policy = analyzer.analysisPolicy
if policy == .disabled { return }
```

An app can utilize the SensitiveContentAnalysis framework when the system sets the value of this property to either:

- SCSensitivityAnalysisPolicy.simpleInterventions, which indicates that a user activates the Communication Safety parental control in Screen Time.

- SCSensitivityAnalysisPolicy.descriptiveInterventions, which indicates that the user activates the Sensitive Content Warning user preference.

The framework wonâ€™t detect nudity if the system disables this property. For more information on why the system disables sensitive content analysis, see SCSensitivityAnalysisPolicy.disabled.
