## Discussion

MDM doesnâ€™t support AirPlay destinations that have enabled Onscreen Codes. Provide either the `DestinationName` or the `DestinationDeviceID`. If you provide both values, MDM uses `DestinationDeviceID`.

Refer to the following sections to determine supported channels and requirements, and to see an example request and response.
