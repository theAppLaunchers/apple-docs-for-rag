## Properties

`AppIDs`

`[string]`

An array of App IDs that specify apps that Enrollment SSO developer mode can use. In Enrollment SSO documents delivered through the developer endpoint, this key must be present and contain at least one value. In Enrollment SSO documents delivered by the standard Enrollment SSO endpoint, this key must not be present.

`AssociatedDomains`

`[string]`

An array of associated domains that the device uses with the Enrollment SSO extension.

`AssociatedDomainsEnableDirectDownloads`

`boolean`

If `true,` allows the domain to directly verify site association, instead of at Appleâ€™s servers. Use this verification only with domains that are inaccessible on the public Internet.

Default: `false`

`ConfigurationProfile`

`data`

The profile containing an ExtensibleSingleSignOn payload that specifies the SSO extension in the downloaded app prior to enrollment. This profile may contain certificate payloads.

`Declarations`

`[data]`

`iTunesStoreID`

`integer`

The iTunes Store ID of the app to download prior to enrollment, to support Enrollment SSO during enrollment. Using developer mode ignores this key.
