## Discussion

This command provides a more secure version of `InstallApplication` that specifies a `ManifestURL`. The request must contain either `Manifest` or `ManifestURL`. Using `Manifest` ignores the pinning options. When using `ManifestURL`, specify the pinning options to increase security. In macOS, the device returns an `Acknowledged` response after validating the parameters, but before downloading and installing the app. Howevever, it doesnâ€™t notify the MDM server about errors that occur during the installation process.
