## Properties

`MaximumVirtualDisplays`

`integer`

The maximum number of virtual displays to make available to clients.

Minimum: `0`

Maximum: `2`

`PortBase`

`integer`

The initial UDP port number to connect to the host. Screen sharing requires multiple connections, so the system increments this value by 1 for each additional connection. This doesnâ€™t change the port number that the system uses to initially establish a connection with a host, which is always TCP port 5900.

Minimum: `1024`

Maximum: `65535`

`PreventCopyFilesFromHost`

`boolean`

If `true`, the system prevents users from copying files from the screen-sharing host.

Default: `false`

`PreventCopyFilesToHost`

`boolean`

If `true`, the system prevents users from copying files to the screen-sharing host.

Default: `false`

`PreventHighPerformanceConnections`

`boolean`

If `true`, the system prevents clients from establishing high-performance connections to the host.

Default: `false`
