## Discussion

In iOS 11 and earlier, this command clears the restrictions password and all restrictions that the password protects.

In iOS 12.2 and later, if Screen Time uses iCloud to share its settings (Share Across Devices), this command disables Screen Time entirely and clears its restrictions. If the user is a child in an iCloud family, the command fails. Otherwise, if Screen Time isnâ€™t using iCloud, this command clears the passcode, but not the restrictions, and it leaves Screen Time enabled.
