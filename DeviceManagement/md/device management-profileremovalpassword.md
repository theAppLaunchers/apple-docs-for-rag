Specify `com.apple.profileRemovalPassword` as the payload type.

This payload provides a password to allow users to remove a locked configuration profile from the device. If this payload is present and has a password value set, the device asks for the password when the user taps a profileâ€™s Remove button. This system encrypts the payload with the rest of the profile.
