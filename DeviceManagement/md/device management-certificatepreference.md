# CertificatePreference

The payload you use to configure a certificate preference.

macOS 10.12+Device Assignment ServicesVPP License Management

``` source
object CertificatePreference
```

## Properties

`Name`

`string`

 (Required) 

An email address (in RFC 822 format) or other name for which a preferred certificate is requested.

`PayloadCertificateUUID`

`string`

 (Required) 

The UUID of the certificate payload within the same profile to use for the identity credential.

## Discussion

Specify `com.apple.security.certificatepreference` as the payload type.

A `CertificatePreference` payload lets you identify a certificate preference item in the userâ€™s keychain that references a certificate payload included in the same profile. It can only appear in a user profile, not a device profile. You can include multiple `CertificatePreference` payloads as needed.

See also IdentityPreference for information about setting up identity preferences.
