iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.1+Device Assignment ServicesVPP License Management

``` source
object LegacyInteractiveProfile
```

## Properties

`ProfileURL`

`string`

 (Required) 

The URL of the profile to download and install, which needs to start with `https://`. The system silently ignores any account or passcode payloads in the profile. Use their declarative configurations instead.

If a user enrollment triggers this configuration, the system silently ignores any MDM 1 payloads in macOS where the User Enrollment Mode setting is `forbidden`. In iOS, the system rejects the entire profile.

`VisibleName`

`string`

 (Required) 

The visible name of the configuration. This name needs to indicate the nature of the profile.

## Discussion

Specify `com.apple.configuration.legacy.interactive` as the declaration type.

This declaration specifies an MDM 1 profile to present to the user, who may choose to download and install the profile.

The declaration may contain any profile that MDM supports. The system doesnâ€™t allow MDM enrollment and Profile Services profiles.
