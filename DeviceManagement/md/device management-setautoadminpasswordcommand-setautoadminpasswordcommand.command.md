Device Management Command

# SetAutoAdminPasswordCommand.Command

The request dictionary to change the password of a local administrator account.

macOS 10.11+Device Assignment ServicesVPP License Management

``` source
object SetAutoAdminPasswordCommand.Command
```

## Properties

`GUID`

`string`

 (Required) 

The unique identifier of the local administrator account. If this value doesnâ€™t match the GUID of an administrator account that MDM created during Device Enrollment Program (DEP) enrollment, the command returns an error.

`passwordHash`

`data`

 (Required) 

The precreated salted SHA-512 PBKDF2 password hash for the account.

Create this hash on the server using the CommonCrypto libraries, or equivalent, as a salted SHA-512 PBKDF2 dictionary that contains these elements:

- `entropy`: The derived key from the password hash; for example, from `CCKeyDerivationPBKDF()`

- `salt`: The 32-byte randomized salt; for example, from `CCRandomCopyBytes()`

- `iterations:` The number of iterations; for example, from `CCCalibratePBKDF()` using a minimum hash time of 100 milliseconds, or if unknown, a number in the range of 20,000 to 40,000 iterations

Place the dictionary that contains these elements into an outer dictionary with the key `SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2`. Convert this dictionary to binary data before setting it as the value for `passwordHash`.

`RequestRequiresNetworkTether`

`boolean`

If `true`, the device must be network-tethered to run the command.

Default: `false`

`RequestType`

`string`

 (Required) 

The request type to change the password of a local administrator account.

Value: `SetAutoAdminPassword`
