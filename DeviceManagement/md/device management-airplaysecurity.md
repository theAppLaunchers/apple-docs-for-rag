Possible Values: `ANY, WIFI_ONLY`

`Password`

`string`

The AirPlay password; required if `SecurityType` is `PASSWORD`.

`SecurityType`

`string`

 (Required) 

The security policy for AirPlay. Allowed values:

`PASSCODE_ONCE`  
Requires an onscreen passcode on first connection from a device. Subsequent connections from the same device arenâ€™t prompted.

`PASSCODE_ALWAYS`  
Requires an onscreen passcode for every AirPlay connection. After an AirPlay connection ends, the system allows reconnecting within 30 seconds without a password.

`PASSWORD`
