# Handling Error Responses

Investigate service request errors and troubleshoot solutions.

## Overview

When tasks for a service request result in a failure, you receive information about the failure either synchronously in the service response, or asynchronously in status endpoint responses or background notifications. The error information resides in the `ErrorResponse` objects. An ErrorResponse object contains two fields: an `errorNumber` field and an `errorMessage` field. In some cases, the `ErrorResponse` object also contains an `errorInfo` field with metadata about the failure for diagnostic purposes. Any `errorMessage` value uniquely maps to an `errorNumber` value, but not the other way around.

### Handle Synchronous Error Responses

When a service request results in a synchronous failure, the response is itself an ErrorResponse object containing an `errorMessage` and `errorNumber`.

Important

Synchronous failures result in no asynchronous processing.

In addition to the response body, the HTTP status code provides information about the nature of the failure.

```
{
    "errorNumber": 9726,
    "errorMessage": "This request contains an unsupported HTTP method for the requested endpoint."
}
```

### Handle Retry-After Headers

For HTTP 5xx server error responses, a `Retry-After` header indicates how long the client must wait before making additional requests.

The header for a 2-minute wait resembles the following:

```
Retry-After: 120
```

If notifications for an event are missing, use Event Status to verify that the event’s state is not pending. Then trigger a sync with either Get Assets or Get Users to sync the changes since the request.

### Handle Error Responses in Status

If a task for a submitted service request fails while processing in the background, the status endpoint for that task provides information about the failure. The status endpoint includes a `failures` field with a value that is an array of `ErrorResponse` objects.

```
{
    "eventStatus": "FAILED",
    "eventType": "ASSOCIATE",
    "failures": [
        {
            "errorInfo": {
                "clientUserIds": [
                    "user102",
                    "user101"
                ]
            },
            "errorNumber": 9609,
            "errorMessage": "Unable to find registered user."
        }
    ],
    "numCompleted": 0,
    "numRequested": 2,
    "tokenExpirationDate": "2030-11-08T22:33:22+0000",
    "uId": "2049025000431439"
}
```

### Handle Error Responses in Notifications

If a task for a submitted service request fails while processing in the background, and if the MDM client that submits the request can receive notifications, the notification contains an ErrorResponse object with information about the failure and affected entities. A notification can have at most one `ErrorResponse` object in it (potentially affecting multiple entities).

```
{
    "notification": {
        "assignments": [
            {
                "adamId": "1234",
                "pricingParam": "STDQ",
                "serialNumber": "device1"
            },
            {
                "adamId": "1234",
                "pricingParam": "STDQ",
                "clientUserId": "user1"
            }
        ],
        "error": {
            "errorMessage": "There aren't enough assets available to complete this association.",
            "errorNumber": 9709
        },
        "eventId": "f743928c-cc93-4a17-a53f-50c552ce1e06",
        "result": "FAILURE",
        "type": "ASSOCIATE"
    },
    "notificationId": "eba66-1bc1-4285-aa0a-7256293c5ca7",
    "notificationType": "ASSET_MANAGEMENT",
    "uId": "2049025000431439"
}
```

Error Codes for Asynchronous Failures

The server may return these error codes in either StatusResponse or in background notifications.

|----|----|
| 9603 | Internal error. |
| 9609 | Unable to find registered user. |
| 9709 | There aren’t enough assets available to complete this association. |

Important

The server may add additional error codes in the future.
