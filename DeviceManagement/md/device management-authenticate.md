`OK`

## Discussion

On success, the server must respond with a `200 OK` status. The server shouldnâ€™t assume that the device has installed the MDM payload at this time, as other payloads in the profile may still fail to install. When the device has successfully installed the MDM payload, it sends a Token Update message.
