# Getting App and Book Information (Legacy)

Use a web service to find details about apps and books to show to your users.

## Overview

To provide users with metadata for the apps and books that they’re managing, such as artwork, the `contentMetadataLookup` url in the Service Config response allows an MDM server to query the store for app and book metadata.

### Perform a Lookup

The URL query string tells the content metadata lookup service which app or book to look up. You must use a `GET` HTTP method for this request.

The platform filters the content, and the useful values for the `platform` query parameter are:

```
- term `enterprisestore`: For apps in the enterprise store
- term `volumestore`: For apps in the educational store
```

For example, to get B2B app content, append `platform`=`enterprisestore` to your query string.

The following is an example of the URL to look up an app:

`https://uclient-api.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStorePlatform.woa/wa/lookup?version=2&id=361309726&p=mdm-lockup&caller=MDM&platform=enterprisestore&cc=us&l=en`

A typical response looks like the following:

```

### Authenticate for Custom Apps

If the MDM client includes the organization’s `sToken` in the request as a cookie, an MDM server can get authenticated app metadata for B2B apps that the organization owns, as well as apps that users can still redownload, but no longer purchase.

You must include the organization’s `sToken` as a cookie named `itvt` to access the authenticated metadata.

The following is an example of the request with the added cookie:

```
curl --location --request GET 'https://uclient-api.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStorePlatform.woa/wa/lookup?version=2&id=451796775&p=mdm-lockup&caller=MDM&platform=enterprisestore&cc=us&l=en' \
 --cookie "itvt={sToken}"
```

A typical response looks like the following:

```

The `isAuthenticated` field is always `false`. To verify proper authentication, check the `results` field for content. An empty `results` set means one of the following:

- The user doesn’t have access to the queried app or book.

- The provided `id` isn’t valid.

- Authentication failed.

The `watchBundleID` key indicates that the app runs on Apple Watch. The value is the watch’s bundle identifier, which can differ from the main bundle identifier that the iPhone it’s paired with uses.

When the `results` set is empty, a typical response looks like the following:

```
{
    "isAuthenticated": false,
    "meta": {
        "language": {
            "tag": "en-us"
        },
        "storefront": {
            "cc": "US",
            "id": "143441"
        }
    },
    "results": {},
    "version": 2
}
```

### Identify Universal Apps

When an MDM client queries the store for an app, it may need to determine whether the app is universal so it can assess what devices it can assign the app to.

To make this determination, an MDM client looks for the following two fields:

```
- term `deviceFamilies`: Supported device families
- term `kind`: Type of content
```

A universal app lists `mac` in `deviceFamilies` and has `kind` equal to `iosSoftware`.

Use `platform=macappstore` in your query string to retrieve Mac specific metadata when using `contentMetadataLookup.`

By default, using `platform=enterprisestore` or `platform=volumestore` returns iOS metadata for an app designed for iPad on a Mac with M1 or M2.

The following is an example of a typical response from an app designed for iPad on a Mac with M1 or M2:

```
{
    "results": {
        "640199958": {
            ...
            "deviceFamilies": [
                "mac",.
                "tvos",
                "iphone",
                "ipad",
                "ipod"            
            ],
            ...
            "kind": "iosSoftware",
            ...
        }
    },
    "version": 1,
    "isAuthenticated": false,
    "meta": {
        "storefront": {
            "id": "143441",

        },
        "language": {
            "tag": "en-us"
        }
    }
}
```
