## Properties

`DNSSettings`

DNSSettings.DNSSettings

 (Required) 

A dictionary that defines a configuration for an encrypted DNS server.

`OnDemandRules`

`[`DNSSettings.OnDemandRulesElement`]`

An array of rules that define the DNS settings. If not set, the system always applies the DNS settings. These rules are identical to the `OnDemandRules` array in VPN payloads.

`PayloadCertificateUUID`

`string`

The UUID that points to an identity certificate payload. The system uses this identity to authenticate the user to the DNS resolver.

`ProhibitDisablement`

`boolean`

If `true`, the system prohibits users from disabling DNS settings. This key is only available on supervised devices.

Default: `false`

## Discussion

Specify `com.apple.dnsSettings.managed` as the payload type.

When installed from an MDM, the setting only applies to managed wifi networks

When installed manually, this setting also applies to cellular.
