Provides information about courses, sorted in lexical order by a course `source_system_identifier`. The organization must provide this identifier to Apple.

`cursor`

`string`

A hex string that should be used for the next request to paginate. This field data type has a maximum length of 512 UTF-8 characters.

`more_to_follow`

`boolean`

Indicates whether the requestâ€™s limit and cursor values resulted in only a partial list of classes. If true, the MDM server should then make another request (starting from the newly returned cursor) to obtain additional records.
