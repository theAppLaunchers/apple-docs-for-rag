## Discussion

Specify `com.apple.google-oauth` as the payload type.

You can install multiple Google payloads. Each sets up a Google email address and any other Google services the user enables after authentication.

Note

For supervised devices, the system requires installation of Google accounts through MDM or Apple Configurator 2.

The payload never contains credentials; the system prompts the user to enter credentials shortly after installation of the payload.
