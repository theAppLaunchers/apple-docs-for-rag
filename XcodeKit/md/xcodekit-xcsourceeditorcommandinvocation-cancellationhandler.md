Instance Property

# cancellationHandler

A handler to be invoked by Xcode to indicate that the invocation has been canceled by the user.

macOS 10.12+

``` source
var cancellationHandler: () -> Void { get set }
```

## Discussion

There are no guarantees about the thread or queue on which the cancellation handler is invoked. After receiving a cancellation, the commandâ€™s `completionHandler` is invoked and no changes are applied.
