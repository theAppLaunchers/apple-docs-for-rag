The unique identifier of the article.

`isCandidateToBeFeatured`

A Boolean value that indicates whether this article should be considered for featuring in Apple News.

Default value: `false`

`isPreview`

`boolean`

A Boolean value that indicates whether this article should be public (live) or should be a preview that’s only visible to members of your channel. Set `isPreview` to `false` to publish the article immediately and make it visible to all News users.

If your channel hasn’t been approved to publish articles in Apple News Format, setting `isPreview` to `false` results in an `ONLY_PREVIEW_ALLOWED` error.

Default value: `true` if your channel hasn’t yet been approved to publish articles in Apple News Format; `false` if your channel has been approved.

`isSponsored`

`boolean`

A Boolean value that indicates whether this article consists of sponsored content for promotional purposes. You must mark sponsored content as such; channels that don’t follow this policy may be suspended.

When using `isSponsored`, if you don’t want the sponsored article to appear in your channel’s feed, set sections to `[]` (an empty array).

Default value: `false`

`links`

ArticleLinksResponse

The URL of the channel in which the article appears.

`maturityRating`

`string`

A string value that indicates the viewing audience for the content. The types of audiences or ratings are `KIDS`, `MATURE`, and `GENERAL,` or `null` if unspecified. A `MATURE` rating indicates explicit content that’s only appropriate for a specific audience.

Default value: `null`

Possible Values: `KIDS, MATURE, GENERAL`
