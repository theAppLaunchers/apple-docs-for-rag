# Text Styles

Learn about text styles and how to apply them to your text and text components.

## Overview

With Apple News Format, you can determine every detail about the appearance of your text, from fonts to special effects. Here are some of the things you can do with text styles:

- Choose a font. Choose a font family from more than 60 supported iOS fonts. See Applying Apple News Format Fonts.

- Define font specifics. Select a font weight (from thin to extra bold), as well as a font size, height, width, and style. You can also set the amount of spacing between characters (called *tracking*).

- Add embellishments. Use underlining or other text effects, such as strikethrough and shadow.

- Align text. Use vertical and horizontal alignments to position your text exactly where you want within the component.

- Add drop caps. Use a drop cap to emphasize the beginning of an article or chapter.

- Adjust indentation. Use first-line or hanging indentation on the paragraphs in your article.
