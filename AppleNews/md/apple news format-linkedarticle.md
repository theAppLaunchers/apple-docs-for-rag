```

## Properties

`relationship`

`string`

 (Required) 

The type of relationship between the article and the linked document.

Valid values:

- `related`. The linked article is an article on the same topic, part of the same dossier, or provides more information about the subjects discussed.

- `promoted`. The linked article isnâ€™t directly related, but deserves additional promotion because the article covers another important topic. This value also puts the article at the top of the channel feed.

Possible Values: `related, promoted`

`URL`

`uri`

 (Required) 

The URL for the link, which can be either an Apple News link, like `https://apple.news/[article_id]`, or a link to an article on your website, if the website link matches the `canonicalURL` metadata property of the linked article. For more information about `canonicalURL`, see Metadata.

## Discussion

You can control lists of links that people see in articles by using the `links` array in Metadata. If you are linking to a sponsored article, ensure that the Create an Article request uses the `isSponsored` flag.
