## Discussion

`Article Document.textStyles` is an object containing the text style objects that components in your article can refer to inline from their text, using HTML or Markdown. See Using HTML with Apple News Format and Using Markdown with Apple News Format. You can also refer to these text style objects in an InlineTextStyle object within a component.

You provide each component layout object as a key-value pair. In each pair, you create a key thatâ€™s meaningful to you. The value of each pair is a TextStyle object.
