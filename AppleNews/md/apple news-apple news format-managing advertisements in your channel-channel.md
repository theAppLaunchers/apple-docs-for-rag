# Managing Advertisements in Your Channel

Set the layout and frequency of ads automatically inserted in an article.

## Overview

Apple News places ads in any of the following locations:

- Between two `body` components

- Between two paragraphs inside a `body` component

- Between containers

- After the last component — even if the article is shorter than one screen

Ads can’t appear in these locations:

- Between anchored components

- In the first screen of an article

In addition to the location requirements, Apple News makes decisions about ad placement for your articles:

- Both the size of your article and the arrangement of the components affect ad placement.

- Two ads can’t appear in the same viewport, which is the section of the article that’s currently visible within a person’s device frame.

### Adjust Your Ads Settings

To control the placement of ads in your channel, use News Publisher. For more information, see Apple News and ads in the Ads on Apple News User Guide.
