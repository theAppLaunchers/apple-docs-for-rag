# Structuring Content for Swift Playgrounds

Add content to a playground book by creating new folders and property lists.

## Overview

Combine playground books, chapters, pages, Swift modules, and cutscenes to provide a logical narrative or instructional structure to your content. For example, you can:

- Use books to package root-level Swift Playgrounds content.

- Use chapters to group pages and cutscenes within a book.

- Use pages to write the primary teaching or exploratory content of the book.

- Use modules to implement live views and provide the APIs learners write code against.

- Provide user-editable modules to give learners a space to store and reuse code.

- Intersperse cutscenes with pages to introduce or summarize concepts.

Each part of a playground book must include a manifest property list that contains metadata and references to shared resources.

Important

Modules are available starting with Swift Playgrounds 3, and version 6 of the Swift Playgrounds book format. For previous versions, place code in the Sources folder of a book, chapter, or page.

### Determine Book-Level Information

You write key details about a playground book in its `Manifest.plist` file. The Swift Playgrounds Author Template comes with a default manifest that you update with specific details about your book, like its title and the file path for the cover image.

You use the book-level manifest to configure the following properties:

`Chapters`  
**Required.** An array of strings you use to order the chapters in a book. Each string is the name of a `.playgroundchapter` directory that contains the content and resources for a chapter.

`ContentIdentifier`  
**Required.** A string that uniquely identifies your book among all others. The identifier must be in reverse-DNS format, and you should use a domain that you or your organization controls. For example, if you own `example.com`, you might set a book’s `ContentIdentifier` property to `com.example.mybook`.

`ContentVersion`  
**Required.** A string containing the version number of a book. The string can only contain sequences of numbers and periods, such as `2.0.1`. Increment the version of the book when you publish updates to it.

`DeploymentTarget`  
**Required.** A string that contains the minimum version of iOS (10.0 or later) required to run your book. You prefix the version number with the string `ios`. For example, the version string for iOS 11.3 is `ios11.3`.

`DevelopmentRegion`  
**Required.** The default language and region for the book, as a Language ID. For more information, see Language IDs and CFBundleDevelopmentRegion.

`ImageReference`  
A string containing a reference to a `.png` image file that’s stored in the book’s Resources folder and used as the book icon. The icon must be an image with a 4:3 aspect ratio. The recommended image size is 400 × 300 pixels.

`Name`  
**Required.** A string you use to provide a title for a book. This title becomes the learner-facing name displayed in Swift Playgrounds.

`Version`  
**Required.** A string containing the version of the Swift Playgrounds book format used to write the book. Use `6.0`.

`SwiftVersion`  
A string containing the version of Swift that the playground book uses. The default is `5.0`.

`MinimumSwiftPlaygroundsVersion`  
A string containing the minimum version of the Swift Playgrounds app that your book requires. The default is `1.2`.

`UserModuleMode`  
**Required.** A string you use to determine the degree to which a learner has control over user-editable modules in the book. The module mode must be one of the following types:

`"Full"`—User-editable modules that the user can add and remove as needed.

`"Limited"`—A nonremovable user module that you supply with your book.

`"Disabled"`—No user-editable modules are available.

This property is available starting with Swift Playgrounds 3.

## Topics

### Book Structure

Adding a Chapter to a Playground Book

Create a folder with a manifest that describes the chapter’s name and page order.

Adding a Page to a Playground Book

Create a subfolder, a manifest file, and a content file.

Adding a Cutscene to a Playground Book

Create a subfolder, a manifest file, and cutscene metadata.

Using Modules to Share Code in a Playground Book

In Swift Playgrounds 3.0 and later, make code available across multiple chapters to teach the value of reusable code.

Sharing Resources in a Playground Book

Reuse common assets throughout a book to reduce its size.
