## Discussion

If the user applies pressure to the button, the isPressed property is true and this property indicates the amount of pressure. The framework normalizes the value to a number between `0.0` (minimum) and `1.0` (maximum). If the user isnâ€™t pressing the button, the isPressed property is false and this property is `0.0`.

For axis buttons, such as thumbsticks and touchpads, the location on the positive or negative axis of the element simulates the pressure.
