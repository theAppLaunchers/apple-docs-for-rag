## Discussion

The values of the coordinates range between `-1` and `1` where `(0,0)` is the fixed origin. Game Controller deadzones and saturates the values so thereâ€™s no value outside this range. A zero coordinate is inside the deadzone and any coordinate greater than or less than zero is outside the deadzone.
