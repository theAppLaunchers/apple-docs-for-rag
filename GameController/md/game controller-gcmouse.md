## Overview

To get a mouse object and its input values, register for the GCMouseDidConnect (Swift) or GCMouseDidConnectNotification (Objective-C) notification for when a mouse connects to the device. Then register for the GCMouseDidBecomeCurrent (Swift) or GCMouseDidBecomeCurrentNotification (Objective-C) notification for when it becomes the current mouse. Alternatively, use the current class property or the mice() class method to get a mouse object. Then get the current input values from the mouse objectâ€™s mouseInput controller profile.
