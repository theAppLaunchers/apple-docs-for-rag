Instance Method

# setModeVibrationWithStartPosition(\_:amplitude:frequency:)

Sets the mode to vibrate when the user depresses the trigger at the start position or at a greater value.

``` source
func setModeVibrationWithStartPosition(
    _ startPosition: Float,
    amplitude: Float,
    frequency: Float
)
```

## Parameters 

`startPosition`  

The effectâ€™s start position. A value between `0` and `1` , where `0` is the minimum and `1` is the maximum trigger depression.

`amplitude`  

The amplitude of the vibration effect. A value between `0` and `1`, where `0` is the minimum and `1` is the maximum amplitude.

`frequency`  

The frequency of the vibration effect, which is a value between `0` and `1`, where `0` is the minimum and `1` is the maximum frequency.
