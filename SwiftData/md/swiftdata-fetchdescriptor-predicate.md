# predicate

The logical condition that determines whether the fetch includes a specific model in its results.

``` source
var predicate: Predicate?
```

## Discussion

Use this property to replace or remove the fetch descriptorâ€™s predicate. If the value is `nil`, any fetch using the descriptor will return all models of the associated type.

The default value is the predicate you specify when calling init(predicate:sortBy:).
