``` source
func lastIndex(of element: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `Equatable`.

## Parameters 

`element`  

An element to search for in the collection.

## Return Value

The last index where `element` is found. If `element` is not found in the collection, this method returns `nil`.

## Discussion

After using `lastIndex(of:)` to find the position of the last instance of a particular element in a collection, you can use it to access the element by subscripting. This example shows how you can modify one of the names in an array of students.

```
var students = ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Ben", "Maxime"]
if let i = students.lastIndex(of: "Ben") {
    students[i] = "Benjamin"
}
print(students)
// Prints "["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Benjamin", "Max"]"
```

Complexity

O(*n*), where *n* is the length of the collection.
