Weather data error `WeatherError`

The statistics returned for each month are derived from weather data recorded over the past decades, to the present date. Each item returned represents statistics for a particular Gregorian Calendar month of the year.

This is a variadic API in which any combination of data sets can be requested and returned as a tuple. Hereâ€™s an example:

```
let (monthlyPrecipitationStatistics, monthlyTemperatureStatistics) = try await service.monthlyStatistics(for: newYork, including: .precipitation, .temperature)
```
