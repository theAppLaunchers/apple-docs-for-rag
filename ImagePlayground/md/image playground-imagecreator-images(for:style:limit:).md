final func images(
    for concepts: [ImagePlaygroundConcept],
    style: ImagePlaygroundStyle,
    limit: Int
) -> some AsyncSequence
```

## Parameters 

`concepts`  

The elements that describe the expected contents of the image.

`style`  

The style you want the model to apply to the output image. It is a programmer error to specify a style thatâ€™s not in the `availableStyles` property.

`limit`  

The maximum number of images you want the system to create. The system limits the maximum number of images to 4.

## Return Value

An asynchronous stream you use to receive the images.

## Discussion

Call this method to start the image generation process with the specified parameters. The method executes asynchronously and returns the images on the provided AsyncSequence object. The following example configures an image creator, starts the creation of the images, and processes the generated images as they arrive.
