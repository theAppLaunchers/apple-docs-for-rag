## Overview

Present an ImagePlaygroundViewController to display a standard system interface to generate images from a description you provide. People use the view controller interface to generate images and experiment with the contents before returning an image to your app. You can then incorporate that image into your appâ€™s content.

Create an ImagePlaygroundViewController and configure it with an initial description of the image you want before you present it. Specify a text-based description of the image using the concepts property. If you have a starting image that you want to use to create the new image, specify your image in the sourceImage property.

Present this view controller from your interface and wait for it to deliver results to your custom delegate object. If the person approves the image, the view controller sends that image to your app via this delegate object. The view controller also notifies your delegate if the person cancels the operation.

## Topics

### Creating the view controller

init()

Creates a new image-generation view controller for you to present.

### Processing a generated image

var delegate: (any ImagePlaygroundViewController.Delegate)?

The delegate object that receives the generated image and handles events from the view controller.

protocol Delegate

### Specifying the source content

var concepts: [ImagePlaygroundConcept]
