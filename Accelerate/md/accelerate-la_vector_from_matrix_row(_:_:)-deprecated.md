## Return Value

The resulting vector is a 1 x cols(matrix) vector.

### Parameters

matrix  
Matrix from which to create the row vector.

matrix_row  
The zero-based index of the row to create the vector from.

Creates a vector from the specified row of the matrix. If the value for matrix_row is less than zero or greater than rows(matrix)-1, LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR is returned.

If matrix is a splat, LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR is returned.

Always returns a 1 x vector_length vector.
