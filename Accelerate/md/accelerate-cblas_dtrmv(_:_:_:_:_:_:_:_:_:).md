``` source
func cblas_dtrmv(
    _ ORDER: CBLAS_ORDER,
    _ UPLO: CBLAS_UPLO,
    _ TRANSA: CBLAS_TRANSPOSE,
    _ DIAG: CBLAS_DIAG,
    _ N: __LAPACK_int,
    _ A: UnsafePointer?,
    _ LDA: __LAPACK_int,
    _ X: UnsafeMutablePointer?,
    _ INCX: __LAPACK_int
)
```

## Parameters 

`ORDER`  

Specifies row-major (C) or column-major (Fortran) data ordering.

`UPLO`  

Specifies whether to use the upper or lower triangle from the matrix. Valid values are `'U'` or `'L'`.

`TRANSA`  

Specifies whether to use matrix A (`'N'` or `'n'`) or the transpose of A (`'T'`, `'t'`, `'C'`, or `'c'`).

`DIAG`  

Specifies whether the matrix is unit triangular. Possible values are `'U'` (unit triangular) or `'N'` (not unit triangular).

`N`  

Order of matrix `A`.

`A`  

Triangular matrix `A`.

`LDA`  

Leading dimension of matrix `A`.

`X`  

Vector `X`.

`INCX`  

Stride within `X`. For example, if `incX` is 7, every 7th element is used.

## Discussion

Multiplies `A*X` or `A'*X`, depending on the value of `TransA`.

Important

Apple provides the BLAS and LAPACK libraries under the Accelerate framework to be in line with LAPACK 3.9.1. Starting with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, tvOS 18, watchOS 18, and visionOS 2, the libraries are in line with LAPACK 3.11.0. These new interfaces provide additional functionality, as well as a new ILP64 interface. To use the new interfaces, define `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK` before including the Accelerate or vecLib headers. For ILP64 interfaces, also define `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64`. For Swift projects, specify `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK=1` and `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64=1` as preprocessor macros in Xcode build settings.
