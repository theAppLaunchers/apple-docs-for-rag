Function

# vImageOverwriteChannelsWithScalar_Planar16F(\_:\_:\_:)

Overwrites a floating-point 16-bit planar buffer with the specified scalar value in place.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 9.0+

``` source
func vImageOverwriteChannelsWithScalar_Planar16F(
    _ scalar: Pixel_16F,
    _ dest: UnsafePointer,
    _ flags: vImage_Flags
) -> vImage_Error
```

## Parameters 

`scalar`  

The scalar value that provides the new pixel values.

`dest`  

A pointer to the destination vImage buffer structure. Youâ€™re responsible for filling out the height, width, and rowBytes fields of this structure, and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer this structure points to contains the destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks.

`flags`  

The options to use when performing the operation. If your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass kvImageDoNotTile; otherwise, pass kvImageNoFlags.

## Return Value

kvImageNoError; otherwise, one of the error codes in Data Types and Constants.

## Discussion

The following code fills `pixelBuffer` with `scalar`:

```
let pixelBuffer = vImage.PixelBuffer(
    size: .init(width: 4, height: 1))

let scalar: Pixel_16F = 101

pixelBuffer.withUnsafePointerToVImageBuffer { buf in
    _ = vImageOverwriteChannelsWithScalar_Planar16F(scalar,
                                                    buf,
                                                    vImage_Flags(kvImageNoFlags))
}

// Prints "[101, 101, 101, 101]".
print(pixelBuffer.array)
```
