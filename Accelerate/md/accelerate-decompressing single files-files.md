# Decompressing single files

Recreate a single file from a compressed file.

## Overview

In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to use AppleArchive to decompress a previously compressed file, and write the decompressed data to a file.

The code below decompresses the file generated using the steps explained in Compressing single files.

### Create the file stream to read the source archive

The ArchiveByteStream class provides static factory methods that create streams for different functions. In this case, use fileStream(path:mode:options:permissions:) to create a byte stream that reads the source file:

```
let archiveFilePath = FilePath(NSTemporaryDirectory() + "myFile.pdf.lzfse")

guard let readFileStream = ArchiveByteStream.fileStream(
        path: archiveFilePath,
        mode: .readOnly,
        options: [ ],
        permissions: FilePermissions(rawValue: 0o644)) else {
    return
}
defer {
    try? readFileStream.close()
}
```

### Create the file stream to write the decompressed file

You also use fileStream(path:mode:options:permissions:) to create the file stream that writes the decompressed file to the file system. In this case, use the writeOnly mode:

```
let destinationFilePath = FilePath(NSTemporaryDirectory() + "myFile_decompressed.pdf")

guard let writeFileStream = ArchiveByteStream.fileStream(
        path: destinationFilePath,
        mode: .writeOnly,
        options: [ .create ],
        permissions: FilePermissions(rawValue: 0o644)) else {
    return
}
defer {
    try? writeFileStream.close()
}
```

### Create the decompression stream

Create the decompression stream. Specify the file-reading stream as the input stream that provides the compressed data:

```
guard let decompressStream = ArchiveByteStream.decompressionStream(readingFrom: readFileStream) else {
    print("unable to create compress stream")
    return
}
defer {
    try? decompressStream.close()
}
```

### Decompress the source archive

Finally, call process(readingFrom:writingTo:) to write the output of the decompression stream to the file-writing stream:

```
do {
    _ = try ArchiveByteStream.process(readingFrom: decompressStream,
                                      writingTo: writeFileStream)
} catch {
    print("Handle `ArchiveByteStream.process` failed.")
}
```

On return, `myFile_decompressed.pdf` exists in NSTemporaryDirectory() and contains the decompressed contents of `myFile.pdf.lzfse`.
