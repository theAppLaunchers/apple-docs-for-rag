Function

# vSrot(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Applies planar rotation to a set of n points whose x and y coordinates are contained in two arrays of vectors.

macOS 10.0â€“10.14Deprecated

``` source
func vSrot(
    _ n: Int32,
    _ x: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ y: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ c: Float,
    _ s: Float
)
```

Deprecated

Use cblas_srot instead

## Parameters 

`n`  

Number of points to be rotated; must be a multiple of 4.

`x`  

Vector with `n`/4 elements of type `vector float`, representing the x-coordinates of the points.

`y`  

Vector with `n`/4 elements of type `vector float`, representing the y-coordinates of the points.

`c`  

Cosine of the angle of rotation.

`s`  

Sine of the angle of rotation.

## Discussion

The coordinates are modified in place in the vectors in arrays `x` and `y`.
