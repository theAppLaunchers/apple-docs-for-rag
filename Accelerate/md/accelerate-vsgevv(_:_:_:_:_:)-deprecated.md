Function

# vSgevv(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Produces the outer product of two vectors and places the results into a matrix.

macOS 10.0â€“10.14Deprecated

``` source
func vSgevv(
    _ l: Int32,
    _ n: Int32,
    _ A: UnsafePointer,
    _ B: UnsafePointer,
    _ M: UnsafeMutablePointer
)
```

Deprecated

Use cblas_sger on a zero matrix instead

## Parameters 

`l`  

Number of elements in vector `A` and the number of rows in matrix `M`; must be a multiple of 4.

`n`  

Number of elements in vector `B` and the number of columns in matrix `M`; must be a multiple of 4.

`A`  

Vector with `l` elements.

`B`  

Vector with `n` elements.

`M`  

Matrix with `l` rows and `n` columns.

## Discussion

The vectors `A` and `B` are multiplied and the result is stored in matrix `M`, that is, for `0
