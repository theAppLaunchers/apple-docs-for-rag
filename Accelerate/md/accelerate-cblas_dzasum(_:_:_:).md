Function

# cblas_dzasum(\_:\_:\_:)

Computes the sum of the absolute values of real and imaginary parts of elements in a vector (single-precision complex).

iOS 16.4+iPadOS 16.4+Mac Catalyst 16.4+macOS 13.3+tvOS 16.4+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 9.4+

``` source
func cblas_dzasum(
    _ N: __LAPACK_int,
    _ X: OpaquePointer?,
    _ INCX: __LAPACK_int
) -> Double
```

## Parameters 

`N`  

Number of elements in the vector.

`X`  

Source vector

`INCX`  

Stride within `X`. For example, if `incX` is 7, every 7th element is used.

## Return Value

The return value is a single floating point value that contains the sum of the absolute values of both the real and imaginary parts of the vector.

## Discussion

Important

Apple provides the BLAS and LAPACK libraries under the Accelerate framework to be in line with LAPACK 3.9.1. Starting with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, tvOS 18, watchOS 18, and visionOS 2, the libraries are in line with LAPACK 3.11.0. These new interfaces provide additional functionality, as well as a new ILP64 interface. To use the new interfaces, define `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK` before including the Accelerate or vecLib headers. For ILP64 interfaces, also define `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64`. For Swift projects, specify `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK=1` and `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64=1` as preprocessor macros in Xcode build settings.
