Copies the contents of a vImage buffer to a destination buffer.

iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.10+tvOS 8.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 1.0+

``` source
func vImageCopyBuffer(
    _ src: UnsafePointer,
    _ dest: UnsafePointer,
    _ pixelSize: Int,
    _ flags: vImage_Flags
) -> vImage_Error
```

## Parameters 

`src`  

The source vImage buffer.

`dest`  

A pointer to the destination vImage buffer structure. You’re responsible for filling out the `height`, `width`, and `rowBytes` fields of this structure, and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer this structure points to contains the destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks.

`pixelSize`  

The number of bytes for one pixel.

`flags`  

The options to use when performing the operation. If your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass kvImageDoNotTile; otherwise, pass kvImageNoFlags.

## Return Value

kvImageNoError; otherwise, one of the error codes in Data Types and Constants.
