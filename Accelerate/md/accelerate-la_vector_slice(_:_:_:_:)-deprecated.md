## Parameters 

`vector`  

The vector to be sliced.

`vector_first`  

The index of the source vector element that will become the first element of the new slice vector.

`vector_stride`  

The offset in the source vector between elements that will be consecutive in the new slice vector.

`slice_length`  

The length of the resulting slice vector.

## Return Value

A new vector with length slice_length whose elements are taken from vector.

## Discussion

Create a slice of a vector.

The result object is the vector:

\[ vector\[vector_first\], vector\[vector_first+vector_stride\], … … , vector\[vector_first + (slice_length-1)\*vector_stride\] \]

Slices provide an efficient means to operate on subvectors and strides. These are lightweight objects that reference the storage of the vector from which they originate. Creating a vector slice does not require any allocation beyond the object representing the slice, nor does it require copying.

This function supports slicing a vector, or a matrix that has only one row or only one column. If the object is not a matrix or vector, or if it is a matrix with both dimensions larger than one, the returned object will have status LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.

If the slice references indices that are less than zero or greater than or equal to the length of the vector, LA_SLICE_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_ERROR is returned.

Always return a vector with the same orientation as the input. If input is vector_length x 1, output is vector_length x 1 and if input is 1 x vector_length, output is 1 x vector_length.
