``` source
struct bnns_graph_context_t
```

## Overview

The bnns_graph_context_t object wraps a bnns_graph_t instance and adds mutable data storage. BNNS requires mutability to support dynamic shapes and other execution objects.

You must ensure that the underlying bnns_graph_t instance remains valid throughout the lifetime of the context.

## Topics

### Initializing a context

init()

Creates an empty graph context structure.

init(data: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, size: Int)

Creates a graph context structure from the specified opaque graph context object.

### Specifying a contextâ€™s properties

var data: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?

A pointer to the opaque graph context object.

var size: Int

The size, in bytes, of the opaque graph context object.
