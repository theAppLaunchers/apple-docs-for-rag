# Transforming with polynomials

Use polynomials to apply color transformations to images.

## Overview

Polynomial functions apply one or more polynomials to the input image to generate the output image. You can use polynomial functions to apply tone curve adjustments to images.

## Topics

### Applying a polynomial

Applying tone curve adjustments to images

Use the vImage libraryâ€™s polynomial transform to apply tone curve adjustments to images.

func vImagePiecewisePolynomial_Planar8toPlanarF(UnsafePointer&lt;vImage_Buffer>, UnsafePointer&lt;vImage_Buffer>, UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;UnsafePointer&lt;Float>?>, UnsafePointer&lt;Float>, UInt32, UInt32, vImage_Flags) -> vImage_Error

Applies a set of piecewise polynomials to transform an 8-bit planar image to a 32-bit planar image.
