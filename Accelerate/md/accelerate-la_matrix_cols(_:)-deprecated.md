## Discussion

Get the number of columns in a matrix.

If the argument has an error status, zero is returned. If the argument is a vector, the number of columns may be 1 or length(vector) depending on the orientation of the vector. If the argument is a matrix, the number of columns is returned. Otherwise, zero is returned.
