## Discussion

“Normalizes” a vector or matrix.

The returned object has the same direction as the first operand, and has norm 1 in the specified vector norm. If the input vector is zero, it cannot be meaningfully normalized and the returned object is also zero. If the parameter vector is not a vector or matrix, or if the vector_norm parameter is not a supported value, the returned object has status LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.
