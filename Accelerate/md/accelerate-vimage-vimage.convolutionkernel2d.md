## Topics

### Initializers

init(values: [ComponentType], size: vImage.Size)

Returns a new convolution kernel structure with the size you specify.

init(values: [ComponentType], width: Int, height: Int)

Returns a new convolution kernel structure with the width and height you specify.

### Instance Properties

let width: vImagePixelCount

The width of the kernel that must be a positive, odd number.

let height: vImagePixelCount

The height of the kernel that must be a positive, odd number.

let values: [ComponentType]

The kernel weights or structuring element values that must contain `height * width` elements.
