## Discussion

Compute the inner product of two vectors.

If either operand is a matrix that is not 1xn or nx1, the result has the status LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.

If either operand is not a vector or matrix or splat, or if both operands are splats, the result has the status LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.

If the lengths of the two operands do not match, the result has the status LA_DIMENSION_MISMATCH_ERROR.

Otherwise the result is a 1x1 matrix containing the inner product:

```
    sum_{i=0...length} vector_left[i] * vector_right[i]
```
