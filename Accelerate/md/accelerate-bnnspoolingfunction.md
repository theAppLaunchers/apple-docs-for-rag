## Topics

### Pooling Functions

static var max: BNNSPoolingFunction

A function for pooling that computes the maximum of each element in the pooling kernel.

Deprecated

static var average: BNNSPoolingFunction

A function for pooling that computes the average of each element in the pooling kernel.

Deprecated

### Raw Values

init(UInt32)

init(rawValue: UInt32)

var rawValue: UInt32

var BNNSPoolingFunctionUnMax: BNNSPoolingFunction

A function for pooling thatâ€™s the partial inverse of max pooling and sets all nonmaximal values to zero.

var BNNSPoolingFunctionAverageCountIncludePadding: BNNSPoolingFunction

A function for pooling that computes the average of each element in the pooling kernel, including zero-padding.

var BNNSPoolingFunctionAverageCountExcludePadding: BNNSPoolingFunction

A function for pooling that computes the average of each element in the pooling kernel, excluding zero-padding.

var BNNSPoolingFunctionL2Norm: BNNSPoolingFunction

A function for pooling that computes the square root of the sum of squares of each element in the pooling kernel.
