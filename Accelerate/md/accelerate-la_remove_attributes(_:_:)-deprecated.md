    _ attributes: la_attribute_t
)
```

Deprecated

This API is deprecated, please use BLAS and LAPACK

## Parameters 

`object`  

The object that will have its attributes modified.

`attributes`  

Attributes which are to be removed from the object’s existing attributes to create its new set of attributes. This value should be constructed by or’ing together LA_ATTRIBUTE\_\* constants.

## Discussion

Remove attributes from an la_object_t object.

This function removes the specified attributes from the LinearAlgebra object. Removing an attribute that the object does not have is harmless and does not change the object.

This function is not reentrant or thread-safe. Attempting to add or remove attributes from multiple threads will have unpredictable results.
