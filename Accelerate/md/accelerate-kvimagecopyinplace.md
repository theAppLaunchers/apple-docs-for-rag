## Discussion

When you set this flag, and a convolution function is processing an image pixel for which some of the kernel extends beyond the image boundaries, vImage does not compute the convolution. Instead, the value of the particular pixel unchanged; itâ€™s simply copied to the destination image. This flag is valid only for convolution operations. The morphology functions do not use this flag because they do not use pixels outside the image in any of their calculations.
