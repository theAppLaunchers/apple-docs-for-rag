Function

# vSndot(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Computes the dot products of n pairs of vectors, accumulating or storing the results in an array of `n` `float` values.

macOS 10.0â€“10.14Deprecated

``` source
func vSndot(
    _ n: Int32,
    _ m: Int32,
    _ s: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ isw: Int32,
    _ x: UnsafePointer,
    _ y: UnsafePointer
)
```

Deprecated

Use cblas_sdot or vDSP_dotpr in a loop instead

## Parameters 

`n`  

Number of dot products to compute, and number of elements in vector `s` ; must be a multiple of 4.

`m`  

Number of elements in the vectors whose dot products are computed; must be a multiple of 4.

`s`  

Destination vector; the `n` dot products are accumulated or stored here.

`isw`  

A key that selects one of the four variants of this function: see Discussion below.

`x`  

A matrix whose rows are `n` floating-point vectors, each containing `m` values.

`y`  

A second matrix whose rows are `n` floating-point vectors, each containing `m` values.

## Discussion

For i = 0 to n-1, the dot product of vectors `x`\[i\] and `y`\[i\] is computed. The dot product is accumulated or stored in `s`\[i\], according to the value of `isw`:

- if `isw` = 1, the dot product is stored in `s`\[i\].

- if `isw` = 2, the dot product is negated and then stored in `s`\[i\].

- if `isw` = 3, the dot product is added to the value in `s`\[i\].

- if `isw` = 4, the dot product is negated and then added to the value in `s`\[i\].
