Function

# vSnrm2(\_:\_:)

Finds the Euclidean length of a vector.

macOS 10.0â€“10.14Deprecated

``` source
func vSnrm2(
    _ count: Int32,
    _ x: UnsafePointer
) -> Float
```

Deprecated

Use cblas_snrm2 instead

## Parameters 

`count`  

Number of elements in the vector `x`; must be a multiple of 4.

`x`  

A vector array of `float` values.

## Return Value

The Euclidean length of `x`.

## Discussion

Input is scaled to avoid destructive underflow and overflow.
