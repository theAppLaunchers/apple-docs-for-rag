Function

# vSscal(\_:\_:\_:)

Scales a vector in place.

macOS 10.0â€“10.14Deprecated

``` source
func vSscal(
    _ n: Int32,
    _ alpha: Float,
    _ x: UnsafeMutablePointer
)
```

Deprecated

Use cblas_sscal instead

## Parameters 

`n`  

Number of elements in vector `x`; must be a multiple of 4.

`alpha`  

Scaling factor.

`x`  

Vector with `n` elements of type `float`.

## Discussion

Each element of vector `x` is multiplied in place by `alpha`.
