Function

# vSyax(\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Multiplies each element of a vector and stores the results in a second vector.

macOS 10.0â€“10.14Deprecated

``` source
func vSyax(
    _ n: Int32,
    _ alpha: Float,
    _ x: UnsafePointer,
    _ y: UnsafeMutablePointer
)
```

Deprecated

Use vDSP_vsmul instead

## Parameters 

`n`  

Number of elements in vectors `x` and `y`; must be a multiple of 4.

`alpha`  

Multiplier.

`x`  

Source vector with `n` elements of type `float`.

`y`  

Destination vector with `n` elements of type `float`.

## Discussion

Each element of vector `x` is multiplied by `alpha`, and stored in the corresponding element of `y`.
