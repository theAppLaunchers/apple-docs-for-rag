## Discussion

Compute the outer product of two vectors.

Splats are not supported by this function. If either operand is a splat, the result has status LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.

If either operand is a matrix that is not 1xn or nx1, the result has the status LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.

If either operand is not a vector or matrix, the result has the status LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.

Otherwise the result is a matrix containg the outer product. It has length(vector_left) rows and length(vector_right) columns. The i,jth element of the matrix is vector_left\[i\] \* vector_right\[j\].
