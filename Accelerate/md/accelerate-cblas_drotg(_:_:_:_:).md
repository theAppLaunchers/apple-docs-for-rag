Function

# cblas_drotg(\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Constructs a Givens rotation matrix.

iOS 16.4+iPadOS 16.4+Mac Catalyst 16.4+macOS 13.3+tvOS 16.4+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 9.4+

``` source
func cblas_drotg(
    _ A: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ B: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ C: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ S: UnsafeMutablePointer
)
```

## Parameters 

`A`  

Double-precision value `a`. Overwritten on return with result `r`.

`B`  

Double-precision value `b`. Overwritten on return with result `z` (zero).

`C`  

Unused on entry. Overwritten on return with the value `cos(θ)`.

`S`  

Unused on entry. Overwritten on return with the value `sin(θ)`.

## Discussion

Given a vertical matrix containing `a` and `b`, computes the values of `cos θ` and `sin θ` that zero the lower value (`b`). Returns the value of `sin θ` in `s`, the value of `cos θ` in `c`, and the upper value (`r`) in `a`.

Important

Apple provides the BLAS and LAPACK libraries under the Accelerate framework to be in line with LAPACK 3.9.1. Starting with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, tvOS 18, watchOS 18, and visionOS 2, the libraries are in line with LAPACK 3.11.0. These new interfaces provide additional functionality, as well as a new ILP64 interface. To use the new interfaces, define `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK` before including the Accelerate or vecLib headers. For ILP64 interfaces, also define `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64`. For Swift projects, specify `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK=1` and `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64=1` as preprocessor macros in Xcode build settings.
