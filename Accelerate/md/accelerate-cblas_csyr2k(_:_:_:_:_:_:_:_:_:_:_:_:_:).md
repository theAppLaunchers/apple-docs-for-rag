## Parameters 

`ORDER`  

Specifies row-major (C) or column-major (Fortran) data ordering.

`UPLO`  

Specifies whether to use the upper or lower triangle from the matrix. Valid values are `'U'` or `'L'`.

`TRANS`  

Specifies whether to use matrix A (`'N'` or `'n'`), the transpose of A (`'T'` or `'t'`), or the conjugate of A (`'C'` or `'c'`).

Order of matrix `C`.

`K`  

Specifies the number of columns in matrices `A` and `B` if `trans='N'`. Specifies the number of rows if `trans='C'` or `trans='T'`).

`ALPHA`  

Scaling factor for matrix `A`.

`A`  

Matrix `A`.

`LDA`  

Leading dimension of array containing matrix `A`.

`B`  

Matrix `B`.

`LDB`  

Leading dimension of array containing matrix `B`.

`BETA`  

Scaling factor for matrix `C`.

`C`  

Matrix `C`.

`LDC`  

Leading dimension of array containing matrix `C`.

Important

Apple provides the BLAS and LAPACK libraries under the Accelerate framework to be in line with LAPACK 3.9.1. Starting with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, tvOS 18, watchOS 18, and visionOS 2, the libraries are in line with LAPACK 3.11.0. These new interfaces provide additional functionality, as well as a new ILP64 interface. To use the new interfaces, define `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK` before including the Accelerate or vecLib headers. For ILP64 interfaces, also define `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64`. For Swift projects, specify `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK=1` and `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64=1` as preprocessor macros in Xcode build settings.
