``` source
func la_release(_ object: la_object_t)
```

Deprecated

This API is deprecated, please use BLAS and LAPACK

## Parameters 

`object`  

The object to release.

## Discussion

Decrement the reference count of an la_object_t object.

On a platform with the modern Objective-C runtime this is exactly equivalent to sending the object the -\[release\] message.
