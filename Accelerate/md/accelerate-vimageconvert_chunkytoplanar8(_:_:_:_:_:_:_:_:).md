Function

# vImageConvert_ChunkyToPlanar8(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Deinterleaves an 8-bit-per-channel interleaved buffer with an arbitrary number of channels into the corresponding number of 8-bit planar buffers.

``` source
func vImageConvert_ChunkyToPlanar8(
    _ srcChannels: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ destPlanarBuffers: UnsafeMutablePointer?>,
    _ channelCount: UInt32,
    _ srcStrideBytes: Int,
    _ srcWidth: vImagePixelCount,
    _ srcHeight: vImagePixelCount,
    _ srcRowBytes: Int,
    _ flags: vImage_Flags
) -> vImage_Error
```

## Parameters 

`srcChannels`  

An array that contains pointers to the start of each channel in the source buffer.

`destPlanarBuffers`  

An array that contains `channelCount` destination planar vImage buffers. Each source buffer must be the same height and width, but they may have different rowBytes values.

`channelCount`  

The number of channels in the source image.

`srcStrideBytes`  

The number of bytes between consecutive pixels in a channel in the same row.

`srcWidth`  

The width, in pixels, of the source channels and the destination planar buffers.

`srcHeight`  

The height, in pixels, of the source channels and the destination planar buffers.

`srcRowBytes`  

The distance, in bytes, between the corresponding pixels in consecutive rows in the source buffer, including any unused space between them.

`flags`  

The options to use when performing the operation. If your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass kvImageDoNotTile; otherwise, pass kvImageNoFlags.

## Return Value

kvImageNoError; otherwise, one of the error codes in Data Types and Constants.

## Discussion

Use this function to deinterleave formats that either aren’t supported by the vImage library or are only known at runtime.

The following code interleaves a 4 x 1 interleaved 2-channel buffer into two 4 x 1 planar buffers:

```
let width = 4
let height = 1
let size = vImage.Size(width: width,
                       height: height)

let cbCrBuffer = vImage.PixelBuffer(pixelValues: [10, 20,   11, 21,   12, 22,   13, 23],
                                    size: size,
                                    pixelFormat: vImage.Interleaved8x2.self)

let cbBuffer = vImage.PixelBuffer(size: size,
                                  pixelFormat: vImage.Planar8.self)

let crBuffer = vImage.PixelBuffer(size: size,
                                  pixelFormat: vImage.Planar8.self)

cbCrBuffer.withUnsafeVImageBuffer { cbcr in
    cbBuffer.withUnsafePointerToVImageBuffer { cb in
        crBuffer.withUnsafePointerToVImageBuffer { cr in

            var srcChannels = [
                UnsafeRawPointer(cbcr.data),
                UnsafeRawPointer(cbcr.data.advanced(by: MemoryLayout.stride))
            ]

            var dstPlanarBuffers = [Optional(cb), Optional(cr)]

            let channelCount = 2

            _ = vImageConvert_ChunkyToPlanar8(
                &srcChannels,
                &dstPlanarBuffers,
                UInt32(channelCount),
                MemoryLayout.stride * channelCount,
                vImagePixelCount(width),
                vImagePixelCount(height),
                cbcr.rowBytes,
                vImage_Flags(kvImageNoFlags))

        }
    }
}

// Prints "[10, 11,    12, 13]".
print(cbBuffer.array)

// Prints "[20, 21,    22, 23]".
print(crBuffer.array)
```
