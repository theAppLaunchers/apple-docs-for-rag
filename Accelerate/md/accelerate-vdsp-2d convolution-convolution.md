# 2D convolution

Perform convolution operations on matrices of real data.

## Overview

Use the functions in this group to apply a convolution kernel to a 2D matrix. The vDSP library provides functions to convolve with fixed-sized kernels and kernels with an arbitrary size.

Important

The functions in this group donâ€™t support in-place operation.

## Topics
