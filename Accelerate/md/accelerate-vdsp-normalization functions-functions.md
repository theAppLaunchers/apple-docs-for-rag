# Normalization functions

Compute the mean and standard deviation of a vector and calculate new elements to have a zero mean and a unit standard deviation.

## Topics

### Normalization Functions

Finding the sharpest image in a sequence of captured images

Share image data between vDSP and vImage to compute the sharpest image from a bracketed photo sequence.

vDSP_normalize

Computes single-precision mean and standard deviation, and then calculates new elements to have a zero mean and a unit standard deviation.

vDSP_normalizeD

Computes double-precision mean and standard deviation, and then calculates new elements to have a zero mean and a unit standard deviation.
