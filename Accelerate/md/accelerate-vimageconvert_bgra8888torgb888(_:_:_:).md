# vImageConvert_BGRA8888toRGB888(\_:\_:\_:)

Removes the alpha channel from an 8-bit-per-channel BGRA buffer to produce an 8-bit-per-channel RGB result.

``` source
func vImageConvert_BGRA8888toRGB888(
    _: UnsafePointer,
    _: UnsafePointer,
    _: vImage_Flags
) -> vImage_Error
```

## Return Value

kvImageNoError; otherwise, one of the error codes in Data Types and Constants.

## Discussion

This function copies the red, green, and blue source channels to the destination buffer.

### Parameters

bgraSrc  
The source vImage buffer.

rgbDest  
A pointer to the destination vImage buffer structure. Youâ€™re responsible for filling out the height, width, and rowBytes fields of this structure, and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer this structure points to contains the destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks.

flags  
The options to use when performing the operation. If your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass kvImageDoNotTile; otherwise, pass kvImageNoFlags.
