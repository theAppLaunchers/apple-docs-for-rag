## Discussion

Multiply a matrix or vector by a scalar given by a double.

Returns a matrix whose entries are the product of the scalar and the corresponding element of the source matrix. If the source object is not a vector or matrix, the returned object will have status LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.

If the scalar type of matrix is not double LA_PRECISION_MISMATCH_ERROR is returned.
