# vSgetmo(\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Transposes a matrix out of place.

macOS 10.0â€“10.14Deprecated

    _ height: Int32,
    _ width: Int32,
    _ x: UnsafePointer,
    _ y: UnsafeMutablePointer
)
```

## Parameters 

`height`  

Number of rows in matrix `x` and number of columns in matrix y; must be a multiple of 4.

`width`  

Number of columns in matrix `x` and number of rows in matrix y; must be a multiple of 4.

`x`  

Matrix with `height` rows and `width` columns.

`y`  

Matrix with `width` rows and `height` columns.

## Discussion

The matrix `x` is transposed into matrix `y`.
