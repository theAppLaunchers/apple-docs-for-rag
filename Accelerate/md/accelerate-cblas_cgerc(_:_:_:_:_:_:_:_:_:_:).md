## Parameters 

`ORDER`  

Specifies row-major (C) or column-major (Fortran) data ordering.

`M`  

Number of rows in matrix `A`.

`N`  

Number of columns in matrix `A`.

`ALPHA`  

Scaling factor for vector `X`.

`X`  

Vector `X`.

`INCX`  

Stride within `X`. For example, if `incX` is 7, every 7th element is used.

`Y`  

Vector `Y`.

`INCY`  

Stride within `Y`. For example, if `incY` is 7, every 7th element is used.

`A`  

Matrix `A`.

`LDA`  

Leading dimension of array containing matrix `A`.

## Discussion

Computes `alpha*x*conjg(y') + A`.

Important

Apple provides the BLAS and LAPACK libraries under the Accelerate framework to be in line with LAPACK 3.9.1. Starting with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, tvOS 18, watchOS 18, and visionOS 2, the libraries are in line with LAPACK 3.11.0. These new interfaces provide additional functionality, as well as a new ILP64 interface. To use the new interfaces, define `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK` before including the Accelerate or vecLib headers. For ILP64 interfaces, also define `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64`. For Swift projects, specify `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK=1` and `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64=1` as preprocessor macros in Xcode build settings.
