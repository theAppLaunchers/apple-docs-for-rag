## Discussion

Mipmapping is a technique that can increase rendering performance when rendering a texture image at smaller sizes. A texture can contain several mipmap levels for its image contents, each at a fraction of the original imageâ€™s size. A renderer samples texels from the mipmap level closest to the size being rendered.

The default value is MDLMaterialMipMapFilterMode.linear, indicating that a renderer should linearly interpolate between mipmap levels.
