## Discussion

Mipmapping is a technique that uses multiple sizes of a texture image to increase rendering performance. If this propertyâ€™s value is zero, the texture contains a single image, whose size matches the dimensions property. If this value is 1, the texture contains an additional image at half the original dimensions; if this value is 2, the texture contains images at the original size, at half size, and at quarter size; and so on.
