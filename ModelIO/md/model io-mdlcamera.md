## Overview

Camera parameters include basic information—such as the projectionMatrix and fieldOfView properties—for use with any renderer, as well as attributes that model real-world cameras—such as the fStop and exposure properties—for use in a renderer based on realistic optical physics.

## Topics

### Managing Camera Position and Orientation

func frameBoundingBox(MDLAxisAlignedBoundingBox, setNearAndFar: Bool)

Moves the camera such that the specified bounding box lies entirely within the camera’s field of view.

func look(at: vector_float3)

Orients the camera to face toward the specified point.

func look(at: vector_float3, from: vector_float3)

Sets the camera’s position and orients the camera to face toward the specified point.

### Managing Camera Perspective

var projectionMatrix: matrix_float4x4

A transformation matrix that determines the extent of a scene visible to the camera.

var projection: MDLCameraProjection

The style of projection transform used by the camera.

enum MDLCameraProjection

Options for camera projection styles, used by the projection property.

var nearVisibilityDistance: Float

The camera’s near depth limit.

var farVisibilityDistance: Float

The camera’s far depth limit.

var fieldOfView: Float

The camera’s field of view, in degrees.

func ray(to: vector_int2, forViewPort: vector_int2) -> vector_float3

Returns a point, in 3D world coordinates, corresponding to the specified 2D view coordinates.

var worldToMetersConversionScale: Float

The scale factor to meters from the world coordinate system containing the camera.

### Modeling a Physical Lens

var barrelDistortion: Float

The first coefficient for determining the radial distortion applied to pixels rendered using the camera.

var fisheyeDistortion: Float

The second coefficient for determining the radial distortion applied to pixels rendered using the camera.

var opticalVignetting: Float

The amount of radial light attenuation around the edges of an image rendered using the camera.

var chromaticAberration: Float

The amount of radial color shift around the edges of an image rendered using the camera.

var focalLength: Float

The focal length, in millimeters, of the camera’s simulated lens.

var fStop: Float

The relative aperture ratio of the camera’s simulated lens.

var apertureBladeCount: Int

The number of blades in the camera’s simulated aperture.

func bokehKernel(withSize: vector_int2) -> MDLTexture

Creates and returns a texture, based on the camera’s aperture blade count, to be used in rendering out-of-focus highlights in a scene.

var maximumCircleOfConfusion: Float

The maximum diameter, in millimeters on the imaging plane, at which light from a point source should appear in an image rendered using the camera.

var focusDistance: Float

The distance, in meters, at which the lens is focused.

var shutterOpenInterval: TimeInterval

The duration, in seconds, for which the camera’s simulated shutter is open during each frame.

### Modeling a Physical Imaging Surface

var sensorVerticalAperture: Float

The height, in millimeters, of the camera’s simulated imaging surface.

var sensorAspect: Float

The ratio of width to height for the camera’s simulated imaging surface.

var sensorEnlargement: vector_float2

The horizontal and vertical scale factors that determine the active region of the sensor.

var sensorShift: vector_float2

The horizontal and vertical offsets, in millimeters, of the center of the camera image relative to the center of the simulated lens.

var flash: vector_float3

Red, green, and blue factors to be used in brightening darker areas of the camera’s image.

var exposure: vector_float3

Red, green, and blue factors that scale each color channel in the camera’s image.

var exposureCompression: vector_float2

Two parameters that determine the brightness compression curve for colors in the camera’s image.
