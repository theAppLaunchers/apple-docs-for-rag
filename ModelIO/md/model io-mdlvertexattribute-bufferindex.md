## Discussion

A mesh may store vertex data in either a *structure of arrays* model, where data for each attribute lies in a separate vertex buffer, or in an *array of structures* model. In the latter, multiple vertex attributes share the same buffer (and thus have the same bufferIndex value), and the format and offset values (together with the stride value of a related MDLVertexBufferLayout object) identify which bytes in that buffer refer to which vertex attributes.
