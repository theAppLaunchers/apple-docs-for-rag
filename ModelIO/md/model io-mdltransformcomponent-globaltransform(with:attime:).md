Type Method

# globalTransform(with:atTime:)

Returns the absolute coordinate transformation for an object in a transform hierarchy.

``` source
optional static func globalTransform(
    with object: MDLObject,
    atTime time: TimeInterval
) -> matrix_float4x4
```

## Parameters 

`object`  

An object with a transform component.

`time`  

The time sample for which to request information.

## Return Value

The transform matrix that defines a local coordinate space relative to the root coordinate space of the hierarchy containing the object.

## Discussion

Asset file formats typically describe collections of meshes, models, or lights with a hierarchy of transforms relative to the scene containing them all. For example, if you call this method on a MDLMesh object loaded from a MDLAsset instance, Model I/O concatenates the local transformations of the mesh, its parent object, and any further parent objects to return the meshâ€™s transform relative to the root coordinate space of the scene that the asset describes.
