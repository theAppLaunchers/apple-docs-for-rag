## Discussion

By default, Model I/O renders an infinite sky above and below. If you set the groundColor property, Model I/O renders a solid color for all areas of the cube texture below this elevation. An elevation of `0.0` renders a horizon at the center elevation of the sky cube; negative values lead to a lower horizon and positive values to a higher horizon.
