## Discussion

Spherical harmonic coefficients describe the distribution of light around a light source with less high-frequency detail than a cube map texture, but they can be used more efficiently in real-time rendering. Use the generateSphericalHarmonics(fromLight:) method to create spherical harmonics data based on the light’s photometry data.

The data is an array of 32-bit floating-point values, containing three noninterleaved data sets corresponding to the red, green, and blue sets of coefficients. The array’s length is determined by the sphericalHarmonicsLevel property:

- At level 0, the array has 1 coefficient (3 values).

- At level 1, the array has 4 coefficients (3 sets of 4 values, 12 values total).

- At level 2, the array has 9 coefficients (3 sets of 9 values, 27 values total).

- At level 3, the array has 16 coefficients (3 sets of 16 values, 48 values total).

- Spherical harmonics levels beyond 3 are not supported.

For example, the code below shows how to access the second coefficient at level 2. (Note, however, that typically a renderer passes the entire data buffer to a GPU-based shader and uses equivalent shader code to extract individual coefficients.)

- Objective-C

```
func numberOfCoefficients(at level: Int) -> Int {
    return (level + 1) * (level + 1)
}
func offsetForLevel(_ level: Int) -> Int {
    return numberOfCoefficients(at: level - 1) - 1
}
guard let coeffs = light.sphericalHarmonicsCoefficients
    else { fatalError("light does not have spherical harmonics") }
let totalCount = numberOfCoefficients(at: light.sphericalHarmonicsLevel)
let offset = offsetForLevel(2) // level 2 has three sets of coefficients, at indexes 3...5
let index = 1 // get the second of 3 coefficients on level 2 (zero-based index)
coeffs.withUnsafeBytes { (bytes: UnsafePointer) -> () in
    let red = bytes[offset + index]
    let green = bytes[totalCount + offset + index]
    let blue = bytes[totalCount * 2 + offset + index]
}
```

```
float numberOfCoefficients(int level) {
    return (level + 1) * (level + 1)
}
float offsetForLevel(int level) {
    return numberOfCoefficients(level - 1) - 1
}
float *coeffs = (float *)light.sphericalHarmonicsCoefficients.bytes;
int totalCount = numberOfCoefficients(light.sphericalHarmonicsLevel);
int offset = offsetForLevel(2); // level 2 has 3 sets of coefficients, at indexes 3, 4, and 5
int index = 1; // get the second of 3 coefficients on level 2 (zero-based index)
float red = coeffs[offset + index];
float green = coeffs[totalCount + offset + index];
float blue = coeffs[totalCount * 2 + offset + index];
```
