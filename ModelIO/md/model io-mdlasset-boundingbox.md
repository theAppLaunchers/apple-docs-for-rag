var boundingBox: MDLAxisAlignedBoundingBox { get }
```

## Discussion

If an asset contains timed information, such as animated mesh data, this property provides the asset’s bounding box as of the first time sample. Use the boundingBox(atTime:) method to get bounding box information at a specific time sample.

All assets can provide bounding box information without traversing their hierarchy of objects.
