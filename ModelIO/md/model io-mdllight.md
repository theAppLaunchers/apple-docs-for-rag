``` source
class MDLLight
```

## Overview

When you load lights from an asset file using the MDLAsset class or create lights when building an asset for export, you use one or more of the concrete subclasses MDLPhysicallyPlausibleLight, MDLAreaLight, MDLPhotometricLight, or MDLLightProbe.

## Topics

### Working with Lights

func irradiance(atPoint: vector_float3) -> Unmanaged&lt;CGColor>

Returns the radiance of the light as received at a specific point in the same scene.

func irradiance(atPoint: vector_float3, colorSpace: CGColorSpace) -> Unmanaged&lt;CGColor>

Returns the radiance of the light as received at a specific point in the same scene, expressed using the specified color space.

var lightType: MDLLightType

The type of the light.

var colorSpace: String

The name of the Core Graphics color space to be used for interpreting the lightâ€™s color information.

### Constants

enum MDLLightType

Options for the shape and style of illumination provided by a light, used by the lightType property.
