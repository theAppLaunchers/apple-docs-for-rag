``` source
var sunElevation: Float { get set }
```

## Discussion

An elevation of `1.0` places the sun at the zenith (the center of the top face of the cube texture), a value of `0.0` places the sun at the nadir (the center of the bottom face), and a value of `0.5` places the sun on the horizon. The azimuth angle of the sun is fixed; to control the horizontal position of the sun relative to scene content, rotate the scene element responsible for displaying the sky cube texture.

Combine changes to this property with different turbidity and upperAtmosphereScattering to create sunset, dawn, or twilight effects.
