## Topics

### Managing Light Color and Intensity

var color: CGColor?

The color of the light source.

var lumens: Float

The total visible intensity of the light source, in lumens.

func setColorByTemperature(Float)

Sets the lightâ€™s color based on a black-body temperature.

### Managing Light Geometry

var innerConeAngle: Float

The radial angle, in degrees, of the area fully illuminated by the light.

var outerConeAngle: Float

The radial angle, in degrees, at which the illumination from a spotlight becomes zero.

### Managing Attenuation

var attenuationStartDistance: Float

The distance from the light source, in units of local coordinate space, at which its illumination begins to diminish.

var attenuationEndDistance: Float

The distance from the light source, in units of local coordinate space, at which its illumination becomes zero.
