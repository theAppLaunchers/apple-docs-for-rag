## Discussion

This buffer contains integer values where each integer is the index of a face to be treated as a hole. For example, if there are two holes in a mesh, then this buffer has two entries.

Because the number of entries in this buffer is likely to be different than the number of entries in any other vertex buffer, it shouldnâ€™t be interleaved with other data in the mesh.
