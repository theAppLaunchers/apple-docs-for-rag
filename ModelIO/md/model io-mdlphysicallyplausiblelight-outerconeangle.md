## Discussion

This property measures the angle from the light axis (the direction in which the light points; the negative z-axis of its local coordinate space) to the edge of the region affected by the light. Between this value and that of the innerConeAngle property, the lightâ€™s intensity varies linearly.

The default value is 22.5 degrees, matching the default inner cone angle and thus creating a hard-edged spotlight. Set the outer cone angle greater than the inner cone angle to create a soft-edged spotlight.
