## Discussion

If the texture contains multiple mipmap levels (the mipLevelCount value is greater than zero), this property reflects the base (largest) mipmap level.

If the texture is a cube texture (the isCube value is true), this property reflects the vertical arrangement of cube faces in the texture image data. That is, the textureâ€™s height is six times its width, and the data represents six square images for the six sides of the cube.
