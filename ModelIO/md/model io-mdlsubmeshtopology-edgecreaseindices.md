# edgeCreaseIndices

A buffer containing vertex indices that describe edges to be treated as creases during surface subdivision.

## Discussion

Each pair of entries in this buffer identifies an edge, between two connected vertices in the submesh, that is to be treated as a crease during surface subdivision. The buffer is sparse, containing only those vertex indices to be treated as creases. The corresponding entry in the edgeCreases buffer provides a sharpness value for the crease.

Because the number of entries in this buffer is likely to be different than the number of entries in any other vertex buffer, it shouldnâ€™t be interleaved with other data in the mesh.
