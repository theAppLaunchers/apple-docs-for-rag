``` source
var attenuationEndDistance: Float { get set }
```

## Discussion

At distances less than the start distance, the lightâ€™s illumination is at full intensity. At distances greater than the end distance, the light provides no illumination. At distances in between the start and end distance, the attenuationFalloffExponent property defines the transition from full illumination to no illumination.

The default distance is `2.0`.
