## Overview

A PKEraserTool object supports the deletion of content from a PKCanvasView object. The eraser toolâ€™s type determines whether the canvas removes entire items or just the portion of an item that it touches.

Create an eraser tool programmatically or display a PKToolPicker object and let the user select the eraser. Assign the resulting object to the tool property of your PKCanvasView object. The canvas uses any subsequent touch sequences to erase content on the canvas.
