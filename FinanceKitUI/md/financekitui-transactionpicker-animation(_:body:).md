## Discussion

Any modifiers applied to the content of `body` will be applied to this view, and the `animation` will only be used on the modifiers defined in the `body`.

The following code animates the opacity changing with an easeInOut animation, while the contents of MyView are animated with the implicit transactionâ€™s animation:

```
MyView(isActive: isActive)
    .animation(.easeInOut) { content in
        content.opacity(isActive ? 1.0 : 0.0)
    }
```
