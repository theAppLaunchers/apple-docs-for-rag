## Discussion

Use this modifier when you want to omit a label from one or more labeled content in your user interface. For example, the first `Toggle` in the following example hides its label:

```
VStack {
    Toggle(isOn: $toggle1) {
        Text("Toggle 1")
    }
    .labelsVisibility(.hidden)

    Toggle(isOn: $toggle2) {
        Text("Toggle 2")
    }
}
```

The `VStack` in the example above centers the first toggle’s control element in the available space, while it centers the second toggle’s combined label and control element:

Always provide a label for controls, even when you hide the label, because SwiftUI uses labels for other purposes, including accessibility.

On iOS, a `Picker` within a `Menu` hides its label by default. You can use this modifier to explicitly show the label in that context:

```
Menu {
    Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
        Text("Chocolate").tag(Flavor.chocolate)
        Text("Vanilla").tag(Flavor.vanilla)
        Text("Strawberry").tag(Flavor.strawberry)
    }
    .labelsVisibility(.visible)
}
```

Note

This modifier doesn’t work for all labels. It applies to `LabeledContent` elements, including controls like `Picker` and `Toggle`, but not to controls like a bordered button where the label is inside the button’s border.
