# AuthenticationRequiredError

An object that represents an error that occurs when authentication information is missing for the current user.

CKTool JS 1.2.15+

``` source
dictionary AuthenticationRequiredError {
 Int32 code;
 string message;
 string reason;
 string? detailedMessage;
 string? requestUuid;
 Int32? retryAfterSeconds;
 string redirectUrl;
};
```

## Overview

Some database operations require that users sign in with their Apple ID. The server returns `AuthenticationRequiredError` when the user isnâ€™t signed in or their session has expired.

In JavaScript, this is a plain object with properties as described.

In TypeScript, this type is imported in the following way:

```
import type { AuthenticationRequiredError } from "@apple/cktool.database";
```
