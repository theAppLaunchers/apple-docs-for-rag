Instance Method

# getContainers

Fetches containers for a team.

CKTool JS 1.2.15+

``` source
CancellablePromise getContainers(
 GetContainersParams params
);
```

## Parameters 

`params`  

A dictionary as described in the Discussion section.

## Return Value

A `CancellablePromise` with the following resolutions.

## Discussion

If the promise is successful, it will resolve with one of the following dictionaries:

- `{ statusCode: 200; result: ContainersResponse }`

The promise may reject and throw the following:

- `DocumentedResponseError`, if the HTTP status code is 421. The result member will be a dictionary conforming to AuthenticationRequiredError.

- `DocumentedResponseError`, if the HTTP status code is none of the above and in the range 400 to 599. The result member will be a dictionary conforming to RequestError.

- `ValidationError`, if the parameters to the method are incorrect.

- A `FetchError` descendant, if there is a problem with the network request. A reference to the request object can be used to examine the underlying cause.

## Discussion

The `params` dictionary has the following properties:

```
dictionary GetContainersParams {
  string teamId;
  Int32? limit;
  string? startingAfterKey;
  string? endingBeforeKey;
  SortDirection? sortDirection;
  string? q;
  ContainersSortByField? sortBy;
  boolean? showHidden;
}
```

- `teamId`: The team identifier. For more information, see `Team`.

- `limit`: The limit of results returned. If set to 0, all results are returned.

- `startingAfterKey`: The record key for forward pagination. If provided, the results start after the record referred to by this key.

- `endingBeforeKey`: The record key for backward pagination. If provided, the results end before the record referred to by this key.

- `sortDirection`: A value that indicates the sort order of the result set. The default value is `SortDirection.ASC`. For valid values, see `SortDirection`.

- `q`: An optional search query string. If provided, the server only returns containers with names or identifiers containing the query string. Wildcards are not supported.

- `sortBy`: An optional field to sort on. When not provided, the server uses the ID as the sort field. For valid values, see `ContainersSortByField`.

- `showHidden`: if set to true, response will contain hidden containers.

If successful, the result contains a `ContainersResponse` object. For more information about containers, see `Container`.
