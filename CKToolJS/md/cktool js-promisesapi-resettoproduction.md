Instance Method

# resetToProduction

Resets the schema of the environment to production.

CKTool JS 1.2.15+

``` source
CancellablePromise resetToProduction(
 ResetToProductionParams params
);
```

## Parameters 

`params`  

A dictionary as described in the Discussion section.

## Return Value

A `CancellablePromise` with the following resolutions.

## Discussion

If the promise is successful, it will resolve with one of the following dictionaries:

- `{ statusCode: 202 }`

The promise may reject and throw the following:

- `DocumentedResponseError`, if the HTTP status code is 421. The result member will be a dictionary conforming to AuthenticationRequiredError.

- `DocumentedResponseError`, if the HTTP status code is none of the above and in the range 400 to 599. The result member will be a dictionary conforming to RequestError.

- `ValidationError`, if the parameters to the method are incorrect.

- A `FetchError` descendant, if there is a problem with the network request. A reference to the request object can be used to examine the underlying cause.

## Discussion

The `params` dictionary has the following properties:

```
dictionary ResetToProductionParams {
  string teamId;
  string containerId;
  CKEnvironment environment;
}
```

- `teamId`: The team identifier. You can find your team identifier in the Membership tab of the Apple Developer portal at `https://developer.apple.com`.

- `containerId`: The container identifier. See `Container`.

- `environment`: The container environment. For valid values, see `CKEnvironment`.

Changes the schema of the container within the given environment to production and resets the environment. If the operation completes successfully, the server returns a success response.

Node.js example:

```

import { CKEnvironment, PromisesApi } from "@apple/cktool.database";
import { createConfiguration } from "@apple/cktool.target.nodejs";

try {
  const api = new PromisesApi({
    configuration: createConfiguration(),
    security: {
      // You can obtain a management token from the
      // Database section of CloudKit Console.
      "ManagementTokenAuth": "YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN"
    },
  });

  console.log(`Resetting schema to production...`);
  await api.resetToProduction({
    teamId: "YOUR_TEAM_ID",
    containerId: "YOUR_CONTAINER_ID",
    environment: CKEnvironment.DEVELOPMENT
  });
  console.log(`Schema reset successfully`);
} catch(ex) {
  // Handle error
}
```
