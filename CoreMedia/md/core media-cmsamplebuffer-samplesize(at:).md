``` source
func sampleSize(at sampleIndex: Int) -> Int
```

## Parameters 

`sampleIndex`  

The index of the sample to query.

## Return Value

The size of the sample.

## Discussion

If you specify a sample index that isnâ€™t in the range, the system returns `0`. It also returns `0` if the sample buffer contains no sizes, which occurs if the samples in the buffer are noncontiguous, such as noninterleaved audio, or if the sample buffer contains a CVImageBuffer.
