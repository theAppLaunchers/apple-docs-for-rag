Function

# CMAudioDeviceClockCreate(allocator:deviceUID:clockOut:)

Creates a clock that tracks playback through a Core Audio device with the specified unique identifier.

macOS 10.8+

``` source
func CMAudioDeviceClockCreate(
    allocator: CFAllocator?,
    deviceUID: CFString?,
    clockOut: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`allocator`  

Allocator for the new clock; pass kCFAllocatorDefault or `NULL` to use the default allocator.

`deviceUID`  

The unique ID of the device for which to create a clock. Pass `NULL` to create a clock that tracks the default device.

`clockOut`  

Upon return, a pointer to the newly created clock.

## Discussion

When the associated device is completely stopped, the clock continues to advance, tracking CMClockGetHostTimeClock() until the audio device starts up again.

Important

In Objective-C, youâ€™re responsible for calling CFRelease to release the returned `clockOut`.
