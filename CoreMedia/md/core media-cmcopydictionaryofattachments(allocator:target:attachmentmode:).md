iOS 4.0+iPadOS 4.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.7+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 6.0+

``` source
func CMCopyDictionaryOfAttachments(
    allocator: CFAllocator?,
    target: CMAttachmentBearer,
    attachmentMode: CMAttachmentMode
) -> CFDictionary?
```

## Parameters 

`allocator`  

Allocator for the new dictionary; pass kCFAllocatorDefault or `NULL` to use the default allocator.

`target`  

Specifies the CMAttachmentBearer whose attachments you want to obtain.

`attachmentMode`  

The mode of the attachments you want to obtain. See CMAttachmentMode for possible values.

## Return Value

A Core Foundation dictionary with all attachments identified by their keys. If no attachment is present, the dictionary is empty. Returns `NULL` for an invalid attachment mode.

## Discussion

`CMCopyDictionaryOfAttachments` is a convenience call that returns all attachments with their corresponding keys in a new CFDictionary. Given a `CVBufferRef`, `CMCopyDictionaryOfAttachments` is similar to `CVBufferGetAttachments`, except that the `CFDictionary` that `CMCopyDictionaryOfAttachments` returns isnâ€™t updated for later changes to the attachments.
