``` source
func CMBlockBufferCreateWithMemoryBlock(
    allocator structureAllocator: CFAllocator?,
    memoryBlock: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?,
    blockLength: Int,
    blockAllocator: CFAllocator?,
    customBlockSource: UnsafePointer?,
    offsetToData: Int,
    dataLength: Int,
    flags: CMBlockBufferFlags,
    blockBufferOut: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`structureAllocator`  

Allocator to use for allocating the `CMBlockBuffer` object. Pass `NULL` to use the default allocator.

`memoryBlock`  

Block of memory to hold buffered data. If `NULL`, a memory block will be allocated when needed (via a call to `CMBlockBufferAssureBlockMemory` using the provided `blockAllocator` or `customBlockSource`. If non-`NULL`, the block will be used and will be deallocated when the new `CMBlockBuffer` is finalized (i.e. released for the last time).

`blockLength`  

Overall length of the memory block in bytes. Must not be zero. This is the size of the supplied memory block or the size to allocate if `memoryBlock` is `NULL`.

`blockAllocator`  

Allocator to be used for allocating the `memoryBlock`, if `memoryBlock` is `NULL`. If `memoryBlock` is non-`NULL`, this allocator will be used to deallocate it if provided. Passing `NULL` will cause the default allocator (as set at the time of the call) to be used. Pass `kCFAllocatorNull` if no deallocation is desired.

`customBlockSource`  

If non-`NULL`, it will be used for the allocation and freeing of the memory block (the `blockAllocator` parameter is ignored). If provided, and the `memoryBlock` parameter is `NULL`, its `AllocateBlock()` routine must be non-NULL. Allocate will be called once, if successful, when the `memoryBlock` is allocated. `FreeBlock()` will be called once when the `CMBlockBuffer` is disposed.

`offsetToData`  

Offset within the `memoryBlock` at which the `CMBlockBuffer` should refer to data.

`dataLength`  

Number of relevant data bytes, starting at `offsetToData`, within the memory block.

`flags`  

Feature and control flags.

`blockBufferOut`  

Receives newly-created `CMBlockBuffer` object with a retain count of 1. Must not be `NULL`.

## Return Value

Returns `kCMBlockBufferNoErr` if successful.

## Discussion

Creates a new `CMBlockBuffer` backed by a memory block. The memory block may be statically allocated, dynamically allocated using the given allocator (or `customBlockSource`) or not yet allocated. The returned `CMBlockBuffer` may be further expanded using `CMBlockBufferAppendMemoryBlock` and/or `CMBlockBufferAppendBufferReference`.
