Structure

# CMBufferCallbacks

A structure that stores the callbacks that perform buffer operations.

``` source
struct CMBufferCallbacks
```

## Overview

With the exception of `isDataReady`, all these callbacks must always return the same result for the same arguments.

A bufferâ€™s duration, timestamps, or position relative to other buffers must not appear to change while it is in the queue. Once `isDataReady` has returned true for a given `CMBuffer`, it must always return true for that `CMBuffer`.

Durations must always be positive.

## Topics

### Properties

var compare: CMBufferCompareCallback?

This callback is called multiple times from CMBufferQueueEnqueue(_:buffer:), to perform an insertion sort.

typealias CMBufferCompareCallback

Callback that compares one `CMBuffer` with another.

typealias CMBufferGetBooleanCallback

Callback that returns a Boolean value from a `CMBuffer`.

typealias CMBufferGetTimeCallback

Callback that returns a `CMTime` from a `CMBuffer`.

var dataBecameReadyNotification: Unmanaged&lt;CFString>?

If triggers of type `kCMBufferQueueTrigger_WhenDataBecomesReady` are installed, the queue will listen for this notification on the head buffer.

var getDecodeTimeStamp: CMBufferGetTimeCallback?

Client callback that returns a `CMTime` from a `CMBuffer`.

var getDuration: CMBufferGetTimeCallback

This callback is called (once) during enqueue and dequeue operations to update the total duration of the queue.

var getPresentationTimeStamp: CMBufferGetTimeCallback?

Client callback that returns a `CMTime` from a `CMBuffer`.

var getSize: CMBufferGetSizeCallback?

var isDataReady: CMBufferGetBooleanCallback?

This callback is called from CMBufferQueueDequeueIfDataReady(_:), to ask if the buffer that is about to be dequeued is ready.

var refcon: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?

Contextual data to be passed to all callbacks.

var version: UInt32

The callback version.

### Initializers
