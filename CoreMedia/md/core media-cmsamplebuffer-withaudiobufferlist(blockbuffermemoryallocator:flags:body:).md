Instance Method

# withAudioBufferList(blockBufferMemoryAllocator:flags:body:)

Calls a closure with an audio buffer list that contains the data from a sample buffer and a block buffer backing the audio buffers.

``` source
func withAudioBufferList(
    blockBufferMemoryAllocator: CFAllocator? = kCFAllocatorDefault,
    flags: CMSampleBuffer.Flags = [],
    body: (UnsafeMutableAudioBufferListPointer, CMBlockBuffer) throws -> R
) throws -> R
```

## Parameters 

`blockBufferMemoryAllocator`  

An allocator to use for the memory block held by a CMBlockBuffer APIs.

`flags`  

Optional flags that control the operation.

`body`  

A closure the system calls that contains a pointer to an AudioBufferList and the block buffer that backs its audio buffers.

## Discussion

The system may not copy the data, depending on its contiguity and 16-byte alignment. It guarantees the buffers it places in the AudioBufferList are contiguous.

The system returns 16-byte-aligned buffers if you pass the audioBufferListAssure16ByteAlignment flag.
