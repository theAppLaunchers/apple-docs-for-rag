# CMBlockBufferCustomBlockSource

A structure to support custom memory allocation and deallocation for a block used in a block buffer.

``` source
struct CMBlockBufferCustomBlockSource
```

## Overview

This structure allows a client to provide a custom facility for obtaining the memory block to be used in a `CMBlockBuffer`. You use this structure with functions that accept a memory block allocator.

## Topics

### Initializers

init()

init(version: UInt32, AllocateBlock: ((UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, Int) -> UnsafeMutableRawPointer?)?, FreeBlock: ((UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, UnsafeMutableRawPointer, Int) -> Void)?, refCon: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?)

### Properties

var AllocateBlock: ((UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, Int) -> UnsafeMutableRawPointer?)?

The function to allocate memory.

var FreeBlock: ((UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, UnsafeMutableRawPointer, Int) -> Void)?

A function to call once when the `CMBlockBuffer` is disposed.

var refCon: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?

Contextual information passed to both the allocate and free function calls.

var version: UInt32
