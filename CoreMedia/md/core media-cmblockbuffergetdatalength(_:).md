``` source
func CMBlockBufferGetDataLength(_ theBuffer: CMBlockBuffer) -> Int
```

## Parameters 

`theBuffer`  

`CMBlockBuffer` to examine.

## Return Value

Returns the total data length available via this `CMBlockBuffer`, or zero if it is empty, `NULL` if invalid.

## Discussion

Obtains the total data length reachable via a `CMBlockBuffer`. This total is the sum of the `dataLengths` of the `CMBlockBuffer's` memoryBlocks and buffer references. Note that the `dataLengths` are the portions of those constituents that this `CMBlockBuffer` subscribes to. This `CMBlockBuffer` presents a contiguous range of offsets from zero to its `totalDataLength` as returned by this routine.

func CMBlockBufferIsRangeContiguous(CMBlockBuffer, atOffset: Int, length: Int) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the specified range within a block buffer is contiguous.

func CMBlockBufferIsEmpty(CMBlockBuffer) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the buffer is empty.
