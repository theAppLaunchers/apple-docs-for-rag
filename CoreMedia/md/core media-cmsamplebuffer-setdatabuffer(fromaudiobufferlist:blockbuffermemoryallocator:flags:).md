Instance Method

# setDataBuffer(fromAudioBufferList:blockBufferMemoryAllocator:flags:)

Creates a block buffer that contains a copy of the data from an audio buffer list, and sets it as the sample bufferâ€™s data.

``` source
func setDataBuffer(
    fromAudioBufferList bufferList: UnsafePointer,
    blockBufferMemoryAllocator: CFAllocator? = kCFAllocatorDefault,
    flags: CMSampleBuffer.Flags = []
) throws
```

## Parameters 

`bufferList`  

The audio buffer list from which to copy the data.

`blockBufferMemoryAllocator`  

An allocator to use for the memory block that the block buffer holds.

`flags`  

Optional flags that control the operation.

## Discussion

Pass the audioBufferListAssure16ByteAlignment flag to have the system create 16-byte-aligned buffers.
