Function

# CMSampleBufferGetDecodeTimeStamp(\_:)

Returns the decode timestamp that’s the earliest numerically of all the samples in a sample buffer.

``` source
func CMSampleBufferGetDecodeTimeStamp(_ sbuf: CMSampleBuffer) -> CMTime
```

## Parameters 

`sbuf`  

The `CMSampleBuffer` being interrogated.

## Return Value

The numerically earliest sample decode timestamp in the `CMSampleBuffer` or `kCMTimeInvalid` if there is an error.

## Discussion

The returned decode timestamp is always the decode timestamp of the first sample in the buffer, because even out-of-presentation-order samples are expected to be in decode order in the buffer.
