Function

# CMBlockBufferAppendBufferReference(\_:targetBBuf:offsetToData:dataLength:flags:)

Adds a reference to an existing block buffer.

``` source
func CMBlockBufferAppendBufferReference(
    _ theBuffer: CMBlockBuffer,
    targetBBuf: CMBlockBuffer,
    offsetToData: Int,
    dataLength: Int,
    flags: CMBlockBufferFlags
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`theBuffer`  

The existing `CMBlockBuffer`. The target `CMBlockBuffer` will be added to the memory being managed by `theBuffer` (the existing `CMBlockBuffer`). Must not be `NULL`.

`targetBBuf`  

The target `CMBlockBuffer`. The target `CMBlockBuffer` will be added to the memory managed by the `theBuffer` (the existing`CMBlockBuffer`).This parameter must not be `NULL`. Unless the `kCMBlockBufferPermitEmptyReferenceFlag` is passed, the target `CMBlockBuffer` must not be empty and it must have a data length at least large enough to supply the data subset specified (i.e. `offsetToData` + `dataLength` bytes).

`offsetToData`  

The reference maintained by the existing `CMBlockBuffer` will begin after this offset within the target `CMBlockBuffer`.

`dataLength`  

Number of relevant data bytes, starting at `offsetToData`, within the target `CMBlockBuffer`. If zero, the target bufferâ€™s total available `dataLength` (starting at offsetToData) will be referenced.

`flags`  

Feature and control flags.

## Return Value

Returns `kCMBlockBufferNoErr` if successful.

## Discussion

Adds a buffer reference of (a possibly subset portion of) another `CMBlockBuffer`, the target `CMBlockBuffer`, to an existing `CMBlockBuffer`. The existing `CMBlockBuffer's` total data length will be increased by the specified `dataLength`. Note that append operations are not thread safe, so care must be taken when appending to block buffers that are used by multiple threads.
