``` source
func CMSampleBufferGetSampleAttachmentsArray(
    _ sbuf: CMSampleBuffer,
    createIfNecessary: Bool
) -> CFArray?
```

## Parameters 

`sbuf`  

The `CMSampleBuffer` being interrogated.

`createIfNecessary`  

Specifies whether an empty array should be created (if there are no sample attachments yet).

## Return Value

A reference to the `CMSampleBuffer's` immutable array of mutable sample attachments dictionaries (one dictionary per sample in the `CMSampleBuffer`). `NULL` is returned if there is an error

## Discussion

Attachments can then be added/removed directly by the caller, using Core Foundation APIs. On return, the caller doesnâ€™t own the returned array of attachments dictionaries, and must retain it if the caller needs to maintain a reference to it. If there are no sample attachments yet, and createIfNecessary is true, a new `CFArray` containing N empty `CFMutableDictionaries` is returned (where N is the number of samples in the `CMSampleBuffer`), so that attachments can be added directly by the caller. If there are no sample attachments yet, and `createIfNecessary` is false, `NULL` is returned. Once the `CFArray` has been created, subsequent calls will return it, even if there are still no sample attachments in the array.
