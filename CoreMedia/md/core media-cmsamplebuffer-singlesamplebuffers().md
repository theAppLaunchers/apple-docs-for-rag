``` source
func singleSampleBuffers() throws -> CMSampleBuffer.SingleSampleBuffers
```

## Return Value

All samples from the buffer.

## Discussion

The system creates temporary sample buffers for individual samples that refer to the sample data and containing its timing, size, and attachments.

If there are no sample sizes in the provided sample buffer, the system throws a kCMSampleBufferError_CannotSubdivide error. This happens, for example, if the samples in the buffer are noncontiguous, such as noninterleaved audio.
