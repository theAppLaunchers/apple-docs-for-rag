``` source
func CMSampleBufferCopySampleBufferForRange(
    allocator: CFAllocator?,
    sampleBuffer sbuf: CMSampleBuffer,
    sampleRange: CFRange,
    sampleBufferOut: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`allocator`  

The allocator to use for allocating the `CMSampleBuffer` object. Pass `kCFAllocatorDefault` to use the default allocator.

`sbuf`  

The sample buffer containing the original samples.

`sampleRange`  

The range of samples to copy from `sbuf`, where sample 0 is the first sample in the `sbuf`.\`\`

`sampleBufferOut`  

On output, points to the newly created `CMSampleBuffer`.

## Return Value

A result code. See Sample Buffer Error Codes.

## Discussion

Note

Samples containing non-interleaved audio arenâ€™t supported.
