Function

# CMSampleBufferGetSampleSizeArray(\_:entryCount:arrayToFill:entriesNeededOut:)

Retrieves an array of sample sizes that represents each sample in a sample buffer.

``` source
func CMSampleBufferGetSampleSizeArray(
    _ sbuf: CMSampleBuffer,
    entryCount sizeArrayEntries: CMItemCount,
    arrayToFill sizeArrayOut: UnsafeMutablePointer?,
    entriesNeededOut sizeArrayEntriesNeededOut: UnsafeMutablePointer?
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`sbuf`  

The `CMSampleBuffer` being interrogated.

`sizeArrayEntries`  

Number of entries in `sizeArray`.

`sizeArrayOut`  

Reference to an array of `size_t` values to receive the sample sizes.

`sizeArrayEntriesNeededOut`  

Number of entries needed for the result.

## Return Value

A result code. See Sample Buffer Error Codes.

## Discussion

If only one size entry is returned, all samples in the buffer are of this size. The `sizeArrayOut` must be allocated by the caller, and the number of entries allocated must be passed in `sizeArrayEntries`. If `sizeArrayOut` is NULL, sizeArrayEntriesNeededOut will return the required number of entries. Similarly, if `sizeArrayEntries` is too small, CMSampleBuffer will be returned, and `sizeArrayEntriesNeededOut` will return the required number of entries. The caller can then make an appropriately-sized `sizeArrayOut` and call again. For example, the caller might pass the address of a `size_t` variable on the stack (as sizeArrayOut), and 1 as `sizeArrayEntries`. If all samples are the same size (or thereâ€™s only one sample in the `CMSampleBuffer`), this call would succeed. If not, it will fail, and will return the number of entries required in `sizeArrayEntriesNeededOut`. Only in this case (multiple samples of different sizes) will the caller need to allocate an array. 0 entries will be returned if the samples in the buffer are non-contiguous (for example, non-interleaved audio, where the channel values for a single sample are scattered through the buffer). If there are no sample sizes in this `CMSampleBuffer`, CMSampleBuffer will be returned, and `*sizeArrayEntriesNeededOut` will be set to 0. This will be true, for example, if the samples in the buffer are non-contiguous (for example, non-interleaved audio, where the channel values for a single sample are scattered through the buffer), or if this `CMSampleBuffer` contains a `CVImageBuffer`.
