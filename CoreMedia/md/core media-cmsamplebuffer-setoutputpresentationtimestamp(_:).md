``` source
func setOutputPresentationTimeStamp(_ pts: CMTime) throws
```

## Parameters 

`pts`  

The output presentation timestamp.

## Discussion

This value is the time at which the system should present the decoded, trimmed, stretched and possibly reversed samples. By default, retrieving the value of the `outputPresentationTimeStamp` property calculates the time dynamically. You can use this method to set a specific value for `outputPresentationTimeStamp`.

For general forward playback in a scaled edit, calculate the timestamp as follows:

`((PresentationTimeStamp + TrimDurationAtStart - EditStartMediaTime) / EditSpeedMultiplier) + EditStartTrackTime`

For general reversed playback, calculate the timestamp as shown below:

`((PresentationTimeStamp + Duration - TrimDurationAtEnd - EditStartMediaTime) / EditSpeedMultiplier) + EditStartTrackTime`
