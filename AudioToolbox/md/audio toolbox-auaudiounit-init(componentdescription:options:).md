Initializer

# init(componentDescription:options:)

Synchronously initializes a new audio unit object.

iOS 9.0+iPadOS 9.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.11+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
init(
    componentDescription: AudioComponentDescription,
    options: AudioComponentInstantiationOptions = []
) throws
```

## Parameters 

`componentDescription`  

The component to instantiate.

`options`  

Options for loading the unit in-process or out-of-process.

## Return Value

An initialized audio unit, or `nil` if initialization failed.

## Discussion

This is the designated initializer.

A single audio unit subclass may implement multiple audio unitsâ€”for example, an effect that can also function as a generator, or a cluster of related effects.

Handling Errors in Swift

In Swift, this API is imported as an initializer and is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure.

You call this method in a `try` expression and handle any errors in the `catch` clauses of a `do` statement, as described in Error Handling in The Swift Programming Language and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.
