## Overview

Each audio queue has an associated set of audio queue buffers. To allocate a buffer, call the AudioQueueAllocateBuffer(_:_:_:) function. To dispose of a buffer, call the AudioQueueFreeBuffer(_:_:) function.

If using a VBR compressed audio data format, you may want to instead use the `AudioQueueAllocateBufferWithPacketDescriptions` function. This function allocates a buffer with additional space for packet descriptions. The `mPacketDescriptionCapacity`, `mPacketDescriptions`, and `mPacketDescriptionCount` fields may only be used with buffers allocated with `AudioQueueAllocateBufferWithPacketDescriptions`.

## Topics

### Initializers

init(mAudioDataBytesCapacity: UInt32, mAudioData: UnsafeMutableRawPointer, mAudioDataByteSize: UInt32, mUserData: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, mPacketDescriptionCapacity: UInt32, mPacketDescriptions: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;AudioStreamPacketDescription>?, mPacketDescriptionCount: UInt32)

### Instance Properties

var mAudioData: UnsafeMutableRawPointer

The audio data owned the audio queue buffer. The buffer address cannot be changed.

var mAudioDataByteSize: UInt32

The number of bytes of valid audio data in the audio queue bufferâ€™s `mAudioData` field, initially set to `0`. Your callback must set this value for a playback audio queue; for recording, the recording audio queue sets the value.

var mAudioDataBytesCapacity: UInt32

The size of the audio queue buffer, in bytes. This size is set when a buffer is allocated and cannot be changed.

var mPacketDescriptionCapacity: UInt32

The maximum number of packet descriptions that can be stored in the `mPacketDescriptions` field.

var mPacketDescriptionCount: UInt32

The number of valid packet descriptions in the buffer. You set this value when providing buffers for playback. The audio queue sets this value when returning buffers from a recording queue.

var mPacketDescriptions: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;AudioStreamPacketDescription>?

An array of `AudioStreamPacketDescription` structures for the buffer.

var mUserData: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?

The custom data structure you specify, for use by your callback function, when creating a recording or playback audio queue.
