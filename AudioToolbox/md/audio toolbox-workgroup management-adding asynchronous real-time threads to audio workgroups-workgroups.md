# Adding Asynchronous Real-Time Threads to Audio Workgroups

Optimize system performance by adding real-time audio threads that run asynchronously to the I/O thread to custom audio workgroups.

## Overview

If your app creates auxiliary real-time threads that run asynchronously to the audio server’s I/O thread, add them to a custom audio workgroup. Doing so informs the system of these threads and their deadlines, which helps it optimize performance.

### Create Workgroups

If your auxiliary real-time threads run asynchronously to the I/O thread, you don’t add them to the audio device workgroup, but instead create a new audio workgroup. For each thread that has a unique work interval, create a new audio workgroup for it by calling AudioWorkIntervalCreate. Your workgroup may contain multiple threads, but only one is the primary thread and is responsible for controlling the others. In this thread, call os_workgroup_interval_start in each work cycle. The start time that you pass to this function can be the present, or a time in the past if you know exactly when the system scheduled your work cycle to begin. The function’s deadline argument has to be a timestamp value greater than the start time.

```
#include 
#import 

// This workgroup attribute isn't currently used. Set it to NULL.
os_workgroup_attr_t _Nullable attr = nullptr;

// One nanosecond in seconds.
constexpr static double kOneNanosecond = 1.0e9;

// The I/O interval time in seconds.
constexpr static double kIOIntervalTime = 0.020;

// The clock identifier that specifies interval timestamps.
os_clockid_t clockId = OS_CLOCK_MACH_ABSOLUTE_TIME;

// Create a workgroup interval.
os_workgroup_interval_t _Nullable workgroup =
    AudioWorkIntervalCreate("My Work Interval", clockId, attr);

void realtimeThreadFunction() {

    // Join this thread to the workgroup.
    if (!joinThisThreadToWorkgroup(workgroup)) {
        // Early return, unable to add this thread to the workgroup
        return;
    }

    // Get the mach time info.
    struct mach_timebase_info timeBaseInfo;
    mach_timebase_info(&timeBaseInfo);

    // The frequency of the clock is: (timeBaseInfo.denom / timeBaseInfo.numer) * kOneNanosecond
    const auto nanoSecFrequency = static_cast(timeBaseInfo.denom) / static_cast(timeBaseInfo.numer);
    const auto frequency = nanoSecFrequency * kOneNanosecond;

    // Convert the interval time in seconds to mach time length.
    const auto intervalMachLength = static_cast(kIOIntervalTime * frequency);
    while (true) {
        // Get the current host time.
        const auto currentTime = mach_absolute_time();
        const auto deadline = currentTime + intervalMachLength;

        // Call os_workgroup_interval_start each time the thread begins a work cycle
        int result = os_workgroup_interval_start(workgroup, currentTime, deadline, nullptr);

        if (result != 0) {
            // Something went wrong.
        }

        // Perform some custom DSP processing.
        customAudioDSP();

        // Call os_workgroup_interval_finish on completion of each a work cycle.
        result = os_workgroup_interval_finish(workgroup, nullptr);
    }
}

// Return true if the method joined the thread to the workgroup.
bool joinThisThreadToWorkgroup(os_workgroup_t workgroup) {
    // Join this thread to the workgroup.
    const int result = os_workgroup_join(workgroup, &joinToken);
    if (result == 0) {
        // Success.
    } else if (result == EALREADY) {
        // The thread is already part of a workgroup that can't be
        // nested in the the specified workgroup.
        return false;
    } else if (result == EINVAL) {
        // The workgroup has been canceled.
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

If your app has other real-time threads that render to this audio workgroup’s deadline, you can join them to the audio workgroup as shown in the example below.

```
#import 

#import 

// The workgroup interval created in the previous example.
os_workgroup_interval_t workgroup = ...

void realtimeThreadFunction(os_workgroup_t workgroup) {

    // Join this thread to the workgroup.
    if (!joinThisThreadToWorkgroup(workgroup)) {
        // Early return, unable to add this thread to the workgroup
        return;
    }

    // Work cycle.
    while (threadShouldRun) {
        // Typically, wait on a semaphore.
        waitForWork();
        // The controlling thread signaled this thread to stop.
        if (threadShouldRun) {
            performCustomAudioDSPWorkUnit();
            // Typically, signal a semaphore.
            signalWorkComplete();
        }
    }

    // Before exiting the thread, leave the workgroup.
    os_workgroup_leave(workgroup, &joinToken);
}
```
