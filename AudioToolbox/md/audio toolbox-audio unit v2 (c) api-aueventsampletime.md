# AUEventSampleTime

Expresses time as a sample count.

## Overview

Callers of the AUScheduleParameterBlock and AUScheduleMIDIEventBlock blocks can pass the `AUEventSampleTimeImmediate` value to indicate that the event should be rendered as soon as possible (in the next cycle). A caller may also add a small (less than 4096) sample frame offset to this constant.

Note

The base AUAudioUnit implementation translates the `AUEventSampleTimeImmediate` constant to a true AUEventSampleTime value. Subclasses will not see this value.
