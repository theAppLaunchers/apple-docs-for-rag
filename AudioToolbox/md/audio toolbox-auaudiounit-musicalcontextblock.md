## Discussion

An audio unit accessing this property should cache it in realtime-safe storage before beginning to render.

This version 3 property is bridged to the version 2 HostCallback_GetBeatAndTempo and HostCallback_GetMusicalTimeLocation callback members in the `kAudioUnitProperty_HostCallbacks` API.
