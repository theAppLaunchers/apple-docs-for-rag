Function

# AudioFileStreamParseBytes(\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Passes audio file stream data to the parser.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.5+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
func AudioFileStreamParseBytes(
    _ inAudioFileStream: AudioFileStreamID,
    _ inDataByteSize: UInt32,
    _ inData: UnsafeRawPointer?,
    _ inFlags: AudioFileStreamParseFlags
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`inAudioFileStream`  

The ID of the parser to which you wish to pass data. The parser ID is returned by the AudioFileStreamOpen(_:_:_:_:_:) function.

`inDataByteSize`  

The number of bytes of data to be parsed.

`inData`  

The data to be parsed.

`inFlags`  

An audio file stream flag. If there is a discontinuity from the last data you passed to the parser, set the discontinuity flag.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

Streamed audio file data is expected to be passed to the parser in the same sequence in which it appears in the audio file, from the beginning of the audio file stream, without gaps. However, if you called the AudioFileStreamSeek(_:_:_:_:) function, the parser assumes that the data passed to the AudioFileStreamParseBytes(_:_:_:_:) function starts from the byte offset returned by the AudioFileStreamSeek(_:_:_:_:) function.

When you provide data to the parser, the parser looks for property data and audio data packets and, when it has data ready, calls your AudioFileStream_PropertyListenerProc and AudioFileStream_PacketsProc callback functions to process the data. You should provide at least more than a single packetâ€™s worth of audio file data, but it is better to provide a few packets to a few seconds data at a time.
