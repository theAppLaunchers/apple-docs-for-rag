enum AudioBalanceFadeType

## Overview

These constants are used as values for the `mType` field of the AudioBalanceFade structure.

## Topics

### Types

case equalPower

Overall loudness remains constant, but gain can exceed 1.0. The gain value is 1.0 when the balance and fade are in the center. From there they can increase to +3dB (1.414) and decrease to silence.

case maxUnityGain

Ensures that the overall gain value never exceeds 1.0 by fading one channel as the other channelâ€™s level rises. This can reduce overall loudness when the balance or fade is not in the center.
