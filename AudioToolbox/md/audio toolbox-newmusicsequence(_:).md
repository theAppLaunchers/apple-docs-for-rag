iOS 5.0+iPadOS 5.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
func NewMusicSequence(_ outSequence: UnsafeMutablePointer) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`outSequence`  

On output, the new, empty music sequence.

## Return Value

A result code.

## Discussion

A new music sequence has only a tempo track, with a default tempo of 120 beats-per-minute. The default sequence type is beat-based. For the various sequence types, see MusicSequenceType.

To direct the output of a music sequence to an audio processing graph, use the MusicSequenceSetAUGraph(_:_:) function. To direct the output instead to a MIDI endpoint, use the MusicSequenceSetMIDIEndpoint(_:_:) function.

To direct the output of a specific music track, use the MusicTrackSetDestNode(_:_:) and MusicTrackSetDestMIDIEndpoint(_:_:) functions, described in `MusicTrack`.
