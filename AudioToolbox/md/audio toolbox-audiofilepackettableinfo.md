## Overview

Some data formats might have packets with contents that are not completely valid, but that represent priming or remainder frames not intended for playback. For example, a file with 100 packets of AAC is nominally 1024 \* 100 = 102400 frames of data. However, the first 2112 frames might be priming frames.

A number of remainder frames might be added to pad out to a full packet of 1024 frames. Discard the priming and remainder frames.

The total number of packets in the file times the frames per packet (or counting each packetâ€™s frames individually for a variable frames per packet format) minus `mPrimingFrames`, minus `mRemainderFrames`, should equal `mNumberValidFrames`.

## Topics

### Initializers

init()

init(mNumberValidFrames: Int64, mPrimingFrames: Int32, mRemainderFrames: Int32)

### Instance Properties

var mNumberValidFrames: Int64

The number of valid frames in the file.

var mPrimingFrames: Int32

The number of invalid frames at the beginning of the file.

var mRemainderFrames: Int32

The number of invalid frames at the end of the file.
