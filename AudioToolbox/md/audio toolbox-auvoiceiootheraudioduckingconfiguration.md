``` source
struct AUVoiceIOOtherAudioDuckingConfiguration
```

## Overview

Use this structure to specify whether to enable advanced ducking and set the ducking level of other non-voice audio in a voice chat. Advanced ducking ducks other non-voice audio based on the presence of voice activity from local and remote chat participants. Setting a higher level of ducking could increase the clarity of voice chat.

If you donâ€™t set this value, the default ducking configuration disables advanced ducking and sets the ducking level to AUVoiceIOOtherAudioDuckingLevel.default.

## Topics

var mDuckingLevel: AUVoiceIOOtherAudioDuckingLevel
