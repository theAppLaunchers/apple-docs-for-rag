## Discussion

This category disables playback (audio output) and disables recording (audio input).

Audio processing does not normally continue when your app is in the background. However, when your app moves to the background, you can request additional time to complete processing. for more information, see Internationalizing Your App in App Programming Guide for iOS.

This category is equivalent to the audioProcessing category provided in the AVFoundation framework.
