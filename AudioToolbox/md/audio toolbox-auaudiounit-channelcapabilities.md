## Discussion

Array elements are NSNumber values containing integers.

The array index alternates between input and output counts, in ascending order of input/output channelsâ€”for example: \[0\] = first input count, \[1\] = first output count, \[2\] = second input count, \[3\] = second output count, etc.

Positive array values specify the number of input and/or output channels supported.

Negative array values have particular meanings. An input/output value pair of `(-1, -1)` (i.e. \[0\] = -1, \[1\] = -1) indicates that any number of channels are supported, as long as they are the same number for both input and output. An input/output value pair combination of `-1` and `-2` (e.g. \[0\] = -1, \[1\] = -2) also indicates that any number of channels are supported, but without the requirement that the input and output counts are the same. A negative value less than `-2` (e.g. \[0\] = -16) specifies a total number of channels across every bus in that scope, regardless of how many channels are set on any particular bus.

An array value of `0` (e.g. \[0\] = 0) specifies that the input/output channel is not applicable (though typically only used for input channels).

The table below shows a sample selection of valid input and output channel combinations:

| Array Index | Integer Value | Meaning |
|----|----|----|
| \[0\]  \[1\] | -1  -1 | First input/output count.  Any number of input and output channels, requiring that the numbers match. This is the default case. |
| \[2\]  \[3\] | -1  -2 | Second input/output count.  Any number of input and output channels, without requiring that the numbers match. |
| \[4\]  \[5\] | 2  6 | Third input/output count.  Exactly two input channels, exactly six output channels. |
| \[6\]  \[7\] | -1  2 | Fourth input/output count.  Any number of input channels, exactly two output channels. |
| \[8\]  \[9\] | 0  1 | Fifth input/output count.  No input channels, exactly one output channel. |
| \[10\]  \[11\] | -4  -8 | Sixth input/output count.  Up to four input channels, up to eight output channels. |

This version 3 property is bridged to the version 2 `kAudioUnitProperty_SupportedNumChannels` API.
