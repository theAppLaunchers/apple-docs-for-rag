``` source
func MusicEventIteratorHasPreviousEvent(
    _ inIterator: MusicEventIterator,
    _ outHasPrevEvent: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`inIterator`  

The music event iterator whose state you want to know about.

`outHasPrevEvent`  

On output, `true` (nonzero) if there is an event closer to the start of the music track than the music event iterator’s current position; `false` (zero) otherwise.

## Return Value

A result code.
