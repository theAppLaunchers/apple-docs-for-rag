Global Variable

# kAudioServicesPropertyCompletePlaybackIfAppDies

A `UInt32` value, where `1` means that the audio file specified by a system sound passed in the `inSpecifier` parameter should finish playing even if the client application terminates. This could happen, for example, if the user quits or the application terminates unexpectedly while the sound is playing. The default is `0`. That is, you must explicitly set this propertyâ€™s value to `1` if you want the sound to complete playing even if the application terminates.
