### Discussion

Install this callback in an audio queue by calling the AudioQueueAddPropertyListener(_:_:_:_:) function. For example, say you want your application to be notified, after you call the AudioQueueStop(_:_:) function with the `inImmedate` parameter set to `false`, that audio has finished playing. Perform these steps:

1.  Define this property listener callback function to listen for changes to the kAudioQueueProperty_IsRunning property.

2.  Install this callback, using the AudioQueueAddPropertyListener(_:_:_:_:) function, in the playback audio queue that you want to monitor.
