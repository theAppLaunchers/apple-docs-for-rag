# TryCapture

A regex component that attempts to transform a matched substring, saving the result if successful and backtracking if the transformation fails.

## Overview

You use a `TryCapture` component to capture part of a match as a transformed value, when a failure to transform should mean the regex continues matching, backtracking from that point if necessary.

The code below demonstrates using `TryCapture` to include a test that the `Double` value of a capture is over a limit. In the example, `regex` matches a dollar sign (`"$"`) followed by one or more digits, a period (`"."`), and then two additional digits, as long as that pattern appears at the end of the line. The `TryCapture` block wraps the digits and period, capturing that part of the match separately and passing it to its `transform` closure. That closure converts the captured portion of the match, converts it to a `Double`, and only returns a non-`nil` value if it is over the transaction limit.

```
let transactions = """
    CREDIT     109912311421    Payroll   $69.73
    CREDIT     105912031123    Travel   $121.54
    DEBIT      107733291022    Refund    $8.42
    """
let transactionLimit = 100.0

let regex = Regex {
    "$"
    TryCapture {
        OneOrMore(.digit)
        "."
        Repeat(.digit, count: 2)
    } transform: { str -> Double? in
        let value = Double(str)!
        if value > transactionLimit {
            return value
        }
        return nil
    }
    Anchor.endOfLine
}
```

When the `TryCapture` blockâ€™s `transform` closure processes the three different amounts in the list of transactions, it only returns a non-`nil` value for the \$121.54 transaction. Even though the capture returns an optional `Double` value, the captured value is non-optional.

```
// The type of each match's output is `(Substring, Double)`.
for match in transactions.matches(of: regex) {
    print("Transaction amount: \(match.1)")
}
// Prints "Transaction amount: 121.54"
```

Throwing an error from a `transform` closure aborts matching and propagates the error out to the caller. If you want to capture the `nil` results of a failable transformation, instead of continuing a search, use Capture instead of `TryCapture`.
