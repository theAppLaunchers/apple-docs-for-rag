Instance Method

# testSuite(\_:didFailWithDescription:inFile:atLine:)

Notifies the observer when a test suite reports a failure.

``` source
optional func testSuite(
    _ testSuite: XCTestSuite,
    didFailWithDescription description: String,
    inFile filePath: String?,
    atLine lineNumber: Int
)
```

Deprecated

Use testSuite(_:didRecord:) instead. If you implement both this method and testSuite(_:didRecord:), the test will not call this method.

## Parameters 

`testSuite`  

The test suite that failed. Additional information about the suite can be retrieved from the test suiteâ€™s associated XCTestRun.

`description`  

A textual description of the failure.

`filePath`  

The path to the file in the failure occurred, or `nil` if the file path is unknown.

`lineNumber`  

The line number on which the failure was reported.

## Discussion

Suite failures are most commonly reported during suite-level setup and teardown. Failures during tests are reported for the test case alone and are not reported as suite failures.
