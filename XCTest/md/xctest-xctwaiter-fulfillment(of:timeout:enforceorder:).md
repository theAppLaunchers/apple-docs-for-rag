``` source
@nonobjc
class func fulfillment(
    of expectations: [XCTestExpectation],
    timeout seconds: TimeInterval = .infinity,
    enforceOrder enforceOrderOfFulfillment: Bool = false
) async -> XCTWaiter.Result
```

## Parameters 

`expectations`  

An array of expectations the test must satisfy.

`seconds`  

The time, in seconds, the test allows for the fulfillment of the expectations.

`enforceOrderOfFulfillment`  

If true, the test must satisfy the expectations in the order they appear in the array.

## Return Value

A value describing the outcome of waiting for `expectations`.

## Discussion

Use this Concurrency safe alternative to wait(for:timeout:enforceOrder:) in your Swift code. A call to wait(for:timeout:enforceOrder:) runs synchronously and blocks the calling thread, which can cause deadlocks or priority inversion.

Expectations can only appear in the array once. The call may return before the timeout if the test fulfills all the expectations you provide.

Note

If you donâ€™t specify a timeout when calling this function, enable test timeouts to prevent unfulfilled expectation from hanging the test.

The test discards the waiter after the wait completes.
