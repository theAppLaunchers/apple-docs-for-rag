# Defining Test Cases and Test Methods

Add test cases and test methods to a test target to confirm that your code performs as expected.

## Overview

Add tests to your Xcode project by writing one or more test methods, each of which verifies a specific aspect of your code. Group related test methods into test cases, each of which is a subclass of XCTestCase.

To add tests to your project:

- Create a new subclass of XCTestCase within a test target.

- Add one or more test methods to the test case.

- Add one or more test assertions to each test method.

A test method is an instance method on an XCTestCase subclass, with no parameters, no return value, and a name that begins with the lowercase word *test*. Test methods are automatically detected by the XCTest framework in Xcode.

Listing 1. Example test case and test method

- Swift
- Objective-C

```
class TableValidationTests: XCTestCase {
    /// Tests that a new table instance has zero rows and columns.
    func testEmptyTableRowAndColumnCount() {
        let table = Table()
        XCTAssertEqual(table.rowCount, 0, "Row count was not zero.")
        XCTAssertEqual(table.columnCount, 0, "Column count was not zero.")
    }
}
```

```
```

This example defines an XCTestCase subclass, `TableValidationTests`, with a single test method, `testEmptyTableRowAndColumnCount()`. This test method creates a new instance of a class called `Table`, and checks that its `rowCount` and `columnCount` properties are both equal to 0 after initialization.

Tip

Test case and test method names are used in Xcodeâ€™s test navigator and integration reports to group and identify tests.

To help clarify the organization of your tests, give each test case a name that summarizes the tests within it, such as `TableValidationTests`, `NetworkReachabilityTests`, or `JSONParsingTests`.

To help identify failing tests, give each test method a name that makes it clear what is tested by that method, such as `testEmptyTableRowAndColumnCount()`, `testUnreachableURLAccessThrowsAnError()`, or `testUserJSONFeedParsing()`.

### Asserting Test Conditions

You can check (or *assert*) conditions inside test methods to make sure that your code is behaving as expected. Use the `XCTAssert` family of functions to check for Boolean conditions, `nil` or non-`nil` values, expected values, errors, or thrown exceptions.

For example, Listing 1 above uses the XCTAssertEqual macro to assert that two integers have the same value.
