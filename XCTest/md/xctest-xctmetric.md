Protocol

# XCTMetric

A protocol that defines the methods that objects must provide when gathering metrics during performance tests.

``` source
protocol XCTMetric : NSCopying, NSObjectProtocol
```

## Overview

Objects that gather metrics during performance tests must conform to `XCTMetric`. Before you create your own conforming objects, first use the metrics classes that `XCTest` supplies.

## Topics

### Recording Metrics

func willBeginMeasuring()

A method that XCTest calls when itâ€™s ready to begin running the measured code.

func didStopMeasuring()

A method that XCTest calls when it has finished running the measured code.

### Reporting Gathered Metrics

func reportMeasurements(from: XCTPerformanceMeasurementTimestamp, to: XCTPerformanceMeasurementTimestamp) throws -> [XCTPerformanceMeasurement]

Reports the measurements gathered for a metric between specific timestamps.

**Required**
