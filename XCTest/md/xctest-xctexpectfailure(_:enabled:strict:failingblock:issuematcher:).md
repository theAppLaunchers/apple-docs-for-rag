Function

# XCTExpectFailure(\_:enabled:strict:failingBlock:issueMatcher:)

Instructs the test to expect a failure in an assertion in the provided block of code, with parameters to customize expected failure checking and handling.

``` source
func XCTExpectFailure(
    _ failureReason: String? = nil,
    enabled: Bool? = nil,
    strict: Bool? = nil,
    failingBlock: () throws -> R,
    issueMatcher: ((XCTIssue) -> Bool)? = nil
) rethrows -> R
```

## Parameters 

`failureReason`  

An optional string that describes why the test expects a failure.

`enabled`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the test checks for the expected failure.

`strict`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether the test reports an error if the expected failure doesnâ€™t occur.

`failingBlock`  

A block of test code and assertions where the test expects a failure.

`issueMatcher`  

A block of code that determines whether the test issue fulfills the expected failure.

## Return Value

If the `failingBlock` you provide returns a value or throws an error, the function returns that value or rethrows the error.
