Creates an expectation that any KVO change to the specified key path of the observed object fulfills.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalystmacOSDeprecatedtvOSvisionOSDeprecatedwatchOSDeprecated

``` source
convenience init(
    keyPath: String,
    object: Any
)
```

## Parameters 

`keyPath`  

The key path to observe.

`object`  

The object to observe.

## Discussion

This initializer sets up KVO observation for `keyPath` with the following NSKeyValueObservingOptions:

- new

- old

The inclusion of the new and old options means that any custom KVO handler you provide in the expectationâ€™s handler property receives a change info dictionary that contains the newKey and oldKey keys.
