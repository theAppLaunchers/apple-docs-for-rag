Instance Method

# testCase(\_:didFailWithDescription:inFile:atLine:)

Notifies the observer when a test case reports a failure.

``` source
optional func testCase(
    _ testCase: XCTestCase,
    didFailWithDescription description: String,
    inFile filePath: String?,
    atLine lineNumber: Int
)
```

Deprecated

Use testCase(_:didRecord:) instead. If you implement both this method and testCase(_:didRecord:), the test will not call this method.

## Parameters 

`testCase`  

The test case that reported a failure. Additional information about the test case can be retrieved from the test caseâ€™s associated XCTestRun.

`description`  

A textual description of the failure.

`filePath`  

The path to the file in the failure occurred, or `nil` if the file path is unknown.

The line number on which the failure was reported.
