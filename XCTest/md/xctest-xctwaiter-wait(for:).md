Type Method

# wait(for:)

Creates a waiter that waits on a group of expectations.

``` source
class func wait(for expectations: [XCTestExpectation]) -> XCTWaiter.Result
```

## Parameters 

`expectations`  

An array of expectations the test must satisfy.

## Return Value

A value describing the outcome of waiting for `expectations`.

## Discussion

In Objective-C code, you might use an expectation to wait on a call to an interface that uses a completion handler to return a result. In Swift, consider calling `withCheckedContinuation(function:_:)` to use Concurrency instead of an expectation to wait on the result.
