# XCTExpectedFailure

An object that represents an expected test failure.

``` source
class XCTExpectedFailure
```

## Overview

The test system creates and tracks instances of `XCTExpectedFailure` when you call one of the `XCTExpectFailure` functions. Donâ€™t create or use them directly.

## Topics

### Detailing Expected Failure

var failureReason: String?

An optional string that describes why the test expects a failure.

var issue: XCTIssue

The issue that fulfills the expected failure.

### Setting Options

class Options

Options that determine how the test matches the expected failure to an actual test failure, and whether an unfulfilled expected failure results in a test failure.
