# tvOS 12.2 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## Overview

The tvOS 12.2 SDK provides support for developing tvOS apps for Apple TV devices running tvOS 12.2. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 10.2 available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 10.2, see Xcode Release Notes.

### App Store

#### Promoting Your Subscriptions with New Offers

StoreKit now supports subscription offers in addition to introductory offers, so apps with auto-renewable subscriptions can provide a discounted price for a specific duration for existing and previously subscribed customers. You can use subscription offers to help win back subscribers who have canceled their subscriptions or promote an upgrade to another subscription at a special price. Customers can accept the offer even if theyâ€™ve already completed an introductory offer.

StoreKit introduces a new array of SKProductDiscount objects within the SKProduct class to display offers within your app to eligible customers. Add a new SKPaymentDiscount object within the SKPayment class to allow these offers to be accepted by the customer.
