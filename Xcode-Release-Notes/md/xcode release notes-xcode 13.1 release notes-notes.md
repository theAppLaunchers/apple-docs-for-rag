# Xcode 13.1 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

Xcode 13.1 includes SDKs for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, watchOS 8, and macOS Monterey 12. The Xcode 13.1 release supports on-device debugging for iOS 9 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 13.1 requires a Mac running macOS 11.3 or later.

### Debugging

#### Known Issues

- Console, Xcode, `lldb`, and debugging tools can’t symbolicate crash logs that macOS transfers from connected devices running iOS 15, watchOS 8, or tvOS 15. (78124467, 83760462, 84048036, 84048399) (FB9669482)

  **Workaround**: Use Xcode’s Devices & Simulators window \> View Device Logs to import log files from connected devices, and transform them into a human-readable form. You can also access crash logs directly on iOS devices using the Settings app under Privacy \> Analytics \> Analytics Data and use the share sheet to transfer them to a Mac without any loss of information. Open the resulting log files using Console, or by dragging and dropping them onto Xcode in the Dock.

### Interface Builder

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed rendering issues that affected UITableView for some iOS storyboards. (82731572, 83465487)

- Fixed an issue where iPhone 13 mini wouldn’t rotate to landscape orientation. (83465491)

### Source Control

#### Known Issues

- Adding commits to a pull request in Xcode may not update the Changes navigator until you re-launch Xcode. (70398244)

  **Workaround**: Re-launch Xcode.

- The Recent Branches section may continue to display an Upstream Arrow on a branch after you push changes on that branch. (80597226)

  **Workaround**: Restart Xcode to update the status.

- Xcode may not correctly format code in pull request comments. (82143328)

- Xcode may forget or reject credentials for GitLab Self-Hosted accounts. (82501314)

- Repositories Navigator may sometimes display the current branch indicator on multiple branches. (82629835)

  **Workaround**: Re-launch Xcode or wait for the status of these files to update.

- In Flat view mode, the Commit sheet may sometimes present without selecting a file. (83417116)

### SwiftUI

#### Known Issues

- In Previews and in simulated iOS 15 devices, Button elements support the iPad cursor hover states by default, but in iOS 15.1 BorderedButtonStyle no longer has a default hover effect. Use the HoverEffect modifier on the `Button` to add a default hover effect when running in iOS 15.1. (83516916)
