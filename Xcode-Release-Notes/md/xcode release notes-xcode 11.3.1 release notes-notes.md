# Xcode 11.3.1 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes

## Overview

Xcode 11.3.1 supports developing apps for iOS 13.3, iPadOS 13.3, tvOS 13.3, watchOS 6.1, and macOS Catalina 10.15.2. Xcode 11.3.1 supports on-device debugging for iOS 8 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 11.3.1 requires a Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later.

### General

#### Known Issues

- When you create an Objective-C category file by choosing File \> New \> File, the newly created file includes an import of the AppKit framework. This causes a compilation error for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. (55977950) (FB7346800)

  **Workaround:** Remove the import of AppKit from the source file.

### Debugging

#### Resolved Issues

- Inspection of global variables in Swift and Objective-C works properly in `lldb`. (57884467)

### Interface Builder

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed a crash that could occur when using an attributed string in a UILabel. (55737956, 57990674)

- Fixed a crash that could occur after dragging a toolbar item out of the Allowed set in the canvas. (18133890, 57982132)

### Simulator

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue that would cause Xcode to time out waiting for Simulator.app to become ready, when multiple copies of Xcode are installed. (57050823, 57676897)

- Resolved an issue that prevented Xcode from launching processes with Thread Sanitizer enabled on macOS Catalina 10.15.2. (57822138)

### Source Editor

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed a crash that could occur when typing a doc comment after invoking undo. (56522994, 57762965)

### Swift

#### Resolved Issues

- Reduced the size of dependency files (`.d`) produced by the Swift compiler, which can improve incremental build times and disk usage for targets with many source files. (57361722, 57865813)
