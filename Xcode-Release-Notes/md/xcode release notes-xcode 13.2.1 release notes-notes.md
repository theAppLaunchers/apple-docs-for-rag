# Xcode 13.2.1 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

Xcode 13.2.1 includes SDKs for iOS 15.2, iPadOS 15.2, tvOS 15.2, watchOS 8.3, and macOS Monterey 12.1. The Xcode 13.2.1 release supports on-device debugging for iOS 9 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 13.2.1 requires a Mac running macOS 11.3 Big Sur or later.

### General

#### Resolved Issues

- Resolved an issue where the Mac App Store version of Xcode failed during package resolution with the error `Internal error: missingPackageDescriptionModule` when using Swift packages either standalone or as dependencies in an Xcode project or workspace. (86435800) (FB9807887)

#### Known Issues

- Xcode contains a copy of the log4j library that has the CVE-2021-44228 security vulnerability. Xcode automatically downloads an updated version of this library and installs it into `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.amp.itmstransporter`. When submitting apps to the App Store, Xcode uses the updated version of the library. (86390060)

### Apple Clang Compiler

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue where apps built with Xcode 13 or Xcode 13.1 sometimes crashed at launch with an error reporting that the `libswift_Concurrency.dylib` library was not loaded. This only affected apps that used Swift Concurrency features (such as `async`/`await`), deployed to iOS prior to 15, tvOS prior to 15, or watchOS prior to 8, and had bitcode enabled. (86349088)
