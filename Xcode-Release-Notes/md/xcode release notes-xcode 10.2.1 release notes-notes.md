# Xcode 10.2.1 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## Overview

Xcode 10.2.1 includes SDKs for iOS 12.2, watchOS 5.2, macOS 10.14.4, and tvOS 12.2. Xcode 10.2.1 supports on-device debugging for iOS 8 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 10.2.1 requires a Mac running macOS 10.14.3 or later.

### Apple Clang Compiler

#### Resolved Issues

- Simulator builds of watchOS projects that emit bitcode no longer fail with the error message: “GNU-style inline assembly is disabled.” (48903352)

### Build System

#### Resolved Issues

- Resolved an issue that would produce a spurious “ignoring build task” warning when building localized Siri Intents. (49649474)

### LLDB

#### Resolved Issues

- When importing Swift modules, LLDB now applies the `target.source-map` and the `DBGSourcePathRemapping` dictionary in the `.dSYM` bundle to the `-fmodule-map-file` option. This impacted alternative build systems that rely on path-remapping to access debug information. (49539481)

### Localization

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed a crash that could occur when modernizing localized content. (49575302)

### Simulator

#### Known Issues

- Simulators for iOS 9.3 and earlier might fail to launch Swift apps with the message: “dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libauto.dylib”. (49326587)

  **Workaround:** Run the following command in Terminal for the relevant version of iOS:

  ```
  sudo mkdir '/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS 9.3.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/usr/lib/swift'
  ```

### Swift Compiler

#### Known Issues

- In some cases, compilation may fail without emitting a specific error. (49303574)

  **Workaround:** Disable batch mode by adding the `SWIFT_ENABLE_BATCH_MODE` custom build setting and setting it to `NO`. If you’re invoking `swift` directly, include `-disable-batch-mode` on the command line.

- If you set the Reflection Metadata Level build setting to `None`, you might get a linker error about a missing nominal type descriptor when building a Swift project. (49710077)

  **Workaround:** Change the setting to `All`.

- Using an `@objc` designated initializer as a protocol witness always creates an instance of the base class, even if the protocol requirement is called on the metatype of a subclass. (49560721)

  For example, the following code should create an instance of `DerivedClass`, but actually creates an instance of `BaseClass`:

  ```
  protocol Initable {
      init()
  }

  class BaseClass: NSObject, Initable {
      required override init() {
          super.init()
      }
  }

  class DerivedClass: BaseClass {}

  let type: Initable.Type = DerivedClass.self
  print(type.init())
  ```

  **Workaround:** Either declare the initializer as `@nonobjc`, or replace the protocol’s initializer requirement with a static method, as follows:

  ```
  protocol Initable {
      static func construct() -> Self
  }

  class BaseClass: NSObject, Initable {
      required override init() {
          super.init()
      }

      static func construct() -> Self {
          return self.init()
      }
  }

  class DerivedClass: BaseClass {}
  ```

#### Resolved Issues

- A build time regression associated with Swift files that define a large number of types has been resolved. (49022293)

- The Swift compiler now applies the `-fdebug-prefix-map` to path names in Clang module import debug information records. (49539327)

- Indexing an invalid class that has circular inheritance during a debug build no longer hangs the compiler. (SR-10236, 49539370)

- Resolved a memory usage issue associated with whole module optimization mode. (49586719)

- Resolved a build-time crash that occurred when the Thread Sanitizer was enabled. (49539420)

- Checking validity of the conditional requirements associated with constrained type extensions, such as when using synthesized protocol conformance code, now completes correctly. (49539169)

- When you declare enumerations that contain a single case with an associated value and multiple cases without an associated value, the compiler now properly distinguishes the cases without associated values. (SR-10221, 49539226)

  ```
  enum SomeEnum {
      case payloadCase(defaultUnknownInnerValue: Int),
      nonPayloadCase1,
      nonPayloadCase2

      var isNonPayloadCase1: Bool {
          switch self {
          case .nonPayloadCase1:
              return true
          default:
              return false
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  The compiler now properly distinguishes between .`nonPayloadCase1` and `.nonPayloadCase2`.

### Swift Package Manager

#### Resolved Issues

- The `swift package generate-xcodeproj` command now handles submodules in the top-level package. (49535554)
