# Xcode 13.4 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

Xcode 13.4 includes SDKs for iOS 15.5, iPadOS 15.5, tvOS 15.4, watchOS 8.5, and macOS Monterey 12.3. The Xcode 13.4 release supports on-device debugging for iOS 15.5, iPadOS 15.5, tvOS 15.4, watchOS 8.5, and later. Xcode 13.4 requires a Mac running macOS Monterey 12 or later.

### Build System

#### Known Issues

- Swift Playgrounds app projects with package dependencies fail to build for Mac Catalyst when a package specifies `.iOS(...)` in its `platforms` array in the manifest, but doesn’t specify `.macCatalyst(...)`. (88726762)

  **Workaround**: Add `.macCatalyst(...)` to the `platforms` array with the same value as the `iOS(...)` entry.

### Devices

#### Known Issues

- Xcode 13.4 is unable to prepare devices running iOS 15.6 beta for development. (93452791)

  **Workaround**: Use Xcode 13.3.1.

### Localization

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue where Xcode was sometimes unable to build or close after failing to export localizations. (91161985)

### Reality Composer

#### Known Issues

- Using the Reality Composer app or previewing Reality Composer projects in Xcode may lead to a crash on Mac systems with AMD GPU: MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016), MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019), iMac Pro (2017). (92637801)

  **Workaround**: Use Xcode 13.3.

### Signing and Distribution

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue with generating symbols for Quick Look plug-ins during app distribution. (91361932)

### Source Control

#### Known Issues

- Users can’t onboard with an Apple ID that hasn’t been upgraded to use two-factor authentication. (92041517)

  **Workaround**: Upgrade your Apple ID to use two-factor authentication.

- The workflow editor doesn’t show test plans for schemes that have been recently converted to test plans. (92053036)

  **Workaround**: Convert to test plans, commit and push your changes to your remote repository before onboarding.

### Swift

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed a compiler issue that caused a runtime crash in `NativeSet` when back deploying to iOS 15.3 or earlier. (90666260)

- The async version of `addTeardownBlock` method in `XCTestCase` is now available. (90665371)

- Closures that are guaranteed to run on the main actor are now permitted to reference local variables from their enclosing scopes that are also running on the main actor.

  ```
  @MainActor
  class MyController: UIViewController {
    var isExcited: Bool = false

    func doSomething() {
      var title = "Hello"

      Task { @MainActor in
        if isExcited { // okay, accessing main actor-isolated stored property
          title += "!" // okay, accessing main actor-isolated local variable
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

\(90665432\)

### Swift Packages

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed a bug that prevented Swift Packages from finding a package plug-in tool if a target in a different package than the plug-in that requires it built the tool. (90650826)

### Testing

#### Known Issues

- Xcode crashes if you attempt to run unit or UI tests for watchOS apps when the Run scheme action’s executable is set to None. (74928871)

  **Workaround**: Set the Run scheme action’s executable to a valid WatchKit app target built by the scheme.
