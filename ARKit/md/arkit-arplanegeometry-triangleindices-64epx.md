Instance Property

# triangleIndices

An array of indices describing the triangle mesh formed by the plane geometryâ€™s vertex data.

iOS 11.3+iPadOS 11.3+

``` source
@nonobjc
var triangleIndices: [Int16] { get }
```

## Discussion

Each 16-bit integer value in this array represents an index into the vertices and textureCoordinates arrays. Each set of three indices identifies the vertices that form a single triangle in the mesh. You can use array as an index buffer for a triangle mesh in GPU-based rendering or to create 3D model asset files.

Each set of three indices forms a triangle, so the number of indices in the triangleIndices array is three times the triangleCount value.
