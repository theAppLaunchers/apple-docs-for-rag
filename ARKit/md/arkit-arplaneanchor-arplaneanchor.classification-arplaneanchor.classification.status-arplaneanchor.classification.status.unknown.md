## Discussion

ARKit attempts to classify detected planes using a finite set of common categories. However, a detected plane may not be a real object fitting any of those categories, or the plane classification process may not be able to recognize it. In such cases, the plane anchorâ€™s classification is ARPlaneAnchor.Classification.none(_:) with an associated value of ARPlaneAnchor.Classification.Status.unknown.
