    from point: CGPoint,
    allowing target: ARRaycastQuery.Target,
    alignment: ARRaycastQuery.TargetAlignment
) -> ARRaycastQuery?
```

## Discussion

When you call this function, ARKit creates a ray that extends in the positive z-direction from the argument screen space point, to determine if any of the argument targets exist in the physical environment anywhere along the ray. If so, ARKit returns a 3D position where the ray intersects the target.
