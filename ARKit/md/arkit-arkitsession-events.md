## Discussion

The following example detects changes in the current sessionâ€™s authorization status.

```
let session = ARKitSession()
Task {
    for await update in session.events {
        if case .authorizationChanged(let type, let status) = update {
            print("Authorization. Status of \(type) changed to \(status).")
        } else {
            print("Another session event \(update).")
        }
    }
}
```
