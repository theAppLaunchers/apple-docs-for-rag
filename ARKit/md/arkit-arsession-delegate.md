## Discussion

If you use the ARSCNView or ARSKView class to display your AR experience, a session delegate isnâ€™t necessary. Those views automatically display captured video images and coordinate SceneKit or SpriteKit content to track device and camera motion.

If you create your own visualization for an AR experience using Metal or other rendering technologies, set a session delegate. Your delegate object periodically receives ARFrame objects captured by the session. These objects contain video frame images for you to display and AR scene information you can use to coordinate display of the scene elements you render.
