# environmentTexturing

An option that determines how the framework generates environment textures.

``` source
var environmentTexturing: ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.EnvironmentTexturing { get set }
```

## Discussion

Environment textures are cube-map textures that depict the view in all directions from a specific point in a scene. In 3D asset rendering, environment textures are the basis for image-based lighting algorithms where surfaces can realistically reflect light from their surroundings. ARKit generates environment textures during an AR session using camera imagery, allowing SceneKit or a custom-rendering engine to provide realistic image-based lighting for virtual objects in your AR experience.

To enable texture map generation for your configuration, change this property (from its default value of ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.EnvironmentTexturing.none):

- With ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.EnvironmentTexturing.manual environment texturing, you identify points in the scene for which you want light probe texture maps by creating AREnvironmentProbeAnchor objects and adding them to the session.

- With ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.EnvironmentTexturing.automatic environment texturing, ARKit automatically creates, positions, and adds AREnvironmentProbeAnchor objects to the session.

In both cases, ARKit automatically generates environment textures as the session collects camera imagery. Use a delegate method such as session(_:didUpdate:) to find out when a texture is available, and access it from the anchorâ€™s environmentTexture property.

If you display AR content using ARSCNView and the automaticallyUpdatesLighting option, SceneKit automatically retrieves AREnvironmentProbeAnchor texture maps and uses them to light the scene.
