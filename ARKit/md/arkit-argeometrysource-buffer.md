var buffer: any MTLBuffer { get }

## Discussion

Each vector in the buffer is of the type defined by format. Every vector may itself contain multiple scalars, defined by componentsPerVector.

The bufferâ€™s storageMode is MTLStorageMode.shared which allows it to be accessed on both, the CPU, and GPU.
