## Discussion

This value indicates that visual localization is complete and geo-tracking accuracy is low.

One technique an app can use to deal with low accuracy is to render location anchors with an asset thatâ€™s more forgiving, like a large ball. If an app renders the ball further in the air, any offset that results from low accuracy will be less noticeable, and less critical to the user.
