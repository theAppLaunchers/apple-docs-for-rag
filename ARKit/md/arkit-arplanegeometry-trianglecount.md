Instance Property

# triangleCount

The number of triangles described by the triangleIndices buffer.

iOS 11.3+iPadOS 11.3+Mac Catalyst 13.1+

``` source
var triangleCount: Int { get }
```

## Discussion

Each set of three indices forms a triangle, so the number of indices in the triangleIndices buffer is three times the triangleCount value.
