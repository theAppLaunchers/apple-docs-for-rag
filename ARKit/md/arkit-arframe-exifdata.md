## Discussion

The systemâ€™s image capture pipeline produces pixel data and auxiliary information for each exposure. The AR frame exposes this pixel data through capturedImage and the auxilliary info through this property (exifData). Example EXIF data includes camera manufacturer, orientation, compression, resolution, exposure, and the date and time that the exposure occurred.
