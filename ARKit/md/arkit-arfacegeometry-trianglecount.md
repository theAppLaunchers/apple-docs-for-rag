Instance Property

# triangleCount

The number of triangles described by the triangleIndices buffer.

iOS 11.0+iPadOS 11.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+

``` source
var triangleCount: Int { get }
```

## Discussion

Each set of three indices forms a triangle, so the number of indices in the triangleIndices buffer is three times the triangleCount value.

Face mesh topology is constant across ARFaceGeometry instances, so the value of this property is the same for all instances.
