Instance Method

# export(to:previewImage:)

Writes a binary representation of the object to the specified file URL.

iOS 12.0+iPadOS 12.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+

``` source
func export(
    to url: URL,
    previewImage: UIImage?
) throws
```

## Parameters 

`url`  

The file URL at which to write the reference object data.

`previewImage`  

A thumbnail image to be embedded in the reference objectâ€™s filesystem representation.

ARKit ignores preview images when loading reference objects. Instead, this image helps make reference object files visually identifiable in external tools like Xcode, Finder, and Quick Look.

## Discussion

After exporting a reference object from your object-scanning app to a file, you can bundle that reference object into other apps you create by inserting it into an Xcode asset catalog.
