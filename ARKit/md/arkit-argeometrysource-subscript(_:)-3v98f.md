## Discussion

This subscript operates on three-component geometry sources with a format of MTLVertexFormat.float3. This operator returns an (x, y, z) offset relative to its parent anchorâ€™s position that corresponds to the subscripted vertex position in vertices and to the subscripted normal vector in normals.
