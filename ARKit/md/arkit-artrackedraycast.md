## Overview

Tracked raycasting improves hit-testing techniques by repeating the query for a 3D position in succession. ARKit provides you with an updated position as it refines its understanding of world over time.

To start a tracked raycast, you call trackedRaycast(_:updateHandler:) on your appâ€™s current ARSession.
