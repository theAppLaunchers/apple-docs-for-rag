iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+

``` source
var maximumNumberOfTrackedFaces: Int { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value is one. Set the maximum number of tracked faces to limit the number of faces that can be tracked in a given frame. Check the value of supportedNumberOfTrackedFaces before setting this property.

No new anchors will be provided to your delegateâ€™s session(_:didAdd:) if more than the maximum number of faces are visible in the camera feed. In that case, ARKit continues to track the faces that already have associated face anchors.
