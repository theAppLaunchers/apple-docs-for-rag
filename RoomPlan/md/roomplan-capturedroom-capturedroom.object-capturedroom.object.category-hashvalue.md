``` source
var hashValue: Int { get }
```

## Discussion

Hash values are not guaranteed to be equal across different executions of your program. Do not save hash values to use during a future execution.

Important

`hashValue` is deprecated as a `Hashable` requirement. To conform to `Hashable`, implement the `hash(into:)` requirement instead. The compiler provides an implementation for `hashValue` for you.
