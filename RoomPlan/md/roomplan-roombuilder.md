# RoomBuilder

An object that generates a 3D asset from room-capture data.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+visionOS 16.0â€“1.0Deprecated

``` source
class RoomBuilder
```

## Overview

This class processes data from an earlier scan to generate a detailed CapturedRoom object.

Your app receives raw captured room data (CapturedRoomData) through:

- The view delegate (RoomCaptureViewDelegate) callback captureView(shouldPresent:error:) for an app that provides room-scanning features through the framework-provided view (RoomCaptureView).

- The scan session (RoomCaptureSession) callback captureSession(_:didEndWith:error:) for an app that provides room-scanning features by displaying its own view.

Your app generates a detailed captured room object by calling capturedRoom(from:) on the raw data. Your app can then inspect or modify this data before exporting the scanned room to a USDZ file.
