``` source
struct Section
```

## Overview

When RoomPlan recognizes a captured room as one of the common kinds of room areas, such as a living room, the framework adds an instance of this structure to the roomâ€™s sections array.

The section instance provides:

- A label type for the common area (label), such as CapturedRoom.Section.Label.livingRoom

- A center point (center), that generally locates the area within the room

- A story (story), that identifies a floor number for the area in the building

In a larger room, the framework may identify multiple types of areas, for example, a kitchen and a dining room. In that case, the `sections` array contains both, CapturedRoom.Section.Label.kitchen and CapturedRoom.Section.Label.diningRoom, and their `center` points distinguish their individual locations within the room.
