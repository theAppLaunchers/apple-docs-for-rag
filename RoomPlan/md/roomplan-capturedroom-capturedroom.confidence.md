Enumeration

# CapturedRoom.Confidence

Levels of certainty in the classification of a particular detail in a scan.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+

``` source
enum Confidence
```

## Overview

The framework chooses a level of certainty in its assessment of particular room features, such as:

- The confidence in a category that the captured room assigns its surfaces, such as doors, openings, walls, windows.

- The confidence in a category that the captured room assigns its objects.

## Topics

### Creating a confidence value

init(from: any Decoder) throws

Creates a confidence value by deserializing the specified decoder.

### Assessing a confidence value

case high

A confidence value that represents a high level of certainty.

case medium

A confidence value that represents a medium level of certainty.

case low

A confidence value that represents a low level of certainty.

### Comparing confidence values

static func == (CapturedRoom.Confidence, CapturedRoom.Confidence) -> Bool

Determines whether two confidence values are equal.

static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool

Determines whether two confidence values arenâ€™t equal.

func hash(into: inout Hasher)

Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.

var hashValue: Int

The hash value.

### Serializing a confidence value

func encode(to: any Encoder) throws

Serializes a confidence value to the specified encoder.
