# Captured Object Attributes

Determine details about the objects and surfaces that the framework identifies in a scan.

## Overview

Each CapturedRoom.Object contains attributes that the framework observes during a scan that convey details about the object. For example, an object of category CapturedRoom.Object.Category.chair may contain the attributes ChairType.stool and ChairLegType.star, which describes the frameworkâ€™s observations of the chair during the scan. An object exposes these details through its attributes array.

By reading the attribute information the framework sets on objects, your app can provide more informed utility with a scanned room, such as:

- A filtered list of product selections in a furniture catalog that matches just the categories and attributes of the present objects in the room.

- A more accurate visual representation, for example when rendering a virtual reality experience, by substituting the default object bounding boxes with detailed 3D models that your app chooses.

Tip

If you export a scan result to USDZ, for example, with export(to:metadataURL:modelProvider:exportOptions:), objects output as bounding boxes. To substitute the boxes with detailed 3D models based on object attributes, see CapturedRoom.ModelProvider.
