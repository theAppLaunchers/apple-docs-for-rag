Instance Method

# capturedStructure(from:)

Combines the argument captured rooms into a single unit.

iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+visionOS 16.0â€“1.0Deprecated

``` source
func capturedStructure(from rooms: [CapturedRoom]) async throws -> CapturedStructure
```

## Parameters 

`rooms`  

An array of captured room objects the app generates by performing multiple room-capture sessions in the same physical vicinity.

## Return Value

An object that consists of all of the captured room data across one or more scan sessions.

## Mentioned in 

Scanning the rooms of a single structure

## Discussion

Each captured room in the argument array represents the post-processed result of a single scan session. This function succeeds when all of the captured rooms share compatible world space; otherwise, the function fails with an error. CapturedRoom instances share compatible world space if they reside in the same physical vicinity (they connect to form a larger structure), such as different rooms in the same building.

There are two ways to ensure the captured rooms share compatible world space. You continue a single AR session by:

- Passing the same ARSession instance to the RoomCaptureSession objects that each produce a captured room. Be sure to pause the `ARSession` by calling stop(pauseARSession:) with an argument of `false` before handing it to a subsequent room-capture session.

- Loading a previously saved ARWorldMap to create an `ARSession` in compatible world space with previous scans.

Note

After loading a previously saved `ARWorldMap`, wait for ARCamera.TrackingState to change from `relocalizing` to `normal`. For this change to take effect, the system needs to observe through the camera some portion of the recently scanned area. To guide the user accordingly, you can present a UI that instructs the user to return to the previous room before beginning the next room-capture session.
