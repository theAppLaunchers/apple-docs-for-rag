## Mentioned in 

Scanning the rooms of a single structure

## Overview

This class in conjunction with CapturedStructure enables an app to export a 3D model that consists of multiple CapturedRoom instances. First, combine the rooms into a single captured result by calling capturedStructure(from:). Then, generate a 3D model of the whole structure by calling export(to:metadataURL:modelProvider:exportOptions:).
