Instance Method

# write(toAbsoluteOffset:\_:retryOnInterrupt:)

Writes the contents of a buffer at the specified offset.

``` source
func write(
    toAbsoluteOffset offset: Int64,
    _ buffer: UnsafeRawBufferPointer,
    retryOnInterrupt: Bool = true
) throws -> Int
```

## Parameters 

`offset`  

The file offset where writing begins.

`buffer`  

The region of memory that contains the data being written.

`retryOnInterrupt`  

Whether to retry the write operation if it throws interrupted. The default is `true`. Pass `false` to try only once and throw an error upon interruption.

## Return Value

The number of bytes that were written.

## Mentioned in 

Adopting Swift File Operations

## Discussion

Unlike write(_:retryOnInterrupt:), this method leaves the fileâ€™s existing offset unchanged.

The corresponding C function is `pwrite`.
