## Discussion

This initializer traps if `name` is `MACH_PORT_NULL`, or if `name` is `MACH_PORT_DEAD` and the `RightType` is `Mach.ReceiveRight`.

If the type of the right does not match the `RightType` of the `Mach.Port` being constructed, behavior is undefined.

The underlying port right will be automatically deallocated at the end of the `Mach.Port` instanceâ€™s lifetime.

This initializer makes a syscall to guard the right.
