``` source
func subtracting(_ other: Self) -> Self
```

## Parameters 

`other`  

A set of the same type as the current set.

## Return Value

A new set.

## Discussion

In the following example, the `nonNeighbors` set is made up of the elements of the `employees` set that are not elements of `neighbors`:

```
let employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Chris", "Diana", "Eric"]
let neighbors: Set = ["Bethany", "Eric", "Forlani", "Greta"]
let nonNeighbors = employees.subtracting(neighbors)
print(nonNeighbors)
// Prints "["Diana", "Chris", "Alicia"]"
```
