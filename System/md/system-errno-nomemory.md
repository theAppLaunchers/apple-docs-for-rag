## Discussion

The new process image required more memory than was allowed by the hardware or by system-imposed memory management constraints. A lack of swap space is normally temporary; however, a lack of core is not. You can increase soft limits up to their corresponding hard limits.

The corresponding C error is `ENOMEM`.
