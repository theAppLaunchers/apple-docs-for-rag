## Discussion

On Unix platforms, absolute paths begin with a `/`. `isAbsolute` is equivalent to `root != nil`.

On Windows, absolute paths are fully qualified paths. `isAbsolute` is *not* equivalent to `root != nil` for traditional DOS paths (e.g. `C:foo` and `\bar` have roots but are not absolute). UNC paths and device paths are always absolute. Traditional DOS paths are absolute only if they begin with a volume or drive followed by a `:` and a separator.

NOTE: This does not perform shell expansion or substitute environment variables; paths beginning with `~` are considered relative.

Examples:

- Unix:

  - `/usr/local/bin`

  - `/tmp/foo.txt`

  - `/`

- Windows:

  - `C:\Users\`

  - `\\?\UNC\server\share\bar.exe`

  - `\\server\share\bar.exe`
