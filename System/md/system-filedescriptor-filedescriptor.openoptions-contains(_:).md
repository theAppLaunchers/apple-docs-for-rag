``` source
func contains(_ member: Self) -> Bool
```

Available when `Self` is `Self.Element`.

## Parameters 

`member`

## Return Value

`true` if the option set contains `member`; otherwise, `false`.

## Discussion

This example uses the `contains(_:)` method to check whether next-day shipping is in the `availableOptions` instance.
