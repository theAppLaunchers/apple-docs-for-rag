``` source
func withPlatformString(_ body: (UnsafePointer) throws -> Result) rethrows -> Result
```

## Parameters 

`body`  

A closure with a pointer parameter that points to a null-terminated platform string. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for this method.

## Return Value

The return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.

## Discussion

If this is not the last component of a path, an allocation will occur in order to add the null terminator.

The pointer passed as an argument to `body` is valid only during the execution of this method. Don’t try to store the pointer for later use.
