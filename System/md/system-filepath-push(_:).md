mutating func push(_ other: FilePath)

## Discussion

This operation mimics traversing a directory structure (similar to the `cd` command), where pushing a relative path will append its components and pushing an absolute path will first clear `self`â€™s existing components.

Example:

```
var path: FilePath = "/tmp"
path.push("dir/file.txt") // path is "/tmp/dir/file.txt"
path.push("/bin")         // path is "/bin"
```
