``` source
func intersection(_ other: Self) -> Self
```

## Parameters 

`other`  

An option set.

## Return Value

A new option set with only the elements contained in both this set and `other`.

## Discussion

This example uses the `intersection(_:)` method to limit the available shipping options to what can be used with a PO Box destination.

```
// Can only ship standard or priority to PO Boxes
let poboxShipping: ShippingOptions = [.standard, .priority]
let memberShipping: ShippingOptions =
        [.standard, .priority, .secondDay]

let availableOptions = memberShipping.intersection(poboxShipping)
print(availableOptions.contains(.priority))
// Prints "true"
print(availableOptions.contains(.secondDay))
// Prints "false"
```
