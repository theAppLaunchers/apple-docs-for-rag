Instance Method

# lexicallyResolving(\_:)

Create a new `FilePath` by resolving `subpath` relative to `self`, ensuring that the result is lexically contained within `self`.

```

## Discussion

`subpath` will be lexically normalized (see `lexicallyNormalize`) as part of resolution, meaning any contained `.` and `..` components will be collapsed without resolving symlinks. Any root in `subpath` will be ignored.

Returns `nil` if the result would “escape” from `self` through use of the special directory component `..`.

This is useful for protecting against arbitrary path traversal from an untrusted subpath: the result is guaranteed to be lexically contained within `self`. Since this operation does not consult the file system to resolve symlinks, any escaping symlinks nested inside of `self` can still be targeted by the result.

Example:

```
let staticContent: FilePath = "/var/www/my-website/static"
let links: [FilePath] =
  ["index.html", "/assets/main.css", "../../../../etc/passwd"]
links.map { staticContent.lexicallyResolving($0) }
  // ["/var/www/my-website/static/index.html",
  //  "/var/www/my-website/static/assets/main.css",
  //  nil]
```
