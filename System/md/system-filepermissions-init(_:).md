``` source
init(_ sequence: S) where S : Sequence, Self.Element == S.Element
```

## Parameters 

`sequence`  

The elements to use as members of the new set.

## Discussion

Use this initializer to create a new set from an existing sequence, like an array or a range:

```
let validIndices = Set(0..

### Performing Set Operations

init()

Creates an empty option set.

init(arrayLiteral: Self.Element...)

Creates a set containing the elements of the given array literal.

func contains(Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether a given element is a member of the option set.

func formIntersection(Self)

Removes all elements of this option set that are not also present in the given set.

func formIntersection(Self)

Removes all elements of this option set that are not also present in the given set.

func formSymmetricDifference(Self)

Replaces this set with a new set containing all elements contained in either this set or the given set, but not in both.

func formUnion(Self)

Inserts the elements of another set into this option set.

func insert(Self.Element) -> (inserted: Bool, memberAfterInsert: Self.Element)

Adds the given element to the option set if it is not already a member.

func intersection(Self) -> Self

Returns a new option set with only the elements contained in both this set and the given set.

func isDisjoint(with: Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the set has no members in common with the given set.

var isEmpty: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the set has no elements.

func isStrictSubset(of: Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether this set is a strict subset of the given set.

func isStrictSuperset(of: Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether this set is a strict superset of the given set.

func isSubset(of: Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the set is a subset of another set.

func isSuperset(of: Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the set is a superset of the given set.
