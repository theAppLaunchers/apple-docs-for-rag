Instance Property

# previewItem

The item to preview.

macOS 10.6+

``` source
@MainActor
var previewItem: (any QLPreviewItem)! { get set }
```

## Discussion

Quick Look requires Items you wish to conform to the QLPreviewItem protocol. When you set this property, the QLPreviewView loads the preview asynchronously. Due to this asynchronous behavior, donâ€™t assume that the preview is ready immediately after assigning it to this property.
