# close()

Closes the preview session.

``` source
func close() async throws
```

## Discussion

If the existing session is still open, this method closes it. The sessionâ€™s events stream receives a `.didClose` event upon success.

Throws

An `Error` if it is not possible to close the PreviewSession.
