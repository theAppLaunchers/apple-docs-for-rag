The Quick Look generator produces the thumbnail as an icon with decor.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
let kQLThumbnailOptionIconModeKey: CFString!
```

## Discussion

The default value is kCFBooleanFalse. If you use the default, the Quick Look feature creates a thumbnail image with no icon decor. To create the thumbnail as an icon, set the value to kCFBooleanTrue. The iconâ€™s image includes all the typical icon decor, such as shadows and a curled corner.
