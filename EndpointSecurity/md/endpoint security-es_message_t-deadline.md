Instance Property

# deadline

The deadline by which your app must respond to the event.

Mac CatalystmacOS

``` source
var deadline: UInt64
```

## Discussion

If you fail to respond to an event before this deadline, Endpoint Security may terminate the client process, or restart the process if itâ€™s a system extension. If your client repeatedly misses deadlines, Endpoint Security may refuse new connections from es_new_client(_:_:) altogether.
