## Discussion

Authorization events require the client to respond with an appropriate result using either es_respond_auth_result(_:_:_:_:) or es_respond_flags_result(_:_:_:_:). This error occurs if the client attempts to respond to an authorization event using the wrong interface. It also occurs when the client performs any response to a notification-only event.
