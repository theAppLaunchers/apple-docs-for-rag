# App Store Connect API 2.0 release notes

Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.

## Overview

App Store Connect API version 2.0 provides resources that enable you to automate actions you take in App Store Connect.

### New features

- Added support for creating, managing, and submitting for review your in-app purchases and auto-renewable subscriptions, using the resources now available in the In-App Purchase and Auto-Renewable Subscriptions collections. The Promoted Purchases resources can now manage promoted in-app purchases and auto-renewable subscriptions, including their visibility and images. The resources in the In-App Purchase and Subscription App Store Review Submissions collection manage submissions for review.

- The Customer Reviews and Customer Review Responses resources support retrieving customer reviews for your app that appear on the App Store, and managing your responses to the customer reviews.

- Power and Performance Metrics and Logs adds a new `HANGS` diagnostic type filter for List All Diagnostic Signatures for a Build, updates the schema for responses in xcodeMetrics, and adds support for long-lived tokens as described in Generating Tokens for API Requests.

### Deprecations

- The List All In-App Purchases for an App V1 endpoint is now deprecated and replaced with the List All In-App Purchases for an App endpoint.

### Removals

- App Store Connect APIs for declaring IDFA usage are now removed. In your app, APIs that offer IDFA functionality are still available but require obtaining the user’s permission using App Tracking Transparency. You may also need to provide information about IDFA usage in your app’s privacy details on the App Store. For more information, see User Privacy and Data Use and App Privacy Details.
