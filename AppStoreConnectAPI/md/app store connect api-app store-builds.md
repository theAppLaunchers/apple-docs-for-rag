# Builds

Manage builds for testers and submit builds for review.

## Overview

A `builds` resource represents a single build of an app. You must upload builds using Xcode or Transporter. Once App Store Connect processes the build, it will appear as a build resource.

Once the build is in the system, you can use the API to perform actions like:

- Submitting builds for review.

- Individually assigning builds to testers.

- Adding the build to a beta group for testing.
