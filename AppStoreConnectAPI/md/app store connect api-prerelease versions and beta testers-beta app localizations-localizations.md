# Beta App Localizations

Beta test information about apps, specific to a locale.

## Overview

A `betaAppLocalization` resource represents one localized set of information about an app that is visible to beta testers. When distributing a prerelease app, the TestFlight app on the beta testerâ€™s device displays information such as descriptions, URLs, and privacy policies. The information can be localized for the languages listed in App Store localizations.
