# Getting geographic distance

Return the relative geographic distance between two match requests.

## Overview

Use the `geoLatency()` function in the expression of a matchmaking rule to get the geographic distance between two devices that submit match requests. This function uses the location of the playersâ€™ devices that the match request contains, but keeps that information private.

### Declaration

```
number geoLatency(object $request1, object $request2)
```

### Parameters

`request1`  
A match request to compare with `request2`.

`request2`  
A match request to compare with `request1`.

### Return value

A value between `0.0` and `1.0` that represents the relative geographic distance between the player devices that issued these requests, where `0.0` is in the same local area and `1.0` is the longest possible distance.
