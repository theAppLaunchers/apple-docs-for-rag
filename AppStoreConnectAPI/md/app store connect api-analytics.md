## Overview

Use the Analytics Reports API to analyze your appâ€™s performance on iOS and the App Store and find opportunities for improvement. To learn more about interpreting the data using the glossary of report fields and definitions, see Analytics Reports.

To help protect user privacy, where appropriate, Apple is applying measures to protect personally identifable infomation. For specific reports, Apple adds noise or applies crowd anonymity, and uses both approaches for other reports. Apple only reports totals when a specific number of data points are available. For more infomation about these measures, see Protecting user privacy in report data.
