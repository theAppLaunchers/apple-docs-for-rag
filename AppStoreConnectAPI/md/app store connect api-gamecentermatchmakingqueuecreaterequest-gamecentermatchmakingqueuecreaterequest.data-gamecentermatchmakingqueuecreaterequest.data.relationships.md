# GameCenterMatchmakingQueueCreateRequest.Data.Relationships

The rule sets that you include when creating a queue.

App Store Connect API 3.1+

``` source
object GameCenterMatchmakingQueueCreateRequest.Data.Relationships
```

## Properties

`experimentRuleSet`

GameCenterMatchmakingQueueCreateRequest.Data.Relationships.ExperimentRuleSet

The experimental rule set to test the associated rules with live match requests.

If you provide an experimental rule set, Game Center processes the match requests in the queue using both the experimental and the required rule set, except that it doesnâ€™t return the results of the experimental rule set to clients.

Then compare the results of the experimental rule set with the production rule set using metrics, such as the List all queues and Read queue information endpoints.
