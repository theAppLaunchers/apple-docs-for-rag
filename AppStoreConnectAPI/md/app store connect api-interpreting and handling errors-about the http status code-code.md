# About the HTTP Status Code

Learn how the status code helps you determine if an App Store Connect API request succeeded or why it failed.

## Overview

The codes the API returns are defined by the HTTP standard and fall in these meaningful ranges:

- 200s: The request succeeded.

- 400s: The request failed due to an error in the request.

- 500s: The request failed due to a server-side error.

The following table lists the HTTP status codes and the reasons why App Store Connect API may return them.

| HTTP Status Code | Name | Description |
|----|----|----|
| 200 | OK | The request was successful and response data was returned. |
| 201 | Created | The request to create a resource was successful and response data was returned. The location header contains the created resourceâ€™s URI. |
| 204 | No Content | The request was successful and no response data is needed. |
| 400 | Bad Request | The request is invalid and cannot be accepted. |
| 403 | Forbidden | The request is not allowed. This can happen if your API key is revoked, your token is incorrectly formatted, or if the requested operation is not allowed. |
| 404 | Not Found | The request cannot be fulfilled because the resource does not exist. |
| 405 | Method Not Allowed | The request cannot be accepted because the HTTP method is not appropriate for the given URI. |
| 406 | Not Acceptable | The request cannot be accepted because the `Accept` header requires a media type the API does not support.  The response in this case is in plain text, not JSON. |
| 409 | Conflict | The request cannot be accepted because the JSON data you have provided conflicts with rules enforced by the API. |
| 410 | Gone | The request cannot be fulfilled because the requested resource, which is known to have previously existed, no longer exists. Usually this case results in a 404 status code, but when knowledge that a resource previously existed is important, the API returns a 410. This happens, for instance, if you request a user invitation after the user accepted the invitation. |
| 415 | Unsupported Media Type | The request cannot be accepted because the media type of the request entity is not a format the API understands. Make sure the `Content-Type` header in the request is `application/json`. |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | The request cannot be accepted because the data you provided is not valid JSON or is not expected for the request. |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | The request cannot be accepted because you have exceeded the rate limit for your API key. You will need to wait awhile and try the request again. |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | The request failed. This may be due to a temporary outage. Check the Apple Developer System Status Page for up to date information on the App Store Connect API. |

If the request fails, use the additional data provided in the ErrorResponse to determine how to respond to the error.
