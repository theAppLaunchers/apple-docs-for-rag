# Game Center leaderboard sets

Manage Game Center leaderboard sets for your apps.

## Overview

Leaderboard sets organize several leaderboards into a single unit. For example, in a game that includes many levels, you might define a leaderboard set to organize the leaderboards for each level. A single app can have 100 leaderboard sets, and a set can have a maximum of 100 leaderboards. You must have at least one leaderboard for your app before you can create a leaderboard set. Once you add leaderboard sets to your app, all future leaderboards that you configure for the app must be included in a leaderboard set.

The process to start using leaderboard sets to organize your appâ€™s leaderboards includes these steps:

- Create the first leaderboard set.

- Create additional leaderboard sets.

- Add new leaderboards directly into leaderboard sets.

For more information about how to use Leaderboard sets in your app, see Configure leaderboards sets.
