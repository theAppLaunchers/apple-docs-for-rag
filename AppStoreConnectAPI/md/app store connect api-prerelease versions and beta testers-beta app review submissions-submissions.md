# Beta App Review Submissions

The submissions of builds for beta app review, including the status of submissions.

## Overview

A `betaAppReviewSubmissions` resource represents Appleâ€™s review of a build before its distribution through TestFlight. Create a beta app review submission when you are ready to submit a build. App Store Connect validates the beta app review submission to ensure it includes necessary information such as `appEncryptionDeclarations`, `betaAppReviewDetails`, and so on, and submits the build to the review team.

API users can get the `betaAppReviewSubmissions` to see if the build has been accepted or rejected.
