App Store Connect API 1.5+

``` source

```

## Properties

`isPrefix`

`boolean`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the pattern matches the start of a branch name, or the exact branch name.

`pattern`

`string`

A case-sensitive string. If the string is a prefix pattern, Xcode Cloud starts a build when the changed branch name starts with this string. Otherwise, Xcode Cloud starts a build when the changed branch name exactly matches this string.
