# Prerelease Versions and Beta Testers

Manage your beta testing program, including beta testers and groups, apps, App Clips, and builds.

## Overview

TestFlight allows you to distribute your apps to beta testers before releasing your apps on the App Store. You can learn more about TestFlight on the Apple Developer website.

Using the App Store Connect API, you can automate the same tasks you perform in the TestFlight section of App Store Connect; for example:

- Inviting testers to your app

- Managing your builds, groups, and public links

- Creating App Clip experiences for testers

- Submitting your build for external beta testing
