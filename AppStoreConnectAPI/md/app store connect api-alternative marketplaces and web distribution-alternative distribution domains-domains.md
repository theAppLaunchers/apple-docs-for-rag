# Alternative Distribution Domains

Create and read alternative distribution domains.

## Overview

You use the endpoints and objects in this API collection to add your alternative distribution app’s base domain to App Store Connect. For more information on adding a domain for your alternative distribution app, see Add an alternative distribution domain.

All the individual pages for apps that your alternative marketplace app distributes need to be on this base domain and it also needs to house your sitemap to support marketplace search. For more information about your alternative marketplace’s sitemap, see Building a searchable catalog for your marketplace app for inclusion in Spotlight.

Your web distribution app needs to be served from this base domain.
