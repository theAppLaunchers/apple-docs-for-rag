# Getting value based on age using an array

Return a value that changes according to an array of values as a function of the age of the requests.

## Overview

Use the `agedValues()` function in the expression of a matchmaking rule to loosen matchmaking criteria over time. This function returns a value that changes based on the given arrays and depending on the age of requests. Use this function instead of `agedAsSteppedValue()` when you want more control over the values.

For example, pass the following parameters to this function:

```
agedValues(age, `5`, [ `20`, `30`, `40`, `50`, `60`, `100` ], 
                     [  `5`, `10`, `15`, `20`, `25`, `30` ])
```

If the `ageSeconds` parameter is `3` (less than the first item in the `ages` array), the value is `5`. If `ageSeconds` is `17`, the value is `40`. If `ageSeconds` is `32` (greater than the last item in the `ages` array), the value is `100`.

| Age range   | Return value |
|-------------|--------------|
| `[0, 4]`    | `5`          |
| `[5, 9]`    | `20`         |
| `[10, 14]`  | `30`         |
| `[15, 19]`  | `40`         |
| `[20, 24]`  | `50`         |
| `[25, 29]`  | `60`         |
| `[30, 30+]` | `100`        |

To loosen constraints over time, use the results of this function in comparisons. For example, compare the sum of all the player counts to a value that decreases with the average age of candidate requests that the matchmaking algorithm selects.

```
agedValues(avg(requests[].secondsInQueue), 8, [ 6, 4, 2], [ 10, 15, 20 ]) 

### Declaration

```
number agedValues(number        $ageSeconds, 
                  number        $initialValue,
                  array[number] $values, 
                  array[number] $ages)
```

### Parameters

| `ageSeconds` | The average, maximum, or minimum age of match requests in the queue. |
|----|----|
| `initialValue` | The value for `ages` that are less than the first item in the `ages` array |
| `values` | The values to map the age ranges to. |
| `ages` | The age ranges to map to the values. |

### Return value

If `ageSeconds` is less than the first item in the `ages` array (`ages[0]`), `initialValue`. If `ageSeconds` is in the range between two items in the `ages` array (`ages[n]
