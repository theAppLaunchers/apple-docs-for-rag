# Build Bundles

Read metadata for app and App Clip binaries included in a build you upload to App Store Connect.

## Overview

A `buildBundles` resource represents metadata for binaries you upload to App Store Connect as a build. It provides detailed information like capabilities an app uses, supported CPU architectures, and more. For a full list of available attributes, see BuildBundle.Attributes.

When you upload a build that contains an App Clip, use the APIs provided by the `buildBundles` resource to read:

- Cache status information for domains you associated with your App Clip

- Debug status information for domains you associated with your App Clip

- App Clip invocations you configured for testers who use the TestFlight app to launch your App Clip

- File size information for a build bundle
