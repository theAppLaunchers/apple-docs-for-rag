# Git References

Read information about the canonical reference for a Git branch or tag.

## Overview

The `scmGitReferences` resource represents the canonical Git reference for the Git commit that Xcode Cloud used to perform a build. The resource includes the following information:

- The referenceâ€™s name and canonical name

- Whether the reference has been deleted

- The type of the reference

For example, if Xcode Cloud uses the `bug-fix` branch for a build, the canonical Git reference is `refs/heads/bug-fix` and the name is `bug-fix`. If Xcode Cloud starts a build for the `release-1.0` tag, the canonical name is `refs/tags/release-1.0` and the name is `release-1.0`.

Note

This resource supports JSON web tokens with a lifetime of up to six months. For more information, see Determine the Appropriate Token Lifetime.
