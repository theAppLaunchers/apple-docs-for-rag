Instance Method

# download(\_:didWriteBytes:totalBytesWritten:totalBytesExpectedToWrite:)

Informs the delegate about the progress of the specified asset download.

iOS 16.1+iPadOS 16.1+Mac Catalyst 16.1+macOS 13.0+tvOS 18.4+visionOS 2.4+

``` source
optional func download(
    _ download: BADownload,
    didWriteBytes bytesWritten: Int64,
    totalBytesWritten: Int64,
    totalBytesExpectedToWrite totalExpectedBytes: Int64
)
```

## Parameters 

`download`  

The associated asset download.

`bytesWritten`  

The number of bytes the system writes to disk for the asset download since the previous execution of this method.

`totalBytesWritten`  

The total number of bytes the system writes to disk for the asset download.

`totalExpectedBytes`  

The total size, in bytes, that the framework expects to receive for the asset download.

## Discussion

Because the framework may be processing several asset downloads at once, it may call this method frequently and for different downloads. Cache an asset downloadâ€™s uniqueIdentifier when you first schedule it, and then match the identifier against the same property on `download` so you can track the individual progress of all in-progress downloads.
