## Default Implementations

### BADownloaderExtension Implementations

func downloads(for: BAContentRequest, manifestURL: URL, extensionInfo: BAAppExtensionInfo) -> Set&lt;BADownload>

Invoked by the system when the extension should check for updated content. This method will be invoked by the system upon requested events defined in `BAContentRequest`. This method should return a set of all `BAURLDownload`â€™s that your extension would like to schedule. During the invocation of this method, `BADownloadManager` will prohibit the ability to schedule additional downloads until this method exits scope. Therefore, all downloads needing to be scheduled should be returned here. If a download fails, it can be rescheduled using `BADownloadManager` in any other method in this protocol.
