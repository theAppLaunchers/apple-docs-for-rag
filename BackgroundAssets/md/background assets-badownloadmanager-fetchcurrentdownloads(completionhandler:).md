## Discussion

Concurrency Note

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as this page explains, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
var currentDownloads: [BADownload] { get async throws }
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

The completion handler takes the following parameters:

- An array of scheduled and in-progress downloads.

- An error if a problems occurs, or `nil` if the method successfully fetches the current downloads.
