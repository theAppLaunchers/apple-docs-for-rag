## Parameters 

`download`

## Discussion

Concurrency Note

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as this page explains, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
optional func download(_ download: BADownload, didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge) async -> (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?)
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

The completion handler takes the following parameters:

- An URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition that indicates whether the system processes, cancels, or rejects the challenge.

- If the specified dispostion is URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition.useCredential, the URLCredential to use for authentication; otherwise, specify `nil`.

If you implement this method, make sure to call the completion handler promptly and with the necessary information. Otherwise, the server may deny the request and the associated asset download fails.

For more information about authentication challenges, see Handling an authentication challenge.
