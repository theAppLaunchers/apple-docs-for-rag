## Discussion

This property contains zero or more ProximityReaderDiscovery.Content structures, each of which corresponds to information on a supported topic. The content associated with each structure is specific to the country of the current device. The array can be empty if no content is available for the current country.

Use this list only when you need to display a topic that isnâ€™t available in ProximityReaderDiscovery.Topic. In all other cases, use the content(for:) method to fetch the topic.

Accessing this property fetches the ProximityReaderDiscovery.Content structures from the system. If the system is unable to fetch the needed information, it throws an error.
