## Discussion

Call this method when the payment card issuer requests a PIN for the current transaction. When you call this method, the system displays UI with instructions on what the person needs to do. This UI remains onscreen until the system reads the personâ€™s PIN, you cancel the operation, or an error occurs.

Important

The encrypted payment card data are only kept 55 seconds after previous read if the PIN was not requested by the card. After this delay, this method will return PaymentCardReaderSession.ReadError.pinEntryFailed

Throws

This method throws a PaymentCardReaderSession.ReadError if a person dismisses the sheet or the sheet fails to appear.
