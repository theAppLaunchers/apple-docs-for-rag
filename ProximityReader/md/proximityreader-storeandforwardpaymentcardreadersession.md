``` source
class StoreAndForwardPaymentCardReaderSession
```

## Overview

Use a `StoreAndForwardPaymentCardReaderSession` object to read payment and loyalty cards from a properly configured device. You donâ€™t create this object directly. Instead, you obtain one by calling the prepareStoreAndForward() method of your PaymentCardReader object, which returns a session after the successful configuration of the device.

Maintain a strong reference to a session object for the duration of the card-reading process. You may use the same session object to perform multiple read operations, but you may perform only one read operation at a time
