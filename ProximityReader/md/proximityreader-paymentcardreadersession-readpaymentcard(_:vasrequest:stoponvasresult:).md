## Discussion

Call this method to read either a contactless payment card or a loyalty card. This method displays a system sheet with instructions on what the person needs to do. The system UI remains onscreen until the system reads the personâ€™s card, you cancel the operation, or an error occurs. If it reads a card successfully, the method returns the card information as a result.

When the `stopOnVasResult` parameter is `true`:

- If the customer taps their loyalty card while the UI is present, the system closes the sheet and returns VASReadResult as a result.

- If the customer taps their payment card while the UI is present, the system closes the sheet and returns PaymentCardReadResult as a result.

When the `stopOnVasResult` parameter is `false`:

- If the customer taps their Apple Pay Wallet, containing both a relevant loyalty card and a payment card, the system closes the sheet and returns both PaymentCardReadResult and VASReadResult as a result.

- If the customer taps their Apple Pay Wallet, containing only a relevant loyalty card, the system closes the sheet and returns VASReadResult as a result.

- If the customer taps their payment card, the system closes the sheet and returns PaymentCardReadResult as a result.

Throws

This method throws a PaymentCardReaderSession.ReadError if a person dismisses the sheet or the sheet fails to appear.
