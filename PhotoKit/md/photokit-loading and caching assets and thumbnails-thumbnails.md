# Loading and Caching Assets and Thumbnails

Request image, video, or Live Photos content, and cache for quick reuse.

## Overview

Photos automatically downloads or generates images to your specification, caching them for quick reuse. Use the PHImageManager class to request images of assets at a specified size, or AVFoundation objects to work with video assets. When working with large numbers of assets—for example, when populating a collection view with thumbnails—preload images in batches using the PHCachingImageManager subclass.
