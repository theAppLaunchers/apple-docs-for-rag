# CodeDirectoryHash

A constraint that matches the hash of a code directory of a code file or of a running or launching process.

``` source
struct CodeDirectoryHash
```

## Overview

In the context of ProcessCodeRequirement and LaunchCodeRequirement this constraint matches the hash of the chosen code directory for the running process, or the process the system is launching.

In the context of OnDiskCodeRequirement this constraint matches the hash of the code directory for the specified `SecStaticCodeRef` that best matches the current architecture. The best match is different for processes running on Intel and Apple silicon, including an Intel process running on Apple silicon with Rosetta. To reliably identify a code file using its code directory hash, use in(_:) and supply a list of the known code directory hash values.

## Topics

### Initializers

init(Data)

Match against a single code directory hash.

init(from: any Decoder) throws

Create a new instance by decoding from the given decoder

### Instance Methods

func encode(to: any Encoder) throws

Encodes this value into the given encoder

### Type Aliases

typealias DataType

The basic input data type for this constraint: Data

typealias OutType

The type of this constraint: CodeDirectoryHash

### Type Methods

static func `in`([CodeDirectoryHash.DataType]) -> CodeDirectoryHash.OutType

Match against any of the code directory hashes in the provided list.

static func `in`(CodeDirectoryHash.DataType...) -> CodeDirectoryHash.OutType

Match against any of the code directory hashes in the provided list.
