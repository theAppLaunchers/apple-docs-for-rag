# PlatformType

A constraint that tests whether a code file or running process targets a given platform.

``` source
struct PlatformType
```

## Overview

For ProcessCodeRequirement and LaunchCodeRequirement this constraint matches the platform type of the process as known to the kernel. For OnDiskCodeRequirement this constraint matches the platforms supported in Mach-O load commands. The OnDiskCodeRequirement will be matched against a SecStaticCodeRef. For this constraint to match, the SecStaticCodeRef must reference a Mach-O. If the SecStaticCodeRef references a specific architecture of a Mach-O then this constraint will be matched against the first LC_BUILD_VERSION or LC_VERSION_MIN\_\*OS load command in the Mach-O. If the SecStaticCodeRef references a file, then this constraint will match against the load commands in the architecture that is most likely to run on the platform the code is running on.

## Topics

### Structures

struct Value

Supported Platform Types for a process

### Initializers

init(PlatformType.Value)

Matches if the process is running as the specified platform type or if the file supports the specified platform type.

init(from: any Decoder) throws

Create a new instance by decoding from the given decoder

### Instance Methods

func encode(to: any Encoder) throws

Encodes this value into the given encoder

### Type Aliases

typealias DataType

The basic input data type of this constraint: `PlatformType.Value`..

typealias OutType

The type of this constraint: PlatformType

### Type Methods

static func `in`(PlatformType.DataType...) -> PlatformType.OutType

Matches if the process is running as any of the specified platform types or if the file supports any of the specified platform types.

static func `in`([PlatformType.DataType]) -> PlatformType.OutType

Matches if the process is running as any of the specified platform types or if the file supports any of the specified platform types.
