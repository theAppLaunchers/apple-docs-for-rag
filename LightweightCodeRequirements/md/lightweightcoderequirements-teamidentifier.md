## Topics

### Initializers

init(String)

Matches if the provided string matches the team identifier of the code.

init(from: any Decoder) throws

Create a new instance by decoding from the given decoder

### Instance Methods

func encode(to: any Encoder) throws

Encodes this value into the given encoder

### Type Aliases

typealias DataType

The basic input data type for this constraint: String.

typealias OutType

The type of this constraint: TeamIdentifier.

### Type Methods

static func `in`([TeamIdentifier.DataType]) -> TeamIdentifier.OutType

Matches if the team identifier of the code matches any of the provided team identifiers.

static func `in`(TeamIdentifier.DataType...) -> TeamIdentifier.OutType

Matches if the team identifier of the code matches any of the provided team identifiers.
