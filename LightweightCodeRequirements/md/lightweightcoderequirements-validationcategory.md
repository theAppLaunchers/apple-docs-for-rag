# ValidationCategory

A constraint that tests whether a code file or running process is signed in a way that conforms to the specified validation category.

``` source
struct ValidationCategory
```

## Overview

Validation categories are an indication of the type of signature on the file and how it is allowed to run.

## Topics

### Structures

struct Value

Supported Validation categories for signatures

### Initializers

init(ValidationCategory.Value)

Matches if the file or process is signed in a way that conforms to the specified category.

init(from: any Decoder) throws

Create a new instance by decoding from the given decoder

### Instance Methods

func encode(to: any Encoder) throws

Encodes this value into the given encoder

### Type Aliases

typealias DataType

The basic input data type for this constraint: `ValidationCategoryType`.

typealias OutType

The type of this constraint: ValidationCategory.

### Type Methods

static func `in`([ValidationCategory.DataType]) -> ValidationCategory.OutType

Matches if the file or process is signed in a way that conforms to any of the specified categories.

static func `in`(ValidationCategory.DataType...) -> ValidationCategory.OutType

Matches if the file or process is signed in a way that conforms to any of the specified categories.
