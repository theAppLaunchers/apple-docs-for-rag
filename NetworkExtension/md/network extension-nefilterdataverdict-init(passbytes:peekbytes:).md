    passBytes: Int,
    peekBytes: Int
)
```

## Parameters 

`passBytes`  

The number of bytes to pass to its final destination.

`peekBytes`  

The number of bytes after the end of the `passBytes` that the Filter Data Provider expects in the next call to handleOutboundData(from:readBytesStartOffset:readBytes:) or handleInboundData(from:readBytesStartOffset:readBytes:). The Filter Data Provider uses this chunk of data to make its next filtering decision.

To see all subsequent bytes, set this parameter to NEFilterFlowBytesMax.

## Return Value
