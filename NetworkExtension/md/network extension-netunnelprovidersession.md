``` source
class NETunnelProviderSession
```

## Overview

`NETunnelProviderSession` objects control network tunnel connections provided by Tunnel Provider extensions.

`NETunnelProviderSession` objects are not instantiated directly. Instead, each NETunnelProviderManager object has an associated `NETunnelProviderSession` as a read-only property.

## Topics

### Controlling the tunnel connection

func startTunnel(options: [String : Any]?) throws

Start the process of connecting the tunnel.

func stopTunnel()

Start the process of disconnecting the tunnel.

### Communicating with the tunnel provider

func sendProviderMessage(Data, responseHandler: ((Data?) -> Void)?) throws

Send a message to the Tunnel Provider extension. If the extension is not running, it should be launched to handle the message. If this method canâ€™t start sending the message it reports an error in the `returnError` parameter. If an error occurs while sending the message or returning the result, `nil` should be sent to the response handler as notification.
