``` source
var isEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The framework sets this value to NO when your app saves a configuration that overlaps with this configuration. This overlap occurs when a new NEAppPushManager saves a configuration with a matchSSIDs list that contains an SSID which is also a member of this managerâ€™s SSID list.
