Initializer

# init(remoteNetwork:remotePrefix:localNetwork:localPrefix:protocol:direction:)

Creates a rule that matches traffic by remote network, local network, protocol, and direction.

macOS 10.15â€“15.0Deprecated

``` source
init(
    remoteNetwork: NWHostEndpoint?,
    remotePrefix: Int,
    localNetwork: NWHostEndpoint?,
    localPrefix: Int,
    protocol: NENetworkRule.Protocol,
    direction: NETrafficDirection
)
```

## Parameters 

`remoteNetwork`  

An endpoint instance that contains the remote port and the remote address or network that the rule matches. This endpoint must contain an address, not a hostname.

`remotePrefix`  

An integer that in combination with the address in `remoteNetwork` specifies the remote network that the rule matches.

`localNetwork`  

An endpoint instance that contains the local port and the local address or network that the rule matches. This endpoint must contain an address, not a hostname.

`localPrefix`  

An integer that in combination with the address in localNetwork specifies the local network that the rule matches. The rule ignores this parameter if `localNetwork` is `nil`.

`protocol`  

The protocol that the rule matches.

`direction`  

The direction of network traffic that the rule matches.

## Discussion

If the port string of `remoteNetwork` is `0` or the empty string, then the rule matches traffic on any port coming from the remote network. If `remoteNetwork` is `nil`, the rule matches any remote network.

If the port string of `localNetwork` is `0` or the empty string, then the rule matches traffic on any port coming from the local network. If `localNetwork` is `nil`, the rule matches any local network.
