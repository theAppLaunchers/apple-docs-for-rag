# DNS proxy provider

Create an on-device DNS proxy using a custom protocol.

## Overview

A DNS proxy provider is an app extension that implements DNS proxying. You should create a DNS proxy provider if you want to take responsibility for resolving all DNS queries on the system. Typically this involves forwarding the queries in a way that improves performance, reliability or security. For example, a DNS proxy provider might:

- Forward DNS queries to a well-known Internet-wide DNS server

- Talk to a DNS proxying service using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT)

- Implement a completely custom DNS proxying protocol

For detailed information about DNS proxy provider deployment options, see TN3134: Network Extension provider deployment.
