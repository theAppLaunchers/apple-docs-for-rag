## Discussion

As the author of the DNS proxy, you decide what configuration the proxy needs. For example, if your proxy requires the IP addresses of servers to which DNS traffic can be redirected, you can use an array of strings to hold these values.

Initially, you store this array in the configuration profile, as described in Configuration Profile Reference. When you want to inspect or modify this data, you call loadFromPreferences(completionHandler:) to pull the configuration into memory. You access this memory through the proxy managerâ€™s providerProtocol property.
