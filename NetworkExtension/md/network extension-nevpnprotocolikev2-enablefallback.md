## Discussion

Wi-Fi Assist allows connections for foreground apps to switch over to cellular data when Wi-Fi connectivity is poor. When this value is `true`, the device brings up a tunnel over celluar to carry traffic thatâ€™s eligible for Wi-Fi Assist and also requires VPN. Enabling fallback requires that the server support multiple tunnels for a single user.

The default value of this property is `false`.
