Instance Property

# matchTools

An array of app rule objects that restrict the rule so it only matches network traffic generated from helper processes.

macOS 10.15.4+

``` source
var matchTools: [NEAppRule]? { get set }
```

## Discussion

Use this property to restrict this rule so it only matches network traffic that the matching app generates and all helper tool processes that the matching app spawns.

For example, to match network traffic generated by the `curl` command line tool run from `Terminal.app`, do the following:

1.  Create an NEAppRule for `Terminal.app`.

2.  Set the app ruleâ€™s matchTools property to an array that contains an NEAppRule for the `curl` command line tool.

Set this property to `nil` (the default) to match all network traffic generated by the matching app and all helper tool processes spawned by the matching app.
