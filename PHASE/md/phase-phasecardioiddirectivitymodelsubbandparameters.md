## Overview

This class defines one subband in the PHASECardioidDirectivityModelParameters classâ€™s `subbands`. Depending on the specific shape you define with pattern and sharpness, you can attenuate sound focused at frequency to the sides of the listener, while leaving the sound in front of or behind the listener unchanged.

## Topics

### Creating Cardioid Directivity Subband Parameters

init()

### Sizing the Subband

var frequency: Double

A frequency in the audio spectrum where the pattern and sharpness resonate most.

### Shaping Directivity

var pattern: Double

A shape that determines the direction of sound.

var sharpness: Double

The amount that the shape overlaps with bordering subbands.
