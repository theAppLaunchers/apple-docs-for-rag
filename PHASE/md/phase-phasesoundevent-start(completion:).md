## Discussion

Important

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
func start() async -> PHASESoundEvent.StartHandlerReason
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

This function returns immediately after instructing the engine to invoke the sound event. If a problem occurs, the function provides an error.

The sound eventâ€™s audio plays immediately if the app prepares the sound event in advance. Otherwise, the sound event begins preparing and then plays after preparation completes.

When the sound event plays or errors out, the framework invokes `completionHandler`, passing in a PHASESoundEvent.StartHandlerReason that explains the reason for the invocation.

Important

To play the same sound asset again, create another sound event object. After the first start(completion:) call on a particular `PHASESoundEvent` instance, subsequent calls have no effect.
