## Discussion

The default value is `false`. When `true`, the engine *normalizes* the audio stream â€” that is, it dynamically resizes loudness within a given range for a consistent listening experience. Normalization serves the benefit of assisting output level calibration. Apps that leave the value `false` need to normalize stream data manually before passing it into the framework (see pushStreamNodes).
