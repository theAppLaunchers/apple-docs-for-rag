## Discussion

The framework clamps the value to the range between `0` and `1`, where `0` silences the audio and `1` passes the audio through to the output at full volume. The default value is `1`.

When an app adds the entryâ€™s spatial pipeline (see entries) to a sound event, the framework observes no further adjustments to this property. To change the send level after that, adjust the sendLevelMetaParameterDefinition.
