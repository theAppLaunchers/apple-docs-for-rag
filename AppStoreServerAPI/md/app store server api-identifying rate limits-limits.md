# Identifying rate limits

Recognize the rate limits that apply to App Store Server API endpoints and handle them in your code.

## Overview

The App Store Server API limits the number of requests that you can submit to each endpoint within a specified timespan. The request limits apply per app.

The following table lists the rate limits for each endpoint in the production environment, expressed in requests per second. Limits are enforced on an hourly basis.

| Endpoint | Rate limit (per second) |
|----|----|
| Get Transaction Info | 50 |
| Get Transaction History | 50 |
| Get Transaction History V1 | 50 |
| Get All Subscription Statuses | 50 |
| Send Consumption Information | 50 |
| Get Notification History | 50 |
| Extend a Subscription Renewal Date | 20 |
| Look Up Order ID | 10 |
| Get Refund History | 10 |
| Get Refund History V1 | 10 |
| Extend Subscription Renewal Dates for All Active Subscribers | 1 |
| Request a Test Notification | 1 |
| Get Test Notification Status | 1 |

The rate limits in the sandbox environment are 10% of the limits in the table above.

The App Store server may make adjustments to reduce or increase these rate limits as needed at any time.

### Handle exceeded rate limits gracefully

If you exceed a per-hour limit, the API rejects the request with an `HTTP` `429` response, with a RateLimitExceededError in the body. Consider the following as you integrate the API:

- If you periodically call the API, throttle your requests to avoid exceeding the per-hour limit for an endpoint.

- Manage the `HTTP` `429` RateLimitExceededError in your error-handling process. For example, log the failure and queue the job to process it again at a later time.

- Check the `Retry-After` header if you receive the `HTTP` `429` error. This header contains a UNIX time, in milliseconds, that informs you when you can next send a request.
