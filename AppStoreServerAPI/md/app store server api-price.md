## Discussion

This value represents the price, in milliunits of the currency, of the In-App Purchase that the system records in the transaction. One unit of the currency equals 1000 milliunits.

The `price` value reflects all of the following:

- The price you configured in App Store Connect, which the system records on the purchase date (purchaseDate).

- The discount from a subscription offer in the offerIdentifier, if the transaction includes an offer.

- The quantity of a consumable in-app purchase. The price value shows the total amount of the transaction for the quantity the customer purchased.

The following table shows some examples of the `price` and currency parameters based on sample prices you might configure in App Store Connect:

| Configured price in App Store Connect | `price` parameter | `currency` parameter |
|----|----|----|
| \$1.99 (U.S. dollar) | 1990 | USD |
| KRW 3300 (South Korean won) | 3300000 | KRW |
| JPY 300 (Japanese yen) | 300000 | JPY |

To determine the storefront, use the storefront value in the transaction. Donâ€™t use the `currency` value to infer the storefront.

Important
