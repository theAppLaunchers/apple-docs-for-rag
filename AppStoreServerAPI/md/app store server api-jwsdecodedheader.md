## Discussion

The types JWSTransaction and JWSRenewalInfo contain headers that are JWSDecodedHeader objects when decoded. Use the information in the JWSDecodedHeader to validate the JWS signature. For more information about validating signatures, see the JSON Web Signature (JWS) IETF RFC 7515 specification.

The App Store signs transaction and renewal information that you receive in App Store Server Notifications V2 and in the App Store Server API. It uses the following `x5c` certificate chain, in order:

1.  A certificate that contains the public key that corresponds to the key the App Store uses to digitally sign the JWS. Section 4.11.10 Mac App Store Receipt Signing Certificates of the Apple Inc. Certificate Practice Statement Worldwide Developer Relations document defines the policy for this certificate.

2.  An Apple intermediate certificate from the Apple PKI site that starts with `Worldwide Developer Relations`.

3.  An Apple root certificate.

For more information, or to download Appleâ€™s root and intermediate certificates, see Apple PKI.
