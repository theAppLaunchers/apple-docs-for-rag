# isUpgraded

The Boolean value that indicates whether the customer upgraded to another subscription.

App Store Server API 1.0+

``` source
boolean isUpgraded
```

## Discussion

If `isUpgraded` is `true`, the customer has upgraded the subscription represented by this transaction to another subscription. This value appears in the transaction only when itâ€™s `true`. To determine the service that the customer is entitled to, look for another transaction that has a subscription with a higher level of service.
