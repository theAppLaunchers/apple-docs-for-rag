## Discussion

The `renewalDate` is a value thatâ€™s always present in the payload for auto-renewable subscriptions, even for expired subscriptions. This date indicates the expiration date of the most recent auto-renewable subscription purchase, including renewals, and may be in the past. For subscriptions that renew successfully, the renewalDate is the date when the subscription renews.
