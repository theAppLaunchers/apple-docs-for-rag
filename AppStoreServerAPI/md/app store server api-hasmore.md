Type

# hasMore

A Boolean value indicating whether the App Store has more transaction data.

App Store Server API 1.0+

``` source
boolean hasMore
```

## Discussion

This value is `true` if the App Store has more transactions for the customer. Call the endpoint again, including the revision or paginationToken query parameter, to get the next set of transactions.

If this value is `false`, there arenâ€™t any additional transactions.

The hasMore value appears in responses to endpoints that provide paginated results, such as NotificationHistoryResponse, HistoryResponse, and RefundHistoryResponse.
