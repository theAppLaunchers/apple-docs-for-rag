# Exporting file provider metrics data

Download and analyze usage, consistency, and error data.

## Overview

Use CloudKit Console to create a data export token that you use to export file provider metrics for your apps. Request data from iCloud web services, and download the data when the request is complete. For more information on CloudKit and CloudKit Console, see Build apps using CloudKit.

You can download three different reports that provide file provider metrics:

Consistency  
A summary of the state of the file provider domain, gathered daily by the system’s consistency checker. This report also contains information on one item from the pending set that’s encountered an error. The *pending set* contains any items in the file provider that haven’t synced for over a minute. The *super pending set* contains any items in either the file provider or the filesystem that haven’t synced for over a minute.

Usage  
A summary of the kinds of items that a file provider stores on someone’s device, along with the number of materialized items, dataless items, and the total space used by items. A *materialized item* is an item for which the system stores content on someone’s device. A *dataless item* is an item that the system synchronizes on the device, and downloads the content on demand when someone opens it.

Dynamic errors  
A list of errors that occurred during file provider operations, along with additional details you can use to investigate the errors.

Note

If you have any questions about the data made available in this API, including about how Apple applies privacy measures to protect user privacy and complies with legal obligations, contact Apple through Feedback Assistant by selecting the following option:

### Create a data export token

To access log data for your apps, create a data export token by following these steps:

1.  Navigate to CloudKit Console settings and log in.

2.  Click Tokens.

3.  Click Create Data Export Token.

4.  Give the token a name, and an optional description.

5.  Choose the bundle identifier for the app for which you want to download data.

6.  Choose the data set you want to download.

7.  Set an expiration date for the token, up to a maximum of 6 months in the future.

8.  Click Create Data Export Token.

9.  Securely store the token you create in step 8.

Note

If you navigate back to the CloudKit Console later, you can’t see the data export token’s value again.

The token you create is restricted to your developer account, and only gives you access to the data set you requested for the specified app.

### Create a data export request

Make an HTTPS `POST` request to the data export request endpoint:

- `https://api.icloud.apple.com/v1/dataExports/fpfs/teams/{teamId}/appId/{appId}/datasetName/{dataset}/request`

Substitute these values:

`{teamId}`  
Your Apple Developer team identifier.

`{appId}`  
Your app’s bundle identifier.

`{dataset}`  
To request a consistency report, use `consistency`. To request a usage report, use `usage`. To request a dynamic errors report, use `dynamicerrors`.

Supply your data export token in the `X-Apple-CloudKit-Management-Token` header, and provide a JSON object in the body with these fields:

`startDate`  
The earliest date for which to include data, in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`. The date needs to be 90 or fewer days in the past.

`endDate`  
The latest date for which to include data, in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`. The date needs to be 1–30 days after `startDate`, and one or more days in the past.

`dataDownloadUrlExpiresInMinutes`  
The number of minutes after you receive the download for which the download URL needs to remain valid, between `20` and `60`.

The server responds with a JSON object that contains these fields:

`statusUrl`  
A URL you use to check the status of your request.

`requestedAt`  
The time at which you requested the data export, in ISO8601 format.

```
```

The data export request endpoint might return the following HTTP status codes that represent errors:

`400`  
The request is badly formed.

`401`  
The data export token is invalid.

`500`  
An internal error occurred.

You can request a download that covers the same date range as a previous download. If you make a repeat request within 24 hours, the server returns the same status URL as the original request.  If you make a repeat request after 24 hours, the server creates a new request with a new status URL, and any events within the requested time range that are logged after the original request was made are included in the new report.

Note

The status URLs for all requests are available for 6 months after you make the request. Make sure you use the latest URLs for checking status and downloading reports.

### Check the status of your data export

Make an HTTPS `GET` request to the status URL, passing your data export token in the `X-Apple-CloudKit-Management-Token` header.

The server responds with a JSON object that contains these fields:

`status`  
One of these four strings: `PROCESSING`, `FAILED`, `EXPIRED`, or `SUCCESS`.

`requestedAt`  
The time at which you requested the data export, in ISO8601 format.

`downloadDetails`  
If the status is `PROCESSING`, `EXPIRED`, or `FAILED`, this key isn’t set. If the status is `SUCCESS`, it’s a JSON object that contains `dataUrl`, the URL you use to get the exported data; and `expiresAt`, the time at which the data URL expires.

Apple servers retain the exported data for 6 months. To re-download the data, make another `GET` request to the status URL and download the data from the new download URL.

```
```

The data export status endpoint might return the following HTTP status codes that represent errors:

`400`  
The request is badly formed.

`404`  
The data export token is invalid.

`500`  
An internal error occurred.

### Download the exported data

Make an HTTPS `GET` request to URL in the status object’s `downloadDetails.dataUrl` field to receive a CSV file that contains your exported data:

```
```

### Analyze the CSV file

`_build`
