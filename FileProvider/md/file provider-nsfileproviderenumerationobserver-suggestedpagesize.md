## Discussion

The system suggests a page size to optimize performance based on the enumerationâ€™s context. The system can request the enumeration of a container for various reasons, such as if the user opens the directory in Finder, opens a file in an application, or if the system needs to materialize the contents of a directory. Each case has its own performance profile.

While using the suggested page size helps ensure the best user experience, the system enforces a maximum of 100 times the suggested size.
