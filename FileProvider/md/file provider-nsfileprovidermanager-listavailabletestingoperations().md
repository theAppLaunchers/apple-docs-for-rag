## Discussion

Important

Before calling this method, you must set the domainâ€™s testingModes property to include the interactive value.

The system waits for all the pending disk and working set updates before returning the list of available operations. The operations that it returns may become invalid if the system receives new events, or when you schedule and execute operations using the run(_:) method.
