## Discussion

If the File Provider extension does not use domains, this property is set to `nil`. By default, a File Provider extension does not have any domains.

A new NSFileProviderExtension object is created for each domain added to the File Provider manager. The new File Providerâ€™s domain property is set to the added domain, and any items returned by the File Provider belong to that domain.
