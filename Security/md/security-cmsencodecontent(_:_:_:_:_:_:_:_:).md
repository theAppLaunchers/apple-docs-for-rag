Function

# CMSEncodeContent(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Encodes a message and obtains the result in one high-level function call.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
func CMSEncodeContent(
    _ signers: CFTypeRef?,
    _ recipients: CFTypeRef?,
    _ eContentTypeOID: CFTypeRef?,
    _ detachedContent: Bool,
    _ signedAttributes: CMSSignedAttributes,
    _ content: UnsafeRawPointer,
    _ contentLen: Int,
    _ encodedContentOut: UnsafeMutablePointer?
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`signers`  

The identity object for the identity of one signer, specified as type `SecIdentityRef`, or a `CFArray` of identity objects of type`SecIdentityRef`. Pass `NULL` for this parameter if you do not want to sign the message.

`recipients`  

A certificate containing a public encryption key for one message recipient, specified as a certificate object (type `SecCertificateRef`), or a `CFArray` of certificate objects. Pass NULL for this parameter if you do not want to encrypt the message.

`eContentTypeOID`  

The object identifier for the encapsulated data in a signed message, in the form of a Core Foundation stringâ€”`CFSTR("1.2.840.113549.1.7.1")`, for example.

This parameter is optional. If you pass `NULL`, the value `id-data` is used. (This is the normal encapsulated content type for applications such as S/MIME, which uses it to indicate MIME-encoded content.) You can pass any value that is meaningful to your application.

`detachedContent`  

Specify `TRUE` if the signed data is to be separate from the message; that is, if the message is_not\_ to include the data to be signed. You cannot specify `TRUE` for this parameter for an encrypted message.

`signedAttributes`  

Attribute flags as defined in CMSSignedAttributes. Attributes are optional for signed messages and are not used in other types of CMS messages. The use of attributes is described in section 2.5 of the S/MIME 3.1 specification.

`content`  

The content that you want to add to the message. The content must conform to the type set in the CMSEncoderSetEncapsulatedContentType parameter (or type `id-data` if that function has not been called).

`contentLen`  

The length of the content being added, in bytes.

`encodedContentOut`  

On return, points to the encoded message. You must use the `CFRelease` function to free this reference when you are finished using it.

## Return Value

A result code. See Security Framework Result Codes.

## Discussion

If you use this function, you must include content and you must provide valid non-`NULL` input for at least one of the `signers` and `recipients` parameters. You can both encrypt and sign a message; however, you cannot use detached content with an encrypted message. If you want to create a message that contains certificates and no other content, you must use the CMSEncoderAddSupportingCerts(_:_:) function instead of this one. To gain more control over the process of encoding a message, call the sequence of functions beginning with the CMSEncoderCreate(_:) function instead of this one.
