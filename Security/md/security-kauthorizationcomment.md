Global Variable

# kAuthorizationComment

Indicates comments for a rule.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
var kAuthorizationComment: String { get }

## Discussion

The comments appear in the policy database for the administrator to understand what the rule is for. Rule comments are not the same as localized descriptions which are presented to the user.
