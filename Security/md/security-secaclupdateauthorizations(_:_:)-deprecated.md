An ACL object that identifies the access control list entry for which you wish to set authorization tags.

## Discussion

An ACL entry includes a list of trusted apps, the name of the keychain item as it appears in user prompts, the prompt selector flag, and a list of one or more operations to which this ACL entry applies. Use this method to set a list of operations for an ACL entry, or set the kSecACLAuthorizationAny tag to allow all operations. Use the SecACLSetContents(_:_:_:_:) method to set the other information.

Because an ACL entry is always associated with an access instance, when you modify an entry, you are modifying the access instance as well.
