## Parameters 

`aclRef`

## Return Value

## Discussion

This method fails if you attempt to remove the owner entry because an access instance must have exactly one such ACL at all times. If you need to change ownership settings, modify the existing owner entry rather than replacing it. In particular, use the SecAccessCopyMatchingACLList(_:_:) method with the kSecACLAuthorizationChangeACL authorization to find the existing entry, and the SecACLSetContents(_:_:_:_:) method to change it as needed.
