# valid

The code is dynamically valid.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
static var valid: SecCodeStatus { get }
```

## Discussion

Code thatâ€™s dynamically valid is running code that started properly signed and has not been invalidated since it started. The valid bit can not be set on running code; it can only be cleared. If you do not set the `kSecCodeStatusValid` flag during creation of the guest with the SecCodeGetTypeID() function, then the new guest is created dynamically invalid and can never become dynamically valid. Note that this bit does not make any representations about the static validity of the code.
