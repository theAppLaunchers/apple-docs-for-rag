``` source
let kSecCodeInfoRequirements: CFString
```

## Discussion

The value is a CFString object. If there is an explicit designated requirement, then itâ€™s included in this text string.

Specify the kSecCSRequirementInformation flag when calling the SecCodeCopySigningInformation(_:_:_:) function to get this information.
