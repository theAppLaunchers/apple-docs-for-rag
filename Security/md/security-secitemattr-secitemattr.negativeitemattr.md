## Discussion

You use this tag to set or get a value of type `Boolean` that indicates whether there is a valid password associated with this keychain item. This is useful if your application doesnâ€™t want a password for some particular service to be stored in the keychain, but prefers that it always be entered by the user. The item, which is typically invisible and with zero-length data, acts as a placeholder.
