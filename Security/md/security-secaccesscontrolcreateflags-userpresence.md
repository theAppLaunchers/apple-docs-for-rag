Restricting keychain item accessibility

## Discussion

Biometry doesnâ€™t have to be available or enrolled. The item is still accessible by Touch ID even if fingers are added or removed, or by Face ID if the user is re-enrolled.

This option is equivalent to specifying biometryAny, or, and devicePasscode.
