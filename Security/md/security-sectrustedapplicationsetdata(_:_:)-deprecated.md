## Discussion

If you use the SecTrustedApplicationCopyData(_:_:) method to extract the data from a trusted app instance for storage or transmission, you can use the SecTrustedApplicationSetData(_:_:) method to insert that data into a new trusted app. Doing so creates an object that identifies the same app as the original trusted app instance.
