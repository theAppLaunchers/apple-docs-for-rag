# errSecCSDBAccess

Cannot access signature database.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
var errSecCSDBAccess: OSStatus { get }
```

## Discussion

This error is returned when the system is attempting to sign unsigned code ad-hoc and couldnâ€™t write to the signature database because of some problem other than a permission problem. For example, the signature database might be missing or corrupted.
