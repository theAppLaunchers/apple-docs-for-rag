Type Alias

# sec_trust_t

These are os_object compatible and ARC-able wrappers around existing CoreFoundation Security types, including: SecTrustRef, SecIdentityRef, and SecCertificateRef. They allow clients to use these types in os_object-type APIs and data structures. The underlying CoreFoundation types may be extracted and used by clients as needed.
