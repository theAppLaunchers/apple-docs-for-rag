SecKeychain is deprecated

## Parameters 

`attrList`  

A pointer to the attribute list to release. Pass `NULL` if there is no attribute list to release.

`data`  

A pointer to the data buffer to release. Pass `NULL` if there is no data to release.

## Return Value

A result code. See Security Framework Result Codes.

## Discussion

Because the SecKeychainFindInternetPassword(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:) and SecKeychainFindGenericPassword(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:) functions call the SecKeychainItemCopyContent(_:_:_:_:_:) function, you must call `SecKeychainItemFreeContent` to release the data buffers after calls to those functions as well.

Because the `SecKeychainItemCopyContent` function does not allocate buffers until they are needed, you should not call the `SecKeychainItemFreeContent` function unless data is actually returned to you.
