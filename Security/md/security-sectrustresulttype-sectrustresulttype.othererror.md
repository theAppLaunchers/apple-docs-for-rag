## Discussion

This value indicates that evaluation failed for some other reason. This can be caused by either a revoked certificate or by OS-level errors that are unrelated to the certificates themselves.

You might receive the SecTrustResultType.otherError value after an evaluation, but you canâ€™t store the value as part of the user trust settings with a call to the SecTrustSettingsSetTrustSettings(_:_:_:) method.
