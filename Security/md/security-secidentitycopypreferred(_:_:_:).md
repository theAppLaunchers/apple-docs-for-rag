Function

# SecIdentityCopyPreferred(\_:\_:\_:)

Retrieves the preferred identity for the specified name and key use.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
func SecIdentityCopyPreferred(
    _ name: CFString,
    _ keyUsage: CFArray?,
    _ validIssuers: CFArray?
) -> SecIdentity?
```

## Parameters 

`name`  

A string containing an email address (RFC 822) or other name for which a preferred identity is requested.

`keyUsage`  

An array containing a list of usage attributes (kSecAttrCanEncrypt, for example), or `NULL` if you do not want to request an identity for a particular usage. See Attribute Item Keys for a complete list of possible usage attributes.

`validIssuers`  

An array of `CFDataRef` objects whose contents are the subject names of allowable issuers, as returned by a call to SSLCopyDistinguishedNames(_:_:). Pass `NULL` to allow any issuer.

## Return Value

Returns an identity, or `nil` if no identity from one of the specified issuers has been set as the preferred identity for the specified name and usage. In Objective-C, call the CFRelease function to free the identityâ€™s memory when you are done with it.

## Discussion

If a preferred identity has not been set for the supplied name, this function returns `NULL`. Your code should then perform a search for possible identities by calling SecItemCopyMatching(_:_:).
