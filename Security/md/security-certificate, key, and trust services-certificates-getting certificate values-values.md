# Getting Certificate Values

Obtain all the values associated with a certificate.

## Overview

In macOS, you can also dig deeper into the certificate content using a call to the SecCertificateCopyValues(_:_:_:) function:

- Swift
- Objective-C

```
var error: Unmanaged?
guard let dict = SecCertificateCopyValues(certificate,nil,&error) else {
    throw error!.takeRetainedValue() as Error
}
```

```
CFErrorRef error = NULL;
NSDictionary* dict = (NSDictionary*)CFBridgingRelease(  // ARC takes ownership
                       SecCertificateCopyValues(certificate, NULL, &error)
                    );
if (!dict) {
    NSError *err = CFBridgingRelease(error);            // ARC takes ownership
    // Handle the error. . .
}
```

The return value is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the OID values found in Certificate OIDs. Each value is itself a dictionary that contains information about the certificateâ€™s fields and extensions.
