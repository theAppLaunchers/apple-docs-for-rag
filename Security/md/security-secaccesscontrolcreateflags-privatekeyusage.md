Protecting keys with the Secure Enclave

## Discussion

This option can be combined with any other access control flags.

You typically use this constraint when you create a key pair and store the private key inside a deviceâ€™s Secure Enclave (by specifying the kSecAttrTokenID attribute with a value of kSecAttrTokenIDSecureEnclave). This makes the private key available for use in signing and verification tasks that happen inside the Secure Enclave with calls to the SecKeyRawSign(_:_:_:_:_:_:) and SecKeyRawVerify(_:_:_:_:_:_:) functions. An attempt to use this constraint while generating a key pair outside the Secure Enclave fails. Similarly, an attempt to sign a block with a private key generated without this constraint inside the Secure Enclave fails.
