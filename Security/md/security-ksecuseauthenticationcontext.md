## Discussion

The corresponding value is of type LAContext, and represents a reusable local authentication context that should be used for keychain item authentication, according to the following rules:

- If this key is not specified, and if the item requires authentication, a new context will be created, used once, and discarded.

- If this key is specified with a context that has been previously authenticated, the operation will succeed without asking user for authentication.

- If this key is specified with a context that has not been previously authenticated, the system attempts authentication on the context. If successful, the context may be reused in subsequent keychain operations.
