Global Variable

# kSecCodeInfoImplicitDesignatedRequirement

A key whose value is the designated requirement (DR) that the system generated—or would have generated—for the code in the absence of an explicitly-declared DR.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
let kSecCodeInfoImplicitDesignatedRequirement: CFString
```

## Discussion

The value is a SecRequirement object. The actual designated requirement is returned by the kSecCodeInfoDesignatedRequirement key. If the DR was implicitly generated by the system, the two values are the same. You can use this fact to test for an explicit DR.

Specify the kSecCSRequirementInformation flag when calling the SecCodeCopySigningInformation(_:_:_:) function to get this information.
