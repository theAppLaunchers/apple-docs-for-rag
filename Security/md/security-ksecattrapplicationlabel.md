## Discussion

The corresponding value is of type doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/corefoundation/cfdata-rv9 and contains a label for this item. This attribute is different from the kSecAttrLabel attribute, which is intended to be human-readable. Instead, this attribute is used to look up a key programmatically; in particular, for keys of class kSecAttrKeyClassPublic and kSecAttrKeyClassPrivate, the value of this attribute is the hash of the public key.
