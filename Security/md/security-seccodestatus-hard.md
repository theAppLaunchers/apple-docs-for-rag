# hard

The code prefers to be denied access to resources if gaining access would invalidate it.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
static var hard: SecCodeStatus { get }
```

## Discussion

This bit can not be cleared on running code; it can only be set. It is undefined whether code that has the hard flag set but that starts out with the valid bit cleared (that is, itâ€™s already invalid) will still be denied access to a resource that would invalidate it if it were still valid. That is, the code may or may not get access to such a resource while being invalid.
