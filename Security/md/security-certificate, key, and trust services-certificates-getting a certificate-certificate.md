# Getting a Certificate

Obtain a certificate from an identity, from DER-encoded data, or from the keychain.

## Overview

You use functions of the certificate, key, and trust services API to manage and manipulate certificates. The API defines the SecCertificate opaque type to hold certificate objects. You typically use such an object to indicate the certificate to use for a particular cryptographic operation, such as evaluating trust. How you get a certificate reference depends on where the certificate is stored or how itâ€™s provided to you. For example, it might come from any of the following:

- **An identity.** When you read an identity from a password-protected file or from the keychain (as described in Importing an Identity and Storing an Identity in the Keychain, respectively), you can extract the certificate it contains (see Parsing an Identity). In macOS, you can also store a certificate in an identity along with its associated private key (see Creating an Identity).

- **DER-encoded data.** You can export a certificate as DER-encoded data that you then store on disk or send through the network. Similarly, you can restore a certificate from this kind of data. See Storing a DER-Encoded X.509 Certificate for details.

- **The keychain.** Just as with keys and passwords, you can store a certificate in a keychain and later retrieve it from there. See Storing a Certificate in the Keychain for details.
