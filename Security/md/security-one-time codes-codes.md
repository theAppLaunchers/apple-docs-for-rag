## Overview

iOS detects when an SMS message contains a one-time code and offers that code for AutoFill in one-time code fields in apps and websites. Improve the usability of one-time codes in your apps and websites by setting the content type of fields where people enter one-time codes. Improve security by adopting domain-bound codes to make it harder for people to enter one-time codes into phishing websites.
