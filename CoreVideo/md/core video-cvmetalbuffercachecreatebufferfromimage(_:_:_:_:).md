    _ imageBuffer: CVImageBuffer,
    _ bufferOut: UnsafeMutablePointer

## Discussion

```
@function   CVMetalBufferCacheCreateBuffer
@abstract   Creates a CVMetalBuffer object from an existing CVImageBuffer
@param      allocator The CFAllocatorRef to use for allocating the CVMetalBuffer object. May be NULL.
@param      bufferCache The buffer cache object that will manage the buffer.
@param      buffer The CVImageBuffer that you want to create a CVMetalBuffer from.
@param      bufferOut The newly created buffer object will be placed here.
@result     Returns kCVReturnSuccess on success
@discussion Creates or returns a cached CVMetalBuffer object mapped to the CVImageBuffer.
            This creates a live binding between the CVImageBuffer and underlying CVMetalBuffer buffer object.

            IMPORTANT NOTE: Clients should retain CVMetalBuffer objects until they are done using the images in them.
            Retaining a CVMetalBuffer is your way to indicate that you're still using the image in the buffer, and that it should not be recycled yet.
