## Discussion

The width, in pixels, of the smallest byte-addressable group of pixels (type `CFNumber`). Used to assist with allocating memory for pixel formats that donâ€™t have an integer value for bytes per pixel. Assumed to be 1 if this key is not present. Here are some examples of block widths for standard pixel formats:

- 8-bit luminance only, block width is 1, the bits per block value is 8.

- 16-bit 1555 RGB, block width is 1, the bits per block value is 16.

- 32-bit 8888 ARGB, block width is 1, the bits per block value is 32.

- 2vuy (CbYCrY), block width is 2, the bits per block value is 32.

- 1-bit bitmap, block width is 8, the bits per block value is 8.

- v210, block width is 6, the bits per block value is 128 .

let kCVPixelFormatContainsRGB: CFString

let kCVPixelFormatContainsYCbCr: CFString

let kCVPixelFormatName: CFString

The name of the pixel format (type `CFString`). This should be the same as the codec name you would use in QuickTime.

let kCVPixelFormatConstant: CFString

The pixel format constant for QuickTime.

let kCVPixelFormatCodecType: CFString

The codec type (type `CFString`). For example, `'2vuy'` or `k422YpCbCr8CodecType`.

let kCVPixelFormatFourCC: CFString

The Microsoft FourCC equivalent code for this pixel format (type `CFString`).

let kCVPixelFormatContainsAlpha: CFString

A Boolean value where kCFBooleanTrue indicates that the format contains alpha and some images may be considered transparent; kCFBooleanFalse indicates that there is no alpha and images are always opaque.

let kCVPixelFormatPlanes: CFString

let kCVPixelFormatBlockHeight: CFString

The height, in pixels, of the smallest byte-addressable group of pixels (type `CFNumber`). Assumed to be 1 if this key is not present.

let kCVPixelFormatBitsPerBlock: CFString

let kCVPixelFormatBlockHorizontalAlignment: CFString

The horizontal alignment requirements of this format (type `CFNumber`). For example,the alignment for v210 would be 8 here for the horizontal case to match the standard v210 row alignment value of 48. Assumed to be 1 if this key is not present.
