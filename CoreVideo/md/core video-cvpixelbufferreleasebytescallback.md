A type that defines a release callback function.

iOS 4.0+iPadOS 4.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.4+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 4.0+

``` source
typealias CVPixelBufferReleaseBytesCallback = (UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, UnsafeRawPointer?) -> Void
```

## Parameters 

`releaseRefCon`  

A pointer to application-defined data. This pointer is the same as that passed in the `releaseRefCon` parameter of CVPixelBufferCreateWithBytes(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:).

`baseAddress`  

A pointer to the base address of the memory holding the pixels. This pointer is the same as that passed in the `baseAddress` parameter of CVPixelBufferCreateWithBytes(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:).

## Discussion

When you create a pixel buffer using CVPixelBufferCreateWithBytes(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:), you can optionally pass a callback function thatâ€™s invoked when the system frees the pixel buffer. Use this callback function to release the pixel data and perform any other cleanup needed when the buffer is released.

You define a callback function as shown below:

- Swift
- Objective-C

```
```

```
// Define a function to call when the pixel buffer is freed.
void releaseCallback(void *releaseRefCon, const void *baseAddress) {
    free((void *)baseAddress);
    // Perform additional cleanup as needed.
}
```

### Callbacks
