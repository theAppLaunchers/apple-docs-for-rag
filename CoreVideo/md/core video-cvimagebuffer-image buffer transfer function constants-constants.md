# Image Buffer Transfer Function Constants

Constants that indicate the transfer function for the image buffer.

## Overview

Use the kCVImageBufferTransferFunctionKey key to attach one of these values to the image buffer. The transfer function describes the tonality of an image for use in color matching operations, along with a color primaries gamut (See Image Buffer Color Primaries Constants for more information.). Most apps should specify the kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_ITU_R_709_2 transfer function.

## Topics

### Constants

let kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_ITU_R_709_2: CFString

A key to the transfer function for high-definition and standard-definition video.

let kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_SMPTE_240M_1995: CFString

A key to the transfer function for HDTV interim video.

let kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_UseGamma: CFString

A key to the transfer function thatâ€™s defined by the gamma level value of the image buffer.

let kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_sRGB: CFString

let kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_ITU_R_2020: CFString

let kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_SMPTE_ST_428_1: CFString

let kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_ITU_R_2100_HLG: CFString

let kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_SMPTE_ST_2084_PQ: CFString
