Instance Property

# memoryBalloonDevices

The array of devices that you use to adjust the amount of memory available to the guest system.

macOS 11.0+

``` source
var memoryBalloonDevices: [VZMemoryBalloonDevice] { get }
```

## Discussion

If you included a VZVirtioTraditionalMemoryBalloonDeviceConfiguration object in the configuration of your VM, this property contains a corresponding VZVirtioTraditionalMemoryBalloonDevice object. Use that object to adjust the amount of memory available to the guest operating system.

If you didnâ€™t include a memory balloon object in your configuration, this property contains an empty array.
