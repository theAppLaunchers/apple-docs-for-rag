# VZStorageDeviceAttachment

The common behaviors for storage devices in the guest system.

macOS 11.0+

``` source
class VZStorageDeviceAttachment
```

## Overview

A VZStorageDeviceAttachment object defines the implementation of a storage interface in a virtual machine. You use the attachment object to specify the source of the storage on the host computer.

Donâ€™t create VZStorageDeviceAttachment objects directly. Instead, instantiate an appropriate subclass such as VZDiskImageStorageDeviceAttachment, which provides storage using a disk image.
