## Overview

To set up a new VM compatible with the restore image, use mostFeaturefulSupportedConfiguration to obtain the hardwareModel of the VZMacPlatformConfiguration. Then, create a VZMacOSRestoreImage object by loading an installation media file. Initialize a VZMacOSInstaller object with this `VZMacOSRestoreImage` object to install the operating system onto a VM.

Important

Loading a restore image requires the app to have the com.apple.security.virtualization entitlement.
