Instance Property

# timeout

The timeout value in seconds for the connection between the client and server.

macOS 14.0+

``` source
var timeout: TimeInterval { get }
```

## Discussion

When the timeout expires, the client attempts to reconnect with the server. If after several retries, the client canâ€™t reestablish a connection to the server, the framework invokes the attachment(_:didEncounterError:) delegate method.
