Instance Method

# connect(toPort:completionHandler:)

Initiates a connection to the specified port of the guest operating system.

macOS 11.0+

``` source
func connect(
    toPort port: UInt32,
    completionHandler: @escaping (Result) -> Void
)
```

## Parameters 

`port`  

The destination port number in the guest operating system.

`completionHandler`  

The block to execute with the results of the connection attempt. This block has no return value and takes the following parameter:

result  
The result of the connection attempt. On a successful attempt, this value is the VZVirtioSocketConnection object to use for communications. On an unsuccessful attempt, this value is the error object that indicates why the connection failed.

## Discussion

This method initiates the connection asynchronously, and executes the completion handler when the results are available. If the guest operating system doesnâ€™t listen for connections to the specifed port, this method does nothing.

For a successful connection, this method sets the sourcePort property of the resulting VZVirtioSocketConnection object to a random port number.
