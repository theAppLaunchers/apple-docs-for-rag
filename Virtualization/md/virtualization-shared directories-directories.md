# Shared directories

Configure devices that share directories from the host into the guest system.

## Overview

Shared directories allow you expose specific directories in the macOS file system to the guest operating system running in a VM, this allows your user to share files between the host and guest operating system. To enable shared directory device support in Linux, configure the Linux guest kernel to enable the `CONFIG_VIRTIO_FS` support.

Configure a VIRTIO file system device using a VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration. The guest can use the tag label to mount and access the host resources.

The VZDirectoryShare on the configuration defines the host directories to expose to the guest. To limit or expose new directories to the guest while the VM is running, you can update the directory share with VZVirtioFileSystemDevice.

Use VZSingleDirectoryShare to share the immediate contents of a single directory on the host, or use VZMultipleDirectoryShare to share multiple directories from the host and include a specific name for each shared directory.

Note

Shared directories in macOS VMs are only available in macOS 13 and later.
