# VZVirtioSocketConnection

A port-based connection between the guest operating system and the host computer.

macOS 11.0+

``` source
class VZVirtioSocketConnection
```

## Overview

A VZVirtioSocketConnection object contains the port information for the guest operating system and host computer. You donâ€™t create connection objects directly. When the guest operating system initiates a connection, the virtual machine creates the connection object and passes it to the appropriate VZVirtioSocketListener object, which forwards the object to its delegate. When the virtual machine opens a connection to a guest port, the connect(toPort:) method (Objective-C) or connect(toPort:completionHandler:) method (Swift) pass the connection object to your completion handler.

## Topics
