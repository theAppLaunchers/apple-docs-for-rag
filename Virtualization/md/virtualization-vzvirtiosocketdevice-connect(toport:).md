Instance Method

# connect(toPort:)

Initiates a connection to the specified port of the guest operating system.

macOS 11.0+

``` source
func connect(toPort port: UInt32) async throws -> VZVirtioSocketConnection
```

## Parameters 

`port`  

The destination port number in the guest operating system.

## Discussion

This method initiates the connection asynchronously, and executes the completion handler when the results are available. If the guest operating system doesnâ€™t listen for connections to the specifed port, this method does nothing.

For a successful connection, this method sets the sourcePort property of the resulting VZVirtioSocketConnection object to a random port number.
