# VZDirectorySharingDevice

The base class that represents a directory sharing device in a VM.

macOS 12.0+

``` source
class VZDirectorySharingDevice
```

## Overview

Donâ€™t instantiate `VZDirectorySharingDevice` directly; configure a directory sharing device first by using VZVirtualMachineConfiguration through a subclass of VZDirectorySharingDeviceConfiguration.

When you create a VZVirtualMachine from the configuration, the directory sharing devices are available through the `VZVirtualMachine.directorySharingDevices` property.

The real type of `VZDirectorySharingDevice` corresponds to the type used by the configuration. For example, a VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration leads to a device of type VZVirtioFileSystemDevice.
