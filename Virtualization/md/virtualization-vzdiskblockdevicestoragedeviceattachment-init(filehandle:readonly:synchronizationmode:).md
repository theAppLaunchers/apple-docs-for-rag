Initializer

# init(fileHandle:readOnly:synchronizationMode:)

Creates a new block storage device attachment from a file handle and with the specified access mode, synchronization mode, and error object that you provide.

macOS 14.0+

``` source
init(
    fileHandle: FileHandle,
    readOnly: Bool,
    synchronizationMode: VZDiskSynchronizationMode
) throws
```

## Parameters 

`fileHandle`  

The FileHandle to a block device to attach to this VM.

`readOnly`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether this disk attachment is read-only; otherwise, if the file handle allows writes, the device can write data into it.

`synchronizationMode`  

The VZDiskSynchronizationMode value that defines how the disk synchronizes with the underlying storage when the guest operating system flushes data.

## Discussion

Note

The disk attachment retains the file handle, and the handle must be open when the virtual machine starts.

The `readOnly` parameter affects how the Virtualization framework exposes the disk to the guest operating system by the storage controller. If you intend to use the disk in read-only mode, itâ€™s also a best practice to open the file handle as read-only.
