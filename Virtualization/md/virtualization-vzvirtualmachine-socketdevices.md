The array of socket devices that the VM configures for use ports in the guest VM.

macOS 11.0+

``` source
var socketDevices: [VZSocketDevice] { get }
```

## Discussion

If you included a VZVirtioSocketDeviceConfiguration object in the configuration of your VM, this property contains a corresponding VZVirtioSocketDevice object. Use that object to configure the ports your VM makes available to the guest operating system.

If you didnâ€™t include a socket device in your configuration, this property contains an empty array.
