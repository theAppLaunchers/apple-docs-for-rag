# VZFileSerialPortAttachment

An attachment point that writes data from the guest system to a file.

macOS 11.0+

``` source
class VZFileSerialPortAttachment
```

## Overview

Use a VZFileSerialPortAttachment object to configure a one-way serial port from the guest operating system to the virtual machine. When the guest sends data to the serial port, the virtual machine writes that data to the specified file. You canâ€™t use this serial port to send data back to the guest.

Create a VZSerialPortAttachment object and assign it to an appropriate subclass of VZSerialPortConfiguration object, such as VZVirtioConsoleDeviceConfiguration. The file you use to create this object must be writable.

## Topics
