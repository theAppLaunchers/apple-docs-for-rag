# VZVirtioSocketListener

An object that listens for port-based connection requests from the guest operating system.

macOS 11.0+

``` source
class VZVirtioSocketListener
```

## Overview

Use a VZVirtioSocketListener object to route connection requests to your associated delegate object. The socket listener object handles incoming connection requests from the guest operating system and directs them to the methods of its associated delegate object. You may use the same listener object to monitor connections on multiple ports.

After creating a VZVirtioSocketListener object, assign a custom object to its delegate property. The delegate must implement the VZVirtioSocketListenerDelegate protocol. To connect the listener to a port, call the setSocketListener(_:forPort:) method of your virtual machineâ€™s VZVirtioSocketDevice object.
