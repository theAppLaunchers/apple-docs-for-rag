Instance Property

# usbControllers

The list of configured USB controllers for the VM.

macOS 15.0+

``` source
var usbControllers: [VZUSBControllerConfiguration] { get set }
```

## Discussion

Use this property to attach USB controllers to the VM configuration, as in the following example:

```
// Configure and start the virtual machine.
let usbControllerConfiguration = VZXHCIControllerConfiguration()

let vmConfiguration = VZVirtualMachineConfiguration()
vmConfiguration.usbControllers = [usbControllerConfiguration]

let virtualMachine = VZVirtualMachine(configuration: vmConfiguration)
try await virtualMachine.start()
```

This property contains an empty array if the `VZVirtualMachineConfiguration` doesnâ€™t have any configured USB controllers.
