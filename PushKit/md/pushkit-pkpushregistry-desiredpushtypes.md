## Discussion

When you assign a value to this property, the push registry object makes a registration request with the PushKit server. This request is asynchronous, and the success or failure of the request is reported to your registryâ€™s delegate object. For a successful registration, PushKit delivers a push token to the delegate. Use that token to generate push requests from your server.

For a list of push types that you may include in the set, see PKPushType.
