## Discussion

You set this value and the operating system sends it back to you as:

- The `login_hint` in the call to your authorization endpoint during re-authentication

- A parameter to your marketplace extensionâ€™s additionalHeaders(for:account:) callback

The system also groups apps in restore requests based on account.
