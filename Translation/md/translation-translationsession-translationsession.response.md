# TranslationSession.Response

The response to a translation request.

``` source
struct Response

## Overview

You get a single response structure after you translate a string, or when you call one of the batch translation methods passing in an array of translation requests. When the translation completes, a response instance returns with the translation result along with properties the framework used to perform the translation.
