``` source
struct Request
```

## Overview

Create a translation request to translate a string of text. Create the request using the init(sourceText:clientIdentifier:) initializer. Set the `sourceText` to the string of text you want to translate. Then pass that request in an array to one of the batch translation functions.

Keep track of which responses correspond with which requests by setting the clientIdentifier on the request you send, then matching it against the clientIdentifier response you receive when the translation completes and returns.
