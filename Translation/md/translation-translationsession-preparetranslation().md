func prepareTranslation() async throws
```

## Discussion

If you know ahead of time which languages the user needs to translate, you can prompt them to download those languages in advance by calling this method.

When you call this method the framework asks the user for permission to download the sourceLanguage and targetLanguage. If the languages are already installed or are in the middle of downloading, the function returns without prompting the user.

If you call this function when the `sourceLanguage` is `nil`, it throws unableToIdentifyLanguage since thereâ€™s no sample text to identify which source language to use for translation.
