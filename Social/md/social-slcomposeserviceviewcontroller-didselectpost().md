## Discussion

By default, this method calls the completeRequestReturningItems: method of the associated extensionContext property, passing `nil` in the `items` array and a `nil` expiration handler. You must override `didSelectPost` to perform the post of contentText and any attachments. In your implementation of this method, you can call `super` to take advantage of the default completion handler; if you donâ€™t call `super`, you must call the completion method of the extension context.
