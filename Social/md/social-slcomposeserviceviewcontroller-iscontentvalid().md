``` source
@MainActor
func isContentValid() -> Bool
```

## Return Value

true if the current content and attachments are valid for posting, otherwise false. The default return value is true.

## Discussion

This method is automatically called after each change a user makes to the text in the compose view. You can use this method to determine whether the Post button should be enabled and to update charactersRemaining, if necessary.

A subclass should implement this method to perform custom validation of the userâ€™s content before initiating a post.
