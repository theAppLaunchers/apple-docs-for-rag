Instance Property

# contentTimeForTransition

The time within the timeline of the current player item when the content proposal presentation should begin.

tvOS 10.0+

``` source
var contentTimeForTransition: CMTime { get }
```

## Discussion

The time value commonly marks the beginning of the end credits in a television show or movie. For other content, this may be at the very end of the video. The default value, indefinite, indicates that the transition should occur at the very end of the current player itemâ€™s end time; this is equivalent to using the duration of the asset.
