Instance Property

# contextualActionsPreviewImage

An image to show alongside the contextual actions.

visionOS 1.0+

``` source
@NSCopying @MainActor
var contextualActionsPreviewImage: UIImage? { get set }
```

## Discussion

Use this to enhance a contextual action with more context. For example, if the action presents a button to jump back in time, show a preview frame of where in the movie the action skips to.

Note

The system only displays an image if the contextualActions property contains a single value.
