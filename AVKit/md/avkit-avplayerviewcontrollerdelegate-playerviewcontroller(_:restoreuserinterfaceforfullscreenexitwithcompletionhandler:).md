    _ playerViewController: AVPlayerViewController,
    restoreUserInterfaceForFullScreenExitWithCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (Bool) -> Void
)
```

The player view controller.

`completionHandler`  

The completion handler to call for the system to finish restoring your user interface. You must invoke this callback with a value of true.

## Discussion

Important

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
optional func playerViewControllerRestoreUserInterfaceForFullScreenExit(_ playerViewController: AVPlayerViewController) async -> Bool
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.
