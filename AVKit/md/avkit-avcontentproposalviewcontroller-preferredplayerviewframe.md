Presenting Content Proposals in tvOS

## Discussion

This value defaults to a rectangle that represents the entire screen bounds, but custom view controllers may return a smaller rectangle, or zero to hide the player view completely. If you return a rectangle smaller that the full-screen bounds, the player view animates its frame to its new size and position.
