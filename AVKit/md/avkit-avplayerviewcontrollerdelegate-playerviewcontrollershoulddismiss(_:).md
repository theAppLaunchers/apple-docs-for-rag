optional func playerViewControllerShouldDismiss(_ playerViewController: AVPlayerViewController) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`playerViewController`  

The player view controller.

## Return Value

true if the player view controller should dismiss itself; otherwise false.

## Discussion

If allowed, the player view controller dismisses itself with animation. If youâ€™ve embedded the player view controller in another view, the delegate may need to manually dismiss the view controller.
