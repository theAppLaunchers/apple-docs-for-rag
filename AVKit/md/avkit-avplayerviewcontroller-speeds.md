var speeds: [AVPlaybackSpeed] { get set }
```

## Discussion

By default, this property value equals systemDefaultSpeeds. Setting this property to an empty array hides the playback speed selection user interface.

To set the playback speed programmatically, call the selectSpeed(_:) method, or set the value of the defaultRate property on the view controllerâ€™s associated player object.
