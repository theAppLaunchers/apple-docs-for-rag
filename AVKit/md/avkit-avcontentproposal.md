Presenting Content Proposals in tvOS

## Overview

A content proposal object models the data about the proposed content such as its title, preview image, presentation time, and content URL. You make a content proposal eligible for presentation by setting it as the nextContentProposal of the current AVPlayerItem.

```
let proposal = AVContentProposal(contentTimeForTransition: time,
                                 title: title,
                                 previewImage: image)
// Set the proposal as the nextContentProposal of the current player item
currentPlayerItem.nextContentProposal = proposal
```
