The state of the transition provided to the delegate object.

``` source
struct TransitionContext
```

## Overview

When `AVExperienceController` transitions its `experience` from `fromExperience` to `toExperience`, delegate callbacks provide instances of `TransitionContext` to allow clients to respond as the transition progresses or reverts. The normal `Status` sequence is `.preparing` -\> `.transitioning` -\> `.completed` Once `.completed`, `AVExperienceController`â€™s `experience` is now the `toExperience`.

Not all transitions are `.completed`, instead they are `.reversed` back to the `fromExperience`. Reversed transitions can happen after `.preparing` or after `.transitioning`, but it will not happen after `.completed` or before `.preparing`. When a transition is reversed a reason is provided.

## Topics
