Instance Property

# allowedExperiences

The set of experiences the application supports.

visionOS 2.0+

``` source
@MainActor
final var allowedExperiences: AVExperienceController.Experiences { get set }
```

## Discussion

Use this to allow additional experiences like multiview, or to disable expanded. This list is the basis for availableExperiences, which filters out inapplicable experiences.

Note

Because AVExperienceController.Experience.embedded is the initial experience, and the one returned to when others end, itâ€™s a programming error to exclude it from this list.
