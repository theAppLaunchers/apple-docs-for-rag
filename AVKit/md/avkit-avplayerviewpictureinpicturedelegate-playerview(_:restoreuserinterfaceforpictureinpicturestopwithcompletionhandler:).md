## Discussion

Important

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
optional func playerViewRestoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStop(_ playerView: AVPlayerView) async -> Bool
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.
