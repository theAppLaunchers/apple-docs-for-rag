## Parameters

The `AVExperienceController`.

Contains information about the transition.

## Discussion

Implement this method to prepare the appâ€™s state for the toExperience. This may include showing or hiding view controllers, putting the player view controller in the view hierarchy, or any other asynchronous work required for the transition. This is the last chance to update configuration before the transition begins.
