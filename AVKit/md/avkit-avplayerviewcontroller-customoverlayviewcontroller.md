Instance Property

# customOverlayViewController

A view controller that presents custom content over the player view.

tvOS 13.0+

``` source
@MainActor
var customOverlayViewController: UIViewController? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The system presents the overlay view when the user swipes up on the Siri Remote during playback when the transport bar is hidden, or when they select a button when the transport bar is visible.

Important

Set a custom overlay view controller instead of installing a custom swipe gesture recognizer.
