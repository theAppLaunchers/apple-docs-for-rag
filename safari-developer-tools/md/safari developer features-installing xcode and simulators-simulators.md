# Installing Xcode and Simulators

Install simulators to use for web development.

## Overview

iOS, iPadOS, and (on a Mac with Apple silicon) visionOS simulators are available in macOS as part of Xcode, which is free in the Mac App Store.

To get started using Simulators:

1.  Install Xcode from the Mac App Store.

2.  Once installed, launch Xcode so that it can complete its first launch.

3.  A dialog will be presented that indicates which Simulator runtimes are built-in, and which Simulator runtimes you may download. For now, choose **Continue** to finish setting up Xcode.

4.  Once Xcode has finished setting up, relaunch Safari to begin using the **Open Page With \> \[Simulator\]** part of the Develop menu and **Open with Simulator** in Responsive Design Mode.
