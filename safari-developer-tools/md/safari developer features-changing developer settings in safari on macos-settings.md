# Changing Developer settings in Safari on macOS

Change developer-centric settings that change the behavior of Safari.

## Overview

Once features for web developers are shown, Safari adds a **Developer** pane to its settings, from which several behaviors can be controlled.

### Automation

Allow remote automation  
Allow Safari to be automatically controlled with WebDriver.

Allow JavaScript from Smart Search field  
Allow text starting with `javascript:` to be run on the current page when entered in the Smart Search field.

Allow JavaScript from Apple Events  
Allow JavaScript to be executed on webpages via AppleScript.

### Compatibility

Disable site-specific quirks  
On rare occasions, when a particular website does not work correctly in Safari, modifications are made in browser code to get that site to work. This setting disables such modifications to make it possible for the site’s developers to debug their problem. If there are no site-specific quirks, this setting has no effect.

### Security

Disable local file restrictions  
Disable security checks that may prohibit local development when loading content with the `file://` protocol.

Disable cross-origin restrictions  
Disable security checks that are performed when loading resources from origins other than the one from which the main page was loaded.

### Privacy

Enable Private Click Measurement debug mode  
Enables sending reports after 10 seconds, instead of 24-48 hours, after an event, as well as enabling additional logging in Web Inspector’s console. Learn more about Private Click Measurement…

### Extensions

Allow unsigned extensions  
Allow enabling unsigned extensions in the **Extensions** settings panel. Learn more about allowing unsigned extensions.
