``` source
var isCameraEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value of this property is false. Set this property to true to enable the camera. When the app runs in visionOS, the value in this property is false and assigning a new value has no effect.

You can use this property for key-value observing.

Note

In your appâ€™s `Info.plist` file, you must set the `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` key with a string that describes how your app uses the camera footage.
