```

## Discussion

When the isReachable property is false, use this property to determine if the iPhone is unreachable because it needs to be unlocked first. A recently rebooted iPhone remains unreachable until the user unlocks it for the first time. Until the user unlocks the iPhone, the value of this property is true. When the value is true, you might display an alert from your Watch app asking the user to unlock the iPhone to continue. After the user unlocks the iPhone, the value of the property changes to false.

The value in this property is valid only for a configured session that has been activated successfully. If the activationState property is available, its value must be WCSessionActivationState.activated. When the session becomes inactive or deactivated, you should ignore the value in this property.
