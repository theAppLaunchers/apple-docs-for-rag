## Overview

You do not create instances of this class yourself. When you initiate a file transfer, the system creates a new file transfer object to represent the transferred file. Use that object to get the file information or to cancel the transfer as needed.

To initiate a file transfer operation, call the transferFile(_:metadata:) method of your appâ€™s WCSession object.

## Topics

### Managing the File Transfer

var isTransferring: Bool
