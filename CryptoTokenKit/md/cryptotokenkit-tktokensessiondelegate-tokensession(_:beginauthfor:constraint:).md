``` source
optional func tokenSession(
    _ session: TKTokenSession,
    beginAuthFor operation: TKTokenOperation,
    constraint: Any
) throws -> TKTokenAuthOperation
```

## Parameters 

`session`  

The token session.

`operation`  

The kind of operation.

`constraint`  

The constraint to be satisfied.

## Return Value

The resulting context of the operation, or `nil` if an error occurred.

## Discussion

If you return an instance of a subclass of TKTokenAuthOperation that is provided by the CryptoTokenKit framework, the system will first fill in the context-specific properties, such as the password, before calling the `finishWithError:` method on the context.
