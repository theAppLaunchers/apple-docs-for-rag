## Discussion

This value is specified in the Smart Card token extensionâ€™s `NSExtensionAttributes` property list by the `com.apple.ctk.aid` attribute. If this attribute specifies multiple AIDs, this parameter represents the application identifier found on the card that is already preselected. If the `com.apple.ctk.aid` attribute is not present, no application is automatically preselected and the value of this property is `nil`.

For more information, see App Extension Keys in Information Property List Key Reference.
