``` source
class TKTokenSession
```

## Overview

A token session communicates with its delegate to perform operations with its token that are bound to the authentication state.

A session is always instantiated by a TKToken instance through the tokenâ€™s delegate when the framework detects access to the token from a new authentication session.

Important

Never share the authentication status of a token, such as the PIN entered to unlock a smart card, with other token sessions.

## Topics

### Creating Token Sessions

init(token: TKToken)

### Responding to Authentication Events

var delegate: (any TKTokenSessionDelegate)?

The token session delegate.

protocol TKTokenSessionDelegate

The interface that a session instance delegate implements to respond to token session authentication events.

### Accessing the Token

var token: TKToken
