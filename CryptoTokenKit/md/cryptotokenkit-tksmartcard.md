## Overview

This class provides an interface for managing sessions with a smart card, transmitting requests, and facilitating user interaction.

You can create a TKSmartCard object when a smart card is inserted into a slot, by calling the makeSmartCard() method on the corresponding TKSmartCardSlot object. To start communicating with the smart card, call the beginSession(reply:) method on the TKSmartCard object. Once an exclusive session has been established, you transmit data using the transmit(_:reply:) method. After youâ€™ve finished communicating with a smart card, you call the endSession() method.

If the smart card is physically removed from its slot, the session object becomes invalid, and any further calls to transmit(_:reply:) will return an error. You can use Key-Value Observing on the isValid property to be notified when a smart card is invalidated, due to being removed from the slot or another reason.

## Topics

### Configuring the Smart Card

var slot: TKSmartCardSlot

The slot in which the Smart Card is inserted.

var isValid: Bool

Whether the Smart Card is valid and accessible from its slot.

var isSensitive: Bool

Whether sessions established for the Smart Card should be considered sensitive. false by default.

var context: Any?

User-specified information. This property is automatically set to `nil` if the Smart Card is removed or another `TKSmartCard` object begins a session.

### Setting the Communication Protocol

var allowedProtocols: TKSmartCardProtocol

The protocols allowed for communication with the Smart Card. any by default.

var currentProtocol: TKSmartCardProtocol

The protocol used for communication with the Smart Card. Returns TKSmartCardProtocolNone if no session is currently established.

struct TKSmartCardProtocol

Smart Card transmission protocols.

### Communicating with the Smart Card

func beginSession(reply: (Bool, (any Error)?) -> Void)

Begins a session with the Smart Card.

func transmit(Data, reply: (Data?, (any Error)?) -> Void)

Transmits data in Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) format to the Smart Card.

func endSession()

Completes any pending transmissions and ends the session to the Smart Card.

### Managing User Interaction

func userInteractionForSecurePINVerification(TKSmartCardPINFormat, apdu: Data, pinByteOffset: Int) -> TKSmartCardUserInteractionForSecurePINVerification?

Creates and returns a new user interaction object for secure PIN verification using the Smart Card reader facilities.

func userInteractionForSecurePINChange(TKSmartCardPINFormat, apdu: Data, currentPINByteOffset: Int, newPINByteOffset: Int) -> TKSmartCardUserInteractionForSecurePINChange?

Creates a new user interaction object for secure PIN change using the smart card reader facilities (typically a HW keypad).

class TKSmartCardPINFormat

The formatting properties for a PIN, such as character encoding and length constraints.

class TKSmartCardUserInteraction

The base class for encapsulating user interaction with a Smart Card reader.

class TKSmartCardUserInteractionForPINOperation

A representation of user interaction for secure PIN operations on a Smart Card reader.

class TKSmartCardUserInteractionForSecurePINChange

A representation of the user interaction for secure PIN change operations on a Smart Card reader.

class TKSmartCardUserInteractionForSecurePINVerification

A representation of the user interaction for secure PIN change verification on a Smart Card reader.

### Configuring APDU Behavior

var cla: UInt8

The CLA byte used for APDU transmission. `0x00` by default.

var useExtendedLength: Bool

Whether to use extended length APDU.

var useCommandChaining: Bool

Whether to use command chaining of APDU with a data field longer than 255 bytes.

### Transmitting Data

func send(ins: UInt8, p1: UInt8, p2: UInt8, data: Data?, le: Int?, reply: (Data?, UInt16, (any Error)?) -> Void)

Asynchronously transmits an APDU command to the card, returning the response in a completion handler.

func send(ins: UInt8, p1: UInt8, p2: UInt8, data: Data?, le: Int?) throws -> (sw: UInt16, response: Data)

Synchronously transmits an APDU command to the card and returns the response.

func withSession&lt;T>(() throws -> T) throws -> T

Synchronously begins a session, executes the given closure, and ends the session.
