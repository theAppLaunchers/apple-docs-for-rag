## Overview

Typically, the supported algorithm for a token key can be represented by a value of the `SecKeyAlgorithm` enumeration. However, tokens such as Smart Cards require that input data for operations take the format of a more specific algorithm. For example, a token may accept raw data to generate a cryptographic signature, but require that raw data to be formatted according to PKCS1 padding rules. To express such a requirement, a `TKTokenKeyAlgorithm` object defines a target algorithm and a set of other algorithms that were used. In the previous example, the target algorithm is `kSecKeyAlgorithmRSASignatureRaw` and the `kSecKeyAlgorithmRSASignatureDigestPKCS1v15SHA1` algorithm is also reported as being used.

## Topics

### Determining Algorithm Usage

func isAlgorithm(SecKeyAlgorithm) -> Bool

Returns whether the specified algorithm is the target operation algorithm.

func supportsAlgorithm(SecKeyAlgorithm) -> Bool

Whether the specified algorithm is the target operation algorithm, or one of the other algorithms used.
