var contentViewInsets: NSDirectionalEdgeInsets { get set }

## Discussion

Use negative values for positive spacing. The top and bottom values represent the spacing between the content view and the header and footer views, respectively. The leading and trailing values represent the spacing between the content view and the lockup view. The default value is NSDirectionalEdgeInsetsZero.
