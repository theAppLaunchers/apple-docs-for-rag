## Overview

A `TVCardView` object is a specialized version of TVLockupView that presents an arbitrarily composed view hierarchy in a floating content view. You add custom subviews to the contentView property, and the subviews act as a single unit in regard to selection and motion effects. You typically use a TVCardView to display ratings and reviews for a media item. The following figure shows a rating card that consists of two label views (the rating and related information) and an image view (the stars).
