``` source
var masksToBounds: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When the value of this property is true, Core Animation creates an implicit clipping mask that matches the bounds of the layer and includes any corner radius effects. If a value for the mask property is also specified, the two masks are multiplied to get the final mask value.

The default value of this property is false.
