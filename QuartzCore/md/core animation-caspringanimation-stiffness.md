# stiffness

The spring stiffness coefficient.

var stiffness: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default stiffness coefficient is `100`. Increasing the stiffness reduces the number of oscillations and will reduce the settling duration. Decreasing the stiffness increases the the number of oscillations and will increase the settling duration.
