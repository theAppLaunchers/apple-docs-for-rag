Defines how the springâ€™s motion should be damped due to the forces of friction.

## Discussion

The default value of the damping property is `10`. Reducing this value reduces the energy loss with each oscillation: the animated value will overshoot the toValue and the settlingDuration may be greater than the duration. Increasing the value increases the energy loss with each duration: there will be fewer and smaller oscillations and the settlingDuration may be smaller than the duration.
