## Discussion

Defaults to `nil`.

Important

The `delegate` object is retained by the receiver. This is a rare exception to the memory management rules described in Advanced Memory Management Programming Guide.

An instance of `CAAnimation` should not be set as a delegate of itself. Doing so (outside of a garbage-collected environment) will cause retain cycles.
