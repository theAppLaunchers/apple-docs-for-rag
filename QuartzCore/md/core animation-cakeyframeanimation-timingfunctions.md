# timingFunctions

An optional array of `CAMediaTimingFunction` objects that define the pacing for each keyframe segment.

var timingFunctions: [CAMediaTimingFunction]? { get set }

## Discussion

You can use this array to apply ease-in, ease-out, or custom timing curves to the points that lie between two keyframe values. If the number of keyframes in the values property is *n*, then this property should contain *n*`-1` objects.

If you provide timing information in the keyTimes property, the timing functions you specify using this property further modify the timing between those values. If you do not assign a value to the keyTimes property, the timing functions modify the default timing provided by the animation object.

If you also specify a timing function in the animation objectâ€™s timingFunction property, that function is applied first followed by the timing function for the specific keyframe segment.

For information on how to create a timing function, see CAMediaTimingFunction.
