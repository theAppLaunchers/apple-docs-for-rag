Type Property

# linear

Linear pacing, which causes an animation to occur evenly over its duration.

static let linear: CAMediaTimingFunctionName
```

## Discussion

This is a BÃ©zier timing function with the control points (0.0,0.0) and (1.0,1.0).

The following code shows how to create a basic animation object using linear interpolation.

```
 let verticalAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position.y")
 verticalAnimation.fromValue = 310
 verticalAnimation.toValue = 10
 verticalAnimation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: kCAMediaTimingFunctionLinear)
```

A layer animated with the animation created by the code above and with linearly interpolated horizontal movement would describe a path similar to the following figure.

### Constants

static let easeIn: CAMediaTimingFunctionName

Ease-in pacing, which causes an animation to begin slowly and then speed up as it progresses.

static let easeOut: CAMediaTimingFunctionName

Ease-out pacing, which causes an animation to begin quickly and then slow as it progresses.

static let easeInEaseOut: CAMediaTimingFunctionName

Ease-in-ease-out pacing, which causes an animation to begin slowly, accelerate through the middle of its duration, and then slow again before completing.

static let `default`: CAMediaTimingFunctionName

The system default timing function. Use this function to ensure that the timing of your animations matches that of most system animations.
