## Discussion

By default, this property is set to the unit rectangle (0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0), which results in all of the layerâ€™s contents being drawn.

If pixels outside the unit rectangle are requested, the edge pixels of the contents image are extended outwards.

If you assign an empty rectangle to this property, the results are undefined.
