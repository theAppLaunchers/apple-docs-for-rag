Instance Property

# edgeAntialiasingMask

A bitmask defining how the edges of the receiver are rasterized.

``` source
var edgeAntialiasingMask: CAEdgeAntialiasingMask { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property specifies which edges of the layer are antialiased and is a combination of the constants defined in CAEdgeAntialiasingMask. You can enable or disable antialiasing for each edge (top, left, bottom, right) separately. By default antialiasing is enabled for all edges.

Typically, you would use this property to disable antialiasing for edges that abut edges of other layers, to eliminate the seams that would otherwise occur.
