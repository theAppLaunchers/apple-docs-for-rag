Instance Property

# mass

The mass of the object attached to the end of the spring.

``` source
var mass: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default mass is `1`. Increasing this value will increase the spring effect: the attached object will be subject to more oscillations and greater overshoot, resulting in an increased settlingDuration. Decreasing the mass will reduce the spring effect: there will be fewer oscillations and a reduced overshoot, resulting in a decreased settlingDuration.
