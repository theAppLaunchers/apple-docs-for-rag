# rasterizationScale

The scale at which to rasterize content, relative to the coordinate space of the layer. Animatable

## Discussion

When the value in the shouldRasterize property is true, the layer uses this property to determine whether to scale the rasterized content (and by how much). The default value of this property is `1.0`, which indicates that the layer should be rasterized at its current size. Larger values magnify the content and smaller values shrink it.
