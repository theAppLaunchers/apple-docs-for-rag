``` source
class CAScrollLayer
```

## Overview

The CAScrollLayer class is a subclass of CALayer that simplifies displaying a portion of a layer. The extent of the scrollable area of the CAScrollLayer is defined by the layout of its sublayers. The visible portion of the layer content is set by specifying the origin as a point or a rectangular area of the contents to be displayed. CAScrollLayer does not provide keyboard or mouse event-handling, nor does it provide visible scrollers.

## Topics

### Scrolling constraints

var scrollMode: CAScrollLayerScrollMode

Defines the axes in which the layer may be scrolled.

### Scrolling the layer

func scroll(to: CGPoint)

Changes the origin of the receiver to the specified point.

func scroll(to: CGRect)

Scroll the contents of the receiver to ensure that the rectangle is visible.
