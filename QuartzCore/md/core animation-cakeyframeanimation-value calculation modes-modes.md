### Constants

static let linear: CAAnimationCalculationMode

Simple linear calculation between keyframe values.

static let discrete: CAAnimationCalculationMode

Each keyframe value is used in turn, no interpolated values are calculated.

static let paced: CAAnimationCalculationMode

Linear keyframe values are interpolated to produce an even pace throughout the animation.

static let cubic: CAAnimationCalculationMode

Smooth spline calculation between keyframe values.

static let cubicPaced: CAAnimationCalculationMode

Cubic keyframe values are interpolated to produce an even pace throughout the animation.
