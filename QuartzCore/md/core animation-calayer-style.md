Instance Property

# style

An optional dictionary used to store property values that aren’t explicitly defined by the layer.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.5+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
var style: [AnyHashable : Any]? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This dictionary may in turn have a `style` key, forming a hierarchy of default values. In the case of hierarchical style dictionaries the shallowest value for a property is used. For example, the value for “style.someValue” takes precedence over “style.style.someValue”.

If the style dictionary does not define a value for an attribute, the receiver’s defaultValue(forKey:) method is called. The default value of this property is `nil`.

The style dictionary is not consulted for the following keys: `bounds`, `frame`.

Warning

If the style dictionary or any of its ancestors are modified, the values of the layer’s properties are undefined until the `style` property is reset.

Contents Gravity Values

The contents gravity constants specify the position of the content object when the layer bounds is larger than the bounds of the content object. They are used by the contentsGravity property.

var opacity: Float

An optional layer whose alpha channel is used to mask the layer’s content.

var isDoubleSided: Bool

A Boolean indicating whether the layer displays its content when facing away from the viewer. Animatable.

var cornerRadius: CGFloat

The radius to use when drawing rounded corners for the layer’s background. Animatable.
