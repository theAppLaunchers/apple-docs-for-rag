## Overview

Use an `SFSpeechRecognitionTask` object to determine the state of a speech recognition task, to cancel an ongoing task, or to signal the end of the task.

You donâ€™t create speech recognition task objects directly. Instead, you receive one of these objects after calling recognitionTask(with:resultHandler:) or recognitionTask(with:delegate:) on your SFSpeechRecognizer object.

## Topics

### Finishing a Speech Recognition Task

func finish()

var isFinishing: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether audio input has stopped.

### Monitoring Recognition Progress

var state: SFSpeechRecognitionTaskState

The current state of the speech recognition task.

enum SFSpeechRecognitionTaskState
