Instance Property

# requiresOnDeviceRecognition

A Boolean value that determines whether a request must keep its audio data on the device.

``` source
var requiresOnDeviceRecognition: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Set this property to true to prevent an SFSpeechRecognitionRequest from sending audio over the network. However, on-device requests wonâ€™t be as accurate.

Note

The request only honors this setting if the supportsOnDeviceRecognition (SFSpeechRecognizer) property is also true.
