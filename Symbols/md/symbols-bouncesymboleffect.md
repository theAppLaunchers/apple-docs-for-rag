## Overview

A bounce animation draws attention to a symbol by applying a brief scaling operation to the symbolâ€™s layers. You can choose to scale the symbol up or down as it bounces.

Important

Because SwiftUI is a state-driven framework, you pass a `value` parameter when adding discrete effects, like bounce. You trigger the animation by changing the `value` parameter. Because AppKit and UIKit are event-driven frameworks, discrete effects animate automatically when added to an image view.

```
// Add an effect in SwiftUI.
@State private var value1 = 0
@State private var value2 = 0
var body: some View {
    HStack {
        Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
            // Bounce with a scale-up animation.
            .symbolEffect(.bounce.up, value: value1)
            .onTapGesture {
                value1 += 1
            }
        Image(systemName: "arrow.down.circle")
            // Bounce three times with a scale-down animation.
            .symbolEffect(.bounce.down, options: .repeat(3), value: value2)
            .onTapGesture {
                value2 += 1
            }
    }
}
```

```
// Add an effect in AppKit and UIKit.
// Bounce with a scale-up animation.
imageView1.addSymbolEffect(.bounce.up)

// Bounce three times with a scale-down animation.
imageView2.addSymbolEffect(.bounce.down, options: .repeat(3))
```

## Topics

### Accessing symbol effects

var down: BounceSymbolEffect

An effect that bounces the symbol downward.

var up: BounceSymbolEffect

An effect that bounces the symbol upward.

### Determining effect scope

var byLayer: BounceSymbolEffect

An effect that bounces each layer separately.

var wholeSymbol: BounceSymbolEffect

An effect that bounces all layers simultaneously.

### Accessing the configuration

var configuration: SymbolEffectConfiguration

The configuration for the effect.
