## Overview

Important

These algorithms arenâ€™t considered cryptographically secure, but the framework provides them for backward compatibility with older services that require them. For new services, avoid these algorithms.

## Topics

### Hashes

struct MD5

An implementation of MD5 hashing.

struct SHA1

An implementation of SHA1 hashing.

### Structures

struct MD5Digest

The output of a MD5 hash.

struct SHA1Digest

The output of a SHA1 hash.
