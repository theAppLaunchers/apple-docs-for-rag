## Overview

The SHA512 hash implements the HashFunction protocol for the specific case of SHA-2 hashing with a 512-bit digest (SHA512Digest). Larger digests take more space but are more secure.

You can compute the digest by calling the static `hash(data:)` method once. Alternatively, if the data that you want to hash is too large to fit in memory, you can compute the digest iteratively by creating a new hash instance, calling the `update(data:)` method repeatedly with blocks of data, and then calling the finalize() method to get the result.

## Topics

### Specifying the output type

typealias Digest

The digest type for a SHA512 hash function.

struct SHA512Digest

The output of a Secure Hashing Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) hash with a 512-bit digest.

### Computing a hash iteratively

init()

Creates a SHA512 hash function.

func update(bufferPointer: UnsafeRawBufferPointer)

Incrementally updates the hash function with the contents of the buffer.

func finalize() -> SHA512.Digest

Finalizes the hash function and returns the computed digest.

### Inspecting hash information

static let byteCount: Int

The number of bytes in a SHA512 digest.

static let blockByteCount: Int

The number of bytes that represents the hash functionâ€™s internal state.
