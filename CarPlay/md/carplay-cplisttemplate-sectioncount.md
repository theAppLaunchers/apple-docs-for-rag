Instance Property

# sectionCount

The number of sections in the list.

iOS 14.0+iPadOS 14.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+

``` source
var sectionCount: Int { get }
```

## Discussion

This value never exceeds maximumSectionCount. If you initialize a list, or call the updateSections(_:) method, with an array larger than `maximumSectionCount`, CarPlay trims the array to an appropriate size.
