``` source
var eventStatusText: [String]? { get }
```

## Discussion

The first string should always be used to show the play period (quarter, inning, period) using as few characters as possible; e.g. “2nd” for the 2nd quarter.

The second and third strings can be used to display additional information, like “1st & 10” and “SF 15” for an American football game.

All three strings should be kept as brief as possible to ensure they display well on car screens of various sizes.
