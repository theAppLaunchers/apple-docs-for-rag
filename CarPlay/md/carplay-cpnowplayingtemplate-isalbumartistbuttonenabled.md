## Discussion

The Now Playing template displays a string above the playback control buttons that contains the album and artist names. Set this property to true to turn the string into a button that you can use to present more information about the current track. To respond to a user tapping the button, create an object that conforms to CPNowPlayingTemplateObserver and register it with the Now Playing template using the templateâ€™s add(_:) method.

The default value is false.
