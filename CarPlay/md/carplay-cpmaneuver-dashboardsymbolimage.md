``` source
var dashboardSymbolImage: UIImage? { get set }
```

## Discussion

You use a named image asset to supply variants for both dark and light interface styles, and initialize the image using init(named:). CarPlay then selects the correct image for the current interface style.

If you donâ€™t provide a dashboard symbol image, CarPlay uses symbolImage.
