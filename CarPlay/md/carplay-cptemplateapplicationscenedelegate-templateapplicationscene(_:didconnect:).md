## Parameters 

`templateApplicationScene`

`interfaceController`  

The interface controller for managing the user interface of this scene.

## Mentioned in 

Displaying Content in CarPlay

## Discussion

CarPlay calls this method when it launches your app and connects the scene. Use the interface controller to present your user interface templates. You must set the sceneâ€™s root template before returning from this method.

Important

Navigation apps must implement templateApplicationScene(_:didConnect:to:) instead so they can access the window where they draw their map content.
