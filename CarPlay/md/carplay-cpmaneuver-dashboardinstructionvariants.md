# dashboardInstructionVariants

An array of instruction variants for the CarPlay dashboard.

iOS 14.0+iPadOS 14.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+

``` source
var dashboardInstructionVariants: [String] { get set }
```

## Discussion

Localize each variant for display to the user, and make sure the array contains at least one variant. The system displays the first variant that fits into the available screen space, so arrange the variants in order from most- to least-preferred.

Note

If you provide both dashboardInstructionVariants and dashboardAttributedInstructionVariants, the system displays instructions from the attributed instruction variants array. If you donâ€™t provide dashboard variants, the system checks for attributedInstructionVariants, and then instructionVariants.
