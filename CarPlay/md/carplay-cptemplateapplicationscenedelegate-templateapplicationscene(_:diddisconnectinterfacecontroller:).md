)
```

## Parameters

The scene disconnecting from the app.

`interfaceController`  

The interface controller for managing the user interface of this scene.

CarPlay calls this method after it disconnects the scene. You can use it to perform any cleanup.

Important

CarPlay doesnâ€™t call this method for navigation apps. You must implement templateApplicationScene(_:didDisconnect:from:) instead.
