# MEMessageActionHandler

An object that performs actions on messages as the system downloads them.

macOS 12.0+

``` source
protocol MEMessageActionHandler : NSObjectProtocol
```

## Overview

As MailKit downloads messages, it invokes the decideAction(for:completionHandler:) method on your handler. You indicate the action to take for each message, such as marking it as read or unread, flagging it, or archiving it.

To indicate that your extension contains a message action handler, add `MEMessageActionHandler` to the MEExtensionCapabilities array in the extensionâ€™s `Info.plist` file:

```
NSExtensionAttributes

    MEExtensionCapabilities

        MEMessageActionHandler

```
