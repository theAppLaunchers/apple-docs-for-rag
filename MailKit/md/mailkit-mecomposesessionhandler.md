# MEComposeSessionHandler

An object that participates in the composition of mail messages, and annotates recipient tokens.

macOS 12.0+

``` source
@MainActor
protocol MEComposeSessionHandler : NSObjectProtocol
```

## Overview

When the user composes a message, MailKit requests a compose session handler object from your extension. MailKit uses this handler in the following ways:

- To inform it when the compose session begins and ends

- To add status annotations for email addresses that the user enters into the To, Cc, and Bcc fields

- To display a custom popover in the compose window

- To include custom headers in an outgoing message

- To confirm that an outgoing message is ready for delivery

Each of the items in the list above corresponds to methods that the handler implements.

To indicate that your extension contains a compose session handler, add `MEComposeSessionHandler` to the MEExtensionCapabilities array in the extensionâ€™s `Info.plist` file:

```
```
