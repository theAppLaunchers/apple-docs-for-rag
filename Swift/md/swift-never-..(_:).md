``` source
static func .. PartialRangeUpTo
```

## Parameters

## Discussion

Use the prefix half-open range operator (prefix `..` instance that includes any value less than `5.0`.

```
let upToFive = ..

You can use this type of partial range of a collection’s indices to represent the range from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the partial range’s upper bound.

```
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
print(numbers[..

Precondition

`maximum` must compare equal to itself (i.e. cannot be NaN).
