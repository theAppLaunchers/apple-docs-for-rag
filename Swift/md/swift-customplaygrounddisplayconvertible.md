## Overview

Playground logging can generate, at a minimum, a structured description of any type. If you want to provide a custom description of your type to be logged in place of the default description, conform to the `CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible` protocol.

Playground logging generates a richer, more specialized description of core types. For example, the contents of a `String` are logged, as are the components of an `NSColor` or `UIColor`. The current playground logging implementation logs specialized descriptions of at least the following types:

- `String` and `NSString`

- `Int`, `UInt`, and the other standard library integer types

- `Float` and `Double`

- `Bool`

- `Date` and `NSDate`

- `NSAttributedString`

- `NSNumber`

- `NSRange`

- `URL` and `NSURL`

- `CGPoint`, `CGSize`, and `CGRect`

- `NSColor`, `UIColor`, `CGColor`, and `CIColor`

- `NSImage`, `UIImage`, `CGImage`, and `CIImage`

- `NSBezierPath` and `UIBezierPath`

- `NSView` and `UIView`

Playground logging may also be able to support specialized descriptions of other types.

## Conforming to the CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible Protocol

To add `CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible` conformance to your custom type, implement the `playgroundDescription` property. If your implementation returns an instance of one of the types above, that type’s specialized description is used. If you return any other type, a structured description is generated.

If your type has value semantics, the `playgroundDescription` should be unaffected by subsequent mutations, if possible.

If your type’s `playgroundDescription` returns an instance which itself conforms to `CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible`, then that type’s `playgroundDescription` will be used, and so on. To prevent infinite loops, playground logging implementations can place a reasonable limit on this kind of chaining.
