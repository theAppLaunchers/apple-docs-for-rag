Instance Method

# assumingMemoryBound(to:)

Returns a typed buffer to the memory referenced by this buffer, assuming that the memory is already bound to the specified type.

``` source
func assumingMemoryBound(to: T.Type) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer where T : ~Copyable
```

## Parameters 

`to`  

The type `T` that the memory has already been bound to.

## Return Value

A typed pointer to the same memory as this raw pointer.

## Discussion

Use this method when you have a raw buffer to memory that has already been bound to the specified type. The memory starting at this pointer must be bound to the type `T`. Accessing memory through the returned pointer is undefined if the memory has not been bound to `T`. To bind memory to `T`, use `bindMemory(to:capacity:)` instead of this method.

Note

The bufferâ€™s base address must match the alignment of `T` (as reported by `MemoryLayout.alignment`). That is, `Int(bitPattern: self.baseAddress) % MemoryLayout.alignment` must equal zero.
