``` source
func remainderReportingOverflow(dividingBy other: UInt128) -> (partialValue: UInt128, overflow: Bool)
```

## Return Value

A tuple containing the result of the operation along with a Boolean value indicating whether overflow occurred. If the `overflow` component is `false`, the `partialValue` component contains the entire remainder. If the `overflow` component is `true`, an overflow occurred during division and the `partialValue` component contains either the entire remainder or, if the remainder is undefined, the dividend.

## Discussion

Dividing by zero is not an error when using this method. For a value `x`, the result of `x.remainderReportingOverflow(dividingBy: 0)` is `(x, true)`.
