``` source
func isStrictSubset(of possibleStrictSuperset: S) -> Bool where Element == S.Element, S : Sequence
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `Hashable`.

## Parameters 

`possibleStrictSuperset`  

A sequence of elements. `possibleStrictSuperset` must be finite.

## Return Value

`true` is the set is strict subset of `possibleStrictSuperset`; otherwise, `false`.

## Discussion

Set *A* is a strict subset of another set *B* if every member of *A* is also a member of *B* and *B* contains at least one element that is not a member of *A*.

```
let employees = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Chris", "Diana", "Eric"]
let attendees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Diana"]
print(attendees.isStrictSubset(of: employees))
// Prints "true"

// A set is never a strict subset of itself:
print(attendees.isStrictSubset(of: attendees))
// Prints "false"
```
