Type Method

# stride(ofValue:)

Returns the number of bytes from the start of one instance of `T` to the start of the next when stored in contiguous memory or in an `Array`.

``` source
static func stride(ofValue value: borrowing T) -> Int
```

## Parameters 

`value`  

A value representative of the type to describe.

## Return Value

The stride, in bytes, of the given valueâ€™s type.

## Discussion

This is the same as the number of bytes moved when an `UnsafePointer` instance is incremented. `T` may have a lower minimal alignment that trades runtime performance for space efficiency. The result is always positive.

When you have a type instead of an instance, use the `MemoryLayout.stride` static property instead.

```
let x: Int = 100

// Finding the stride of a value's type
let s = MemoryLayout.stride(ofValue: x)
// s == 8

// Finding the stride of a type directly
let t = MemoryLayout.stride
// t == 8
```
