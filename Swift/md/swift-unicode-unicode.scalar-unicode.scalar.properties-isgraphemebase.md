## Discussion

A grapheme base can be thought of as a space-occupying glyph above or below which other non-spacing modifying glyphs can be applied. For example, when the character `é` is represented in its decomposed form, the grapheme base is “e” (U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E) and it is followed by a single grapheme extender, U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT.

The set of scalars for which `isGraphemeBase` is `true` is disjoint by definition from the set for which `isGraphemeExtend` is `true`.

This property corresponds to the “Grapheme_Base” property in the Unicode Standard.
