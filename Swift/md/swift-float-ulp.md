## Discussion

This is the unit of the least significant digit in this valueâ€™s significand. For most numbers `x`, this is the difference between `x` and the next greater (in magnitude) representable number. There are some edge cases to be aware of:

- If `x` is not a finite number, then `x.ulp` is NaN.

- If `x` is very small in magnitude, then `x.ulp` may be a subnormal number. If a type does not support subnormals, `x.ulp` may be rounded to zero.

- `greatestFiniteMagnitude.ulp` is a finite number, even though the next greater representable value is `infinity`.

See also the `ulpOfOne` static property.
