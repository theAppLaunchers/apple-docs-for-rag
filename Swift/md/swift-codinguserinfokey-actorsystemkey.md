Type Property

# actorSystemKey

Key which is required to be set on a `Decoder`â€™s `userInfo` while attempting to `init(from:)` a `DistributedActor`. The stored value under this key must conform to `DistributedActorSystem`.

static let actorSystemKey: CodingUserInfoKey
```

## Discussion

Forgetting to set this key will result in that initializer throwing, because an actor system is required in order to call `DistributedActor/resolve(id:using:)` using it.
