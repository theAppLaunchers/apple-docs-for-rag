``` source
func contains(_ other: Range) -> Bool
```

Available when `Bound` conforms to `Comparable`.

## Parameters 

`other`  

A range to check for containment within this range.

## Return Value

`true` if `other` is empty or wholly contained within this range; otherwise, `false`.

## Discussion

The given range is contained within this range if its bounds are equal to or within the bounds of this range.

```
let range = 0..

Additionally, passing any empty range as `other` results in the value `true`, even if the empty rangeâ€™s bounds are outside the bounds of this range.

```
let emptyRange = 3..
