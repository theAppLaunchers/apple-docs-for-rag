# Concurrency

Perform asynchronous and parallel operations.

## Topics

### Essentials

Updating an app to use strict concurrency

Use this code to follow along with a guide to migrating your code to take advantage of the full concurrency protection that the Swift 6 language mode provides.

Updating an App to Use Swift Concurrency

Improve your app’s performance by refactoring your code to take advantage of asynchronous functions in Swift.

### Tasks

struct Task

A unit of asynchronous work.

struct TaskGroup

A group that contains dynamically created child tasks.

func withTaskGroup&lt;ChildTaskResult, GroupResult>(of: ChildTaskResult.Type, returning: GroupResult.Type, isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, body: (inout TaskGroup&lt;ChildTaskResult>) async -> GroupResult) async -> GroupResult

Starts a new scope that can contain a dynamic number of child tasks.

struct ThrowingTaskGroup

A group that contains throwing, dynamically created child tasks.

func withThrowingTaskGroup&lt;ChildTaskResult, GroupResult>(of: ChildTaskResult.Type, returning: GroupResult.Type, isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, body: (inout ThrowingTaskGroup&lt;ChildTaskResult, any Error>) async throws -> GroupResult) async rethrows -> GroupResult

Starts a new scope that can contain a dynamic number of throwing child tasks.

struct TaskPriority

The priority of a task.

struct DiscardingTaskGroup

A discarding group that contains dynamically created child tasks.

func withDiscardingTaskGroup&lt;GroupResult>(returning: GroupResult.Type, isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, body: (inout DiscardingTaskGroup) async -> GroupResult) async -> GroupResult

Starts a new scope that can contain a dynamic number of child tasks.

struct ThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup

A throwing discarding group that contains dynamically created child tasks.

func withThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup&lt;GroupResult>(returning: GroupResult.Type, isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, body: (inout ThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup&lt;any Error>) async throws -> GroupResult) async throws -> GroupResult

Starts a new scope that can contain a dynamic number of child tasks.

struct UnsafeCurrentTask

An unsafe reference to the current task.

### Asynchronous Sequences

protocol AsyncSequence

A type that provides asynchronous, sequential, iterated access to its elements.

struct AsyncStream

An asynchronous sequence generated from a closure that calls a continuation to produce new elements.

struct AsyncThrowingStream

An asynchronous sequence generated from an error-throwing closure that calls a continuation to produce new elements.

### Continuations

struct CheckedContinuation

A mechanism to interface between synchronous and asynchronous code, logging correctness violations.

func withCheckedContinuation&lt;T>(isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, function: String, (CheckedContinuation&lt;T, Never>) -> Void) async -> sending T

Invokes the passed in closure with a checked continuation for the current task.

func withCheckedThrowingContinuation&lt;T>(isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, function: String, (CheckedContinuation&lt;T, any Error>) -> Void) async throws -> sending T

Invokes the passed in closure with a checked continuation for the current task.

struct UnsafeContinuation

A mechanism to interface between synchronous and asynchronous code, without correctness checking.

func withUnsafeContinuation&lt;T>(isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, (UnsafeContinuation&lt;T, Never>) -> Void) async -> sending T

Invokes the passed in closure with a unsafe continuation for the current task.

typealias UnsafeThrowingContinuationDeprecated

func withUnsafeThrowingContinuation&lt;T>(isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, (UnsafeContinuation&lt;T, any Error>) -> Void) async throws -> sending T

Invokes the passed in closure with a unsafe continuation for the current task.

### Actors

protocol Sendable

A thread-safe type whose values can be shared across arbitrary concurrent contexts without introducing a risk of data races.

protocol Actor

Common protocol to which all actors conform.

typealias AnyActor

Common marker protocol providing a shared “base” for both (local) `Actor` and (potentially remote) `DistributedActor` types.

Deprecated

actor MainActor

A singleton actor whose executor is equivalent to the main dispatch queue.

protocol GlobalActor

A type that represents a globally-unique actor that can be used to isolate various declarations anywhere in the program.

typealias ConcurrentValueDeprecated

protocol UnsafeSendable

A type whose values can safely be passed across concurrency domains by copying, but which disables some safety checking at the conformance site.

Deprecated

typealias UnsafeConcurrentValueDeprecated

macro isolation&lt;T>() -> T

Produce a reference to the actor to which the enclosing code is isolated, or `nil` if the code is nonisolated.

func extractIsolation&lt;each Arg, Result>((repeat each Arg) async throws -> Result) -> (any Actor)?

### Task-Local Storage

class TaskLocal

Wrapper type that defines a task-local value key.

macro TaskLocal()

Macro that introduces a TaskLocal binding.

### Executors

protocol Executor

A service that can execute jobs.

struct ExecutorJob

A unit of schedulable work.

protocol SerialExecutor

A service that executes jobs.

protocol TaskExecutor

An executor that may be used as preferred executor by a task.

typealias PartialAsyncTaskDeprecated

struct UnownedJob

A unit of schedulable work.

struct JobPriority

The priority of this job.

struct UnownedSerialExecutor

An unowned reference to a serial executor (a `SerialExecutor` value).

struct UnownedTaskExecutor

var globalConcurrentExecutor: any TaskExecutor

The global concurrent executor that is used by default for Swift Concurrency tasks.

func withTaskExecutorPreference&lt;T, Failure>((any TaskExecutor)?, isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, operation: () async throws(Failure) -> T) async throws(Failure) -> T

Configure the current task hierarchy’s task executor preference to the passed TaskExecutor, and execute the passed in closure by immediately hopping to that executor.

### Deprecated

struct Job

Deprecated equivalent of ExecutorJob.

Deprecated

Key-Path Expressions

Use key-path expressions to access properties dynamically.

Manual Memory Management
