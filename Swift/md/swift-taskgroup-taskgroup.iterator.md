A type that provides an iteration interface over the results of tasks added to the group.

``` source
struct Iterator
```

Available when `ChildTaskResult` conforms to `Sendable`.

## Overview

The elements returned by this iterator appear in the order that the tasks *completed*, not in the order that those tasks were added to the task group.

This iterator terminates after all tasks have completed. After iterating over the results of each task, itâ€™s valid to make a new iterator for the task group, which you can use to iterate over the results of new tasks you add to the group. For example:

```
group.addTask { 1 }
for await r in group { print(r) }

// Add a new child task and iterate again.
group.addTask { 2 }
for await r in group { print(r) }
```
