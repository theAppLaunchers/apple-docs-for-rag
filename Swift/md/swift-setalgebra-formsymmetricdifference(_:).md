``` source
mutating func formSymmetricDifference(_ other: Self)
```

**Required** Default implementation provided.

## Parameters 

`other`  

A set of the same type.

## Discussion

In the following example, the elements of the `employees` set that are also members of `neighbors` are removed from `employees`, while the elements of `neighbors` that are not members of `employees` are added to `employees`. In particular, the names `"Bethany"` and `"Eric"` are removed from `employees` while the name `"Forlani"` is added.

```
var employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Diana", "Eric"]
let neighbors: Set = ["Bethany", "Eric", "Forlani"]
employees.formSymmetricDifference(neighbors)
print(employees)
// Prints "["Diana", "Forlani", "Alicia"]"
```
