@freestanding(expression)
macro file() -> T where T : ExpressibleByStringLiteral
```

## Overview

The string value from `#file` depends on the language version, to enable migration from the old `#filePath` behavior to the new `#fileID` behavior. Currently, `#file` has the same value as `#filePath`. In a future version of Swift, `#file` will have the same value as `#fileID` instead. To adopt the future behavior, replace `#file` with `#fileID` or `#filePath` as appropriate.

This macroâ€™s value can be changed by `#sourceLocation`, as described in Line Control Statement in *The Swift Programming Language*.
