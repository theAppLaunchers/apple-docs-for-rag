Structure

# DropFirstSequence

A sequence that lazily consumes and drops `n` elements from an underlying `Base` iterator before possibly returning the first available element.

``` source
@frozen
struct DropFirstSequence where Base : Sequence
```

## Overview

The underlying iteratorâ€™s sequence may be infinite.

## Topics

### Initializers

init(Base, dropping: Int)

### Instance Methods

func dropFirst(Int) -> DropFirstSequence&lt;Base>

### Type Aliases

typealias SubSequence

### Default Implementations

Sequence Implementations

## Relationships

### Conforms To

- Copyable

  Conforms when `Base` conforms to `Sequence`.

- Sendable

  Conforms when `Base` conforms to `Sendable` and `Sequence`.

- Sequence

  Conforms when `Base` conforms to `Sequence`.
