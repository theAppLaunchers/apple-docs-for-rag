mutating func next(isolation: isolated (any Actor)? = #isolation) async -> ChildTaskResult?
```

## Return Value

The value returned by the next child task that completes.

## Discussion

The values returned by successive calls to this method appear in the order that the tasks *completed*, not in the order that those tasks were added to the task group. For example:

```
group.addTask { 1 }
group.addTask { 2 }

print(await group.next())
// Prints either "2" or "1".
```

If there aren’t any pending tasks in the task group, this method returns `nil`, which lets you write the following to wait for a single task to complete:

```
if let first = try await group.next() {
   return first
}
```

It also lets you write code like the following to wait for all the child tasks to complete, collecting the values they returned:

```
while let value = try await group.next() {
   collected += value
}
return collected
```

Awaiting on an empty group immediate returns `nil` without suspending.

You can also use a `for`-`await`-`in` loop to collect results of a task group:

```
for await try value in group {
    collected += value
}
```

Don’t call this method from outside the task where you created this task group. In most cases, the Swift type system prevents this mistake. For example, because the `add(priority:operation:)` method is mutating, that method can’t be called from a concurrent execution context like a child task.
