Function

# withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:\_:)

Calls the given closure with a mutable pointer to the given argument.

``` source
func withUnsafeMutablePointer(
    to value: inout T,
    _ body: (UnsafeMutablePointer) throws(E) -> Result
) throws(E) -> Result where E : Error, T : ~Copyable, Result : ~Copyable
```

## Parameters 

`value`  

An instance to temporarily use via pointer. Note that the `inout` exclusivity rules mean that, like any other `inout` argument, `value` cannot be directly accessed by other code for the duration of `body`. Access must only occur through the pointer argument to `body` until `body` returns.

`body`  

A closure that takes a mutable pointer to `value` as its sole argument. If the closure has a return value, that value is also used as the return value of the `withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)` function. The pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the functionâ€™s execution.

## Return Value

The return value, if any, of the `body` closure.

## Discussion

The `withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)` function is useful for calling Objective-C APIs that take in/out parameters (and default-constructible out parameters) by pointer.

The pointer argument to `body` is valid only during the execution of `withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)`. Do not store or return the pointer for later use.
