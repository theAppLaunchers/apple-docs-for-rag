Instance Method

# withUnsafeMutableBytes(\_:)

Calls the given closure with a pointer to the underlying bytes of the array’s mutable contiguous storage.

``` source
mutating func withUnsafeMutableBytes(_ body: (UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer) throws -> R) rethrows -> R
```

## Parameters 

`body`  

A closure with an `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` parameter that points to the contiguous storage for the array. If no such storage exists, it is created. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withUnsafeMutableBytes(_:)` method. The argument is valid only for the duration of the closure’s execution.

## Return Value

The return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.

## Discussion

The array’s `Element` type must be a *trivial type*, which can be copied with just a bit-for-bit copy without any indirection or reference-counting operations. Generally, native Swift types that do not contain strong or weak references are trivial, as are imported C structs and enums.

The following example copies bytes from the `byteValues` array into `numbers`, an array of `Int32`:

```
var numbers: [Int32] = [0, 0]
var byteValues: [UInt8] = [0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]

numbers.withUnsafeMutableBytes { destBytes in
    byteValues.withUnsafeBytes { srcBytes in
        destBytes.copyBytes(from: srcBytes)
    }
}
// numbers == [1, 2]
```

Note

This example shows the behavior on a little-endian platform.

The pointer passed as an argument to `body` is valid only for the lifetime of the closure. Do not escape it from the closure for later use.

Warning

Do not rely on anything about the array that is the target of this method during execution of the `body` closure; it might not appear to have its correct value. Instead, use only the `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` argument to `body`.
