Returns a new set with the elements that are either in this set or in the given sequence, but not in both.

``` source
func symmetricDifference(_ other: S) -> Set where Element == S.Element, S : Sequence
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `Hashable`.

## Parameters 

`other`  

A sequence of elements. `other` must be finite.

## Return Value

A new set.

## Discussion

In the following example, the `eitherNeighborsOrEmployees` set is made up of the elements of the `employees` and `neighbors` sets that are not in both `employees` *and* `neighbors`. In particular, the names `"Bethany"` and `"Eric"` do not appear in `eitherNeighborsOrEmployees`.

```
let employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Diana", "Eric"]
let neighbors = ["Bethany", "Eric", "Forlani"]
let eitherNeighborsOrEmployees = employees.symmetricDifference(neighbors)
print(eitherNeighborsOrEmployees)
// Prints "["Diana", "Forlani", "Alicia"]"
```
