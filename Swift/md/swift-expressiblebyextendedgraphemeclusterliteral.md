``` source
protocol ExpressibleByExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral : ExpressibleByUnicodeScalarLiteral
```

## Overview

An *extended grapheme cluster* is a group of one or more Unicode scalar values that approximates a single user-perceived character. Many individual characters, such as ‚Äú√©‚Äù, ‚ÄúÍπÄ‚Äù, and ‚ÄúüáÆüá≥‚Äù, can be made up of multiple Unicode scalar values. These code points are combined by Unicode‚Äôs boundary algorithms into extended grapheme clusters.

The `String`, `StaticString`, and `Character` types conform to the `ExpressibleByExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral` protocol. You can initialize a variable or constant of any of these types using a string literal that holds a single character.

```
let snowflake: Character = "‚ùÑÔ∏é"
print(snowflake)
// Prints "‚ùÑÔ∏é"
```

# Conforming to ExpressibleByExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral

To add `ExpressibleByExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral` conformance to your custom type, implement the required initializer.
