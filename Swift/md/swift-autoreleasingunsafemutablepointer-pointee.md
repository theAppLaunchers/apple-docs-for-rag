## Discussion

`AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer` is assumed to reference a value with `__autoreleasing` ownership semantics, like `NSFoo **` declarations in ARC. Setting the pointee autoreleases the new value before trivially storing it in the referenced memory.

Precondition

The pointee has been initialized with an instance of type `Pointee`.
