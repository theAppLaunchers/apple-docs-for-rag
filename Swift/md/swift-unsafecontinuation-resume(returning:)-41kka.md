``` source
func resume(returning value: sending T) where E == Never
```

## Parameters 

`value`  

The value to return from the continuation.

## Discussion

A continuation must be resumed exactly once. If the continuation has already resumed, then calling this method results in undefined behavior.

After calling this method, control immediately returns to the caller. The task continues executing when its executor schedules it.
