Instance Method

# reduce(\_:\_:)

Returns the result of combining the elements of the asynchronous sequence using the given closure.

``` source
func reduce(
    _ initialResult: Result,
    _ nextPartialResult: (Result, Self.Element) async throws -> Result
) async rethrows -> Result
```

## Parameters 

`initialResult`  

The value to use as the initial accumulating value. The `nextPartialResult` closure receives `initialResult` the first time the closure runs.

`nextPartialResult`  

A closure that combines an accumulating value and an element of the asynchronous sequence into a new accumulating value, for use in the next call of the `nextPartialResult` closure or returned to the caller.

## Return Value

The final accumulated value. If the sequence has no elements, the result is `initialResult`.

## Discussion

Use the `reduce(_:_:)` method to produce a single value from the elements of an entire sequence. For example, you can use this method on an sequence of numbers to find their sum or product.

The `nextPartialResult` closure executes sequentially with an accumulating value initialized to `initialResult` and each element of the sequence.

In this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `4`. The `reduce(_:_:)` method sums the values received from the asynchronous sequence.

```
let sum = await Counter(howHigh: 4)
    .reduce(0) {
        $0 + $1
    }
print(sum)
// Prints "10"
```
