``` source
mutating func formSymmetricDifference(_ other: Set)
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `Hashable`.

## Parameters 

`other`  

Another set.

## Discussion

In the following example, the elements of the `employees` set that are also members of `neighbors` are removed from `employees`, while the elements of `neighbors` that are not members of `employees` are added to `employees`. In particular, the names `"Alicia"`, `"Chris"`, and `"Diana"` are removed from `employees` while the names `"Forlani"` and `"Greta"` are added.

```
var employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Chris", "Diana", "Eric"]
let neighbors: Set = ["Bethany", "Eric", "Forlani", "Greta"]
employees.formSymmetricDifference(neighbors)
print(employees)
// Prints "["Diana", "Chris", "Forlani", "Alicia", "Greta"]"
```
