``` source
static func (lhs: Self, rhs: RHS) -> Self where RHS : BinaryInteger
```

## Parameters 

`lhs`  

The value to shift.

`rhs`  

The number of bits to shift `lhs` to the left.

## Discussion

The `

```
let x: UInt8 = 30                 // 0b00011110
let y = x 

If you use `11` as `rhs`, `x` is overshifted such that all of its bits are set to zero.

```
let z = x 

Using a negative value as `rhs` is the same as performing a right shift with `abs(rhs)`.

```
let a = x > 3
// b == 3                         // 0b00000011
```
