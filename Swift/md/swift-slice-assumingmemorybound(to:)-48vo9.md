``` source
func assumingMemoryBound(to type: T.Type) -> UnsafeBufferPointer
```

Available when `Base` is `UnsafeRawBufferPointer`.

## Return Value

A typed pointer to the same memory as this raw pointer.

## Discussion

Use this method when you have a raw buffer to memory that has already been bound to the specified type. The memory starting at this pointer must be bound to the type `T`. Accessing memory through the returned pointer is undefined if the memory has not been bound to `T`. To bind memory to `T`, use `bindMemory(to:capacity:)` instead of this method.

Note

The buffer sliceâ€™s start address must match the alignment of `T` (as reported by `MemoryLayout.alignment`). That is, `Int(bitPattern: base.baseAddress+startIndex) % MemoryLayout.alignment` must equal zero.
