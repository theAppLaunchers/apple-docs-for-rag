``` source
init(minimumCapacity: Int)
```

## Parameters 

`minimumCapacity`  

The minimum number of key-value pairs that the newly created dictionary should be able to store without reallocating its storage buffer.

## Discussion

Use this initializer to avoid intermediate reallocations of a dictionaryâ€™s storage buffer when you know how many key-value pairs you are adding to a dictionary after creation.
