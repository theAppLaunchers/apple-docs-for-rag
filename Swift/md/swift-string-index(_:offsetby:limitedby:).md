Instance Method

# index(\_:offsetBy:limitedBy:)

Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.

``` source
func index(
    _ i: String.Index,
    offsetBy distance: Int,
    limitedBy limit: String.Index
) -> String.Index?
```

## Parameters 

`i`  

A valid index of the collection.

`distance`  

The distance to offset `i`.

`limit`  

A valid index of the collection to use as a limit. If `distance > 0`, a limit that is less than `i` has no effect. Likewise, if `distance 

## Return Value

An index offset by `distance` from the index `i`, unless that index would be beyond `limit` in the direction of movement. In that case, the method returns `nil`.

## Discussion

The following example obtains an index advanced four positions from a string’s starting index and then prints the character at that position. The operation doesn’t require going beyond the limiting `s.endIndex` value, so it succeeds.

```
let s = "Swift"
if let i = s.index(s.startIndex, offsetBy: 4, limitedBy: s.endIndex) {
    print(s[i])
}
// Prints "t"
```

The next example attempts to retrieve an index six positions from `s.startIndex` but fails, because that distance is beyond the index passed as `limit`.

```
let j = s.index(s.startIndex, offsetBy: 6, limitedBy: s.endIndex)
print(j)
// Prints "nil"
```

The value passed as `distance` must not offset `i` beyond the bounds of the collection, unless the index passed as `limit` prevents offsetting beyond those bounds.

Complexity

O(*n*), where *n* is the absolute value of `distance`.
