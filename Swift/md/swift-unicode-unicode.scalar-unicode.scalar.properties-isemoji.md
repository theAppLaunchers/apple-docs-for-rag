## Discussion

This property is true for scalars that are rendered as emoji by default and also for scalars that have a non-default emoji rendering when followed by U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16. This includes some scalars that are not typically considered to be emoji:

```
let scalars: [Unicode.Scalar] = ["üòé", "$", "0"]
for s in scalars {
    print(s, "-->", s.properties.isEmoji)
}
// üòé --> true
// $ --> false
// 0 --> true
```

The final result is true because the ASCII digits have non-default emoji presentations; some platforms render these with an alternate appearance.

Because of this behavior, testing `isEmoji` alone on a single scalar is insufficient to determine if a unit of text is rendered as an emoji; a correct test requires inspecting multiple scalars in a `Character`. In addition to checking whether the base scalar has `isEmoji == true`, you must also check its default presentation (see `isEmojiPresentation`) and determine whether it is followed by a variation selector that would modify the presentation.

This property corresponds to the ‚ÄúEmoji‚Äù property in the Unicode Standard.
