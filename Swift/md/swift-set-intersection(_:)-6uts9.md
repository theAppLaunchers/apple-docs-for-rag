Instance Method

# intersection(\_:)

Returns a new set with the elements that are common to both this set and the given sequence.

``` source
func intersection(_ other: S) -> Set where Element == S.Element, S : Sequence
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `Hashable`.

## Parameters 

`other`  

A sequence of elements. `other` must be finite.

## Return Value

A new set.

## Discussion

In the following example, the `bothNeighborsAndEmployees` set is made up of the elements that are in *both* the `employees` and `neighbors` sets. Elements that are in only one or the other are left out of the result of the intersection.

```
let employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Chris", "Diana", "Eric"]
let neighbors = ["Bethany", "Eric", "Forlani", "Greta"]
let bothNeighborsAndEmployees = employees.intersection(neighbors)
print(bothNeighborsAndEmployees)
// Prints "["Bethany", "Eric"]"
```
