``` source
func withCString(_ body: (UnsafePointer) throws -> Result) rethrows -> Result
```

## Parameters 

`body`  

A closure with a pointer parameter that points to a null-terminated sequence of UTF-8 code units. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withCString(_:)` method. The pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the methodâ€™s execution.

## Return Value

The return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.

## Discussion

The pointer passed as an argument to `body` is valid only during the execution of `withCString(_:)`. Do not store or return the pointer for later use.
