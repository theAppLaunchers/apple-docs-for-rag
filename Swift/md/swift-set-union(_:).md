``` source
func union(_ other: S) -> Set where Element == S.Element, S : Sequence
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `Hashable`.

## Parameters 

`other`  

A sequence of elements. `other` must be finite.

## Return Value

A new set with the unique elements of this set and `other`.

## Discussion

In the following example, the `attendeesAndVisitors` set is made up of the elements of the `attendees` set and the `visitors` array:

```
let attendees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Diana"]
let visitors = ["Marcia", "Nathaniel"]
let attendeesAndVisitors = attendees.union(visitors)
print(attendeesAndVisitors)
// Prints "["Diana", "Nathaniel", "Bethany", "Alicia", "Marcia"]"
```

If the set already contains one or more elements that are also in `other`, the existing members are kept. If `other` contains multiple instances of equivalent elements, only the first instance is kept.

```
let initialIndices = Set(0..
