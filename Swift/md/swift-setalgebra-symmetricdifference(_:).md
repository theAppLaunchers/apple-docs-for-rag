``` source
func symmetricDifference(_ other: Self) -> Self
```

**Required** Default implementation provided.

## Parameters 

`other`  

A set of the same type as the current set.

## Return Value

A new set.

## Discussion

In the following example, the `eitherNeighborsOrEmployees` set is made up of the elements of the `employees` and `neighbors` sets that are not in both `employees` *and* `neighbors`. In particular, the names `"Bethany"` and `"Eric"` do not appear in `eitherNeighborsOrEmployees`.

```
let employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Diana", "Eric"]
let neighbors: Set = ["Bethany", "Eric", "Forlani"]
let eitherNeighborsOrEmployees = employees.symmetricDifference(neighbors)
print(eitherNeighborsOrEmployees)
// Prints "["Diana", "Forlani", "Alicia"]"
```
