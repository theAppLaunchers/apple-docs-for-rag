# Manual Memory Management

Allocate and manage memory manually.

## Topics

### First Steps

Calling Functions With Pointer Parameters

Use implicit pointer casting or bridging when calling functions that takes pointers as parameters.

### Typed Pointers

Use typed pointers and buffers to access memory as instances of a specific type.

struct UnsafePointer

A pointer for accessing data of a specific type.

struct UnsafeMutablePointer

A pointer for accessing and manipulating data of a specific type.

struct UnsafeBufferPointer

A nonowning collection interface to a buffer of elements stored contiguously in memory.

struct UnsafeMutableBufferPointer

A nonowning collection interface to a buffer of mutable elements stored contiguously in memory.

### Raw Pointers

Use raw pointers and buffers to access memory for loading and storing as raw bytes.

struct UnsafeRawPointer

A raw pointer for accessing untyped data.

struct UnsafeMutableRawPointer

A raw pointer for accessing and manipulating untyped data.

struct UnsafeRawBufferPointer

A nonowning collection interface to the bytes in a region of memory.

struct UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer

A mutable nonowning collection interface to the bytes in a region of memory.

### Memory Access

func withUnsafePointer&lt;T, E, Result>(to: inout T, (UnsafePointer&lt;T>) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result

Invokes the given closure with a pointer to the given argument.

func withUnsafePointer&lt;T, E, Result>(to: borrowing T, (UnsafePointer&lt;T>) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result

Invokes the given closure with a pointer to the given argument.

func withUnsafeMutablePointer&lt;T, E, Result>(to: inout T, (UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;T>) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result

Calls the given closure with a mutable pointer to the given argument.

func withUnsafeBytes&lt;T, E, Result>(of: inout T, (UnsafeRawBufferPointer) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result

Invokes the given closure with a buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.

func withUnsafeBytes&lt;T, E, Result>(of: borrowing T, (UnsafeRawBufferPointer) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result

Invokes the given closure with a buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.

func withUnsafeMutableBytes&lt;T, E, Result>(of: inout T, (UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result

Invokes the given closure with a mutable buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.

func withUnsafeTemporaryAllocation&lt;T, R>(of: T.Type, capacity: Int, (UnsafeMutableBufferPointer&lt;T>) throws -> R) rethrows -> R

Provides scoped access to a buffer pointer to memory of the specified type and with the specified capacity.

func withUnsafeTemporaryAllocation&lt;R>(byteCount: Int, alignment: Int, (UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer) throws -> R) rethrows -> R

Provides scoped access to a raw buffer pointer with the specified byte count and alignment.

func swap&lt;T>(inout T, inout T)

Exchanges the values of the two arguments.

func exchange&lt;T>(inout T, with: consuming T) -> T

Replaces the value of a mutable value with the supplied new value, returning the original.

### Memory Layout

enum MemoryLayout

The memory layout of a type, describing its size, stride, and alignment.

### Reference Counting

struct Unmanaged

A type for propagating an unmanaged object reference.

func withExtendedLifetime&lt;T, E, Result>(borrowing T, (borrowing T) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result

Evaluates a closure while ensuring that the given instance is not destroyed before the closure returns.

func withExtendedLifetime&lt;T, E, Result>(borrowing T, () throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result

Evaluates a closure while ensuring that the given instance is not destroyed before the closure returns.
