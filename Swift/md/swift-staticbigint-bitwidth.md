## Discussion

The following examples show the least significant byte of each value’s binary representation, separated (by an underscore) into excluded and included bits. Negative values are in two’s complement.

- `-4` (`0b11111_100`) is 3 bits.

- `-3` (`0b11111_101`) is 3 bits.

- `-2` (`0b111111_10`) is 2 bits.

- `-1` (`0b1111111_1`) is 1 bit.

- `+0` (`0b0000000_0`) is 1 bit.

- `+1` (`0b000000_01`) is 2 bits.

- `+2` (`0b00000_010`) is 3 bits.

- `+3` (`0b00000_011`) is 3 bits.
