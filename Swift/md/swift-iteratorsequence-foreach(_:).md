``` source
func forEach(_ body: (Self.Element) throws -> Void) rethrows
```

## Parameters 

`body`  

A closure that takes an element of the sequence as a parameter.

## Discussion

The two loops in the following example produce the same output:

```
let numberWords = ["one", "two", "three"]
for word in numberWords {
    print(word)
}
// Prints "one"
// Prints "two"
// Prints "three"

numberWords.forEach { word in
    print(word)
}
// Same as above
```

Using the `forEach` method is distinct from a `for`-`in` loop in two important ways:

1.  You cannot use a `break` or `continue` statement to exit the current call of the `body` closure or skip subsequent calls.

2.  Using the `return` statement in the `body` closure will exit only from the current call to `body`, not from any outer scope, and wonâ€™t skip subsequent calls.
