Initializer

# init(\_:)

Creates a new instance from the given integer.

iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
init(_ source: T) where T : BinaryInteger
```

Available when `Self` conforms to `FixedWidthInteger`.

## Parameters 

`source`  

A value to convert to this type of integer. The value passed as `source` must be representable in this type.

## Discussion

Use this initializer to convert from another integer type when you know the value is within the bounds of this type. Passing a value that canâ€™t be represented in this type results in a runtime error.

In the following example, the constant `y` is successfully created from `x`, an `Int` instance with a value of `100`. Because the `Int8` type can represent `127` at maximum, the attempt to create `z` with a value of `1000` results in a runtime error.

```
let x = 100
let y = Int8(x)
// y == 100
let z = Int8(x * 10)
// Error: Not enough bits to represent the given value
```
