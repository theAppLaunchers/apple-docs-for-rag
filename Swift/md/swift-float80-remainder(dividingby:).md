Instance Method

# remainder(dividingBy:)

Returns the remainder of this value divided by the given value.

macOS 10.10+

``` source
func remainder(dividingBy other: Self) -> Self
```

## Parameters 

`other`  

The value to use when dividing this value.

## Return Value

The remainder of this value divided by `other`.

## Discussion

For two finite values `x` and `y`, the remainder `r` of dividing `x` by `y` satisfies `x == y * q + r`, where `q` is the integer nearest to `x / y`. If `x / y` is exactly halfway between two integers, `q` is chosen to be even. Note that `q` is *not* `x / y` computed in floating-point arithmetic, and that `q` may not be representable in any available integer type.

The following example calculates the remainder of dividing 8.625 by 0.75:

```
let x = 8.625
print(x / 0.75)
// Prints "11.5"

let q = (x / 0.75).rounded(.toNearestOrEven)
// q == 12.0
let r = x.remainder(dividingBy: 0.75)
// r == -0.375

let x1 = 0.75 * q + r
// x1 == 8.625
```

If this value and `other` are finite numbers, the remainder is in the closed range `-abs(other / 2)...abs(other / 2)`. The `remainder(dividingBy:)` method is always exact. This method implements the remainder operation defined by the IEEE 754 specification.
