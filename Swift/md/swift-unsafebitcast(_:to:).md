## Discussion

Use this function only to convert the instance passed as `x` to a layout-compatible type when conversion through other means is not possible. Common conversions supported by the Swift standard library include the following:

- Value conversion from one integer type to another. Use the destination type’s initializer or the `numericCast(_:)` function.

- Bitwise conversion from one integer type to another. Use the destination type’s `init(truncatingIfNeeded:)` or `init(bitPattern:)` initializer.

- Conversion from a pointer to an integer value with the bit pattern of the pointer’s address in memory, or vice versa. Use the `init(bitPattern:)` initializer for the destination type.

- Casting an instance of a reference type. Use the casting operators (`as`, `as!`, or `as?`) or the `unsafeDowncast(_:to:)` function. Do not use `unsafeBitCast(_:to:)` with class or pointer types; doing so may introduce undefined behavior.

Warning: Calling this function breaks the guarantees of the Swift type system; use with extreme care.

Warning: Casting from an integer or a pointer type to a reference type is undefined behavior. It may result in incorrect code in any future compiler release. To convert a bit pattern to a reference type:

1.  convert the bit pattern to an UnsafeRawPointer.

2.  create an unmanaged reference using Unmanaged.fromOpaque()

3.  obtain a managed reference using Unmanaged.takeUnretainedValue() The programmer must ensure that the resulting reference has already been manually retained.

Parameters:

- x: The instance to cast to `type`.

- type: The type to cast `x` to. `type` and the type of `x` must have the same size of memory representation and compatible memory layout. Returns: A new instance of type `U`, cast from `x`.
