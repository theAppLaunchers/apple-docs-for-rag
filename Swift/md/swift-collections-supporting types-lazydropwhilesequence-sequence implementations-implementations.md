# Sequence Implementations

## Topics

### Structures

struct Iterator

An iterator over the elements traversed by a base iterator that follow the initial consecutive elements that satisfy a given predicate.

### Instance Properties

var underestimatedCount: Int

A value less than or equal to the number of elements in the sequence, calculated nondestructively.

### Instance Methods

func allSatisfy((Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of a sequence satisfies a given predicate.

func compactMap&lt;ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]

Returns an array containing the non-`nil` results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.

func contains(Self.Element) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains the given element.

func contains(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.

func count&lt;E>(where: (Self.Element) throws(E) -> Bool) throws(E) -> Int

Returns the number of elements in the sequence that satisfy the given predicate.

Returns a sequence containing all but the given number of initial elements.

func dropLast(Int) -> [Self.Element]

Returns a sequence containing all but the given number of final elements.

func elementsEqual&lt;OtherSequence>(OtherSequence) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.

func elementsEqual&lt;OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, OtherSequence.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.

func enumerated() -> EnumeratedSequence&lt;Self>

Returns a sequence of pairs (*n*, *x*), where *n* represents a consecutive integer starting at zero and *x* represents an element of the sequence.

func first(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?

Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.

func flatMap&lt;ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]

func flatMap&lt;SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> SegmentOfResult) rethrows -> [SegmentOfResult.Element]

Returns an array containing the concatenated results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.

func forEach((Self.Element) throws -> Void) rethrows

Calls the given closure on each element in the sequence in the same order as a `for`-`in` loop.

func joined() -> FlattenSequence&lt;Self>

Returns the elements of this sequence of sequences, concatenated.

func joined(separator: String) -> String

Returns a new string by concatenating the elements of the sequence, adding the given separator between each element.

func joined&lt;Separator>(separator: Separator) -> JoinedSequence&lt;Self>

Returns the concatenated elements of this sequence of sequences, inserting the given separator between each element.

func lexicographicallyPrecedes&lt;OtherSequence>(OtherSequence) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the less-than operator (`

func lexicographicallyPrecedes&lt;OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.

func makeIterator() -> LazyDropWhileSequence&lt;Base>.Iterator

Returns an iterator over the elements of this sequence.

func map&lt;T, E>((Self.Element) throws(E) -> T) throws(E) -> [T]

Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence’s elements.

func max() -> Self.Element?

Returns the maximum element in the sequence.

func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?

Returns the maximum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.

func min() -> Self.Element?

Returns the minimum element in the sequence.

func min(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
