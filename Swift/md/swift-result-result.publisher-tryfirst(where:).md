``` source
func tryFirst(where predicate: @escaping (Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryFirstWhere
```

## Parameters 

`predicate`  

A closure that takes an element as a parameter and returns a Boolean value that indicates whether to publish the element.

## Return Value

A publisher that only publishes the first element of a stream that satisfies the predicate.

## Discussion

Use tryFirst(where:) when you need to republish only the first element of a stream that satisfies an error-throwing closure you specify. The publisher ignores all elements after the first. If this publisher doesnâ€™t receive any elements, it finishes without publishing. If the predicate closure throws an error, the publisher fails.

In the example below, a range publisher emits the first element in the range then finishes normally:

```
let numberRange: ClosedRange = (-1...50)
numberRange.publisher
    .tryFirst {
        guard $0  = (100...200), the tryFirst operator would terminate publishing with a RangeError.
```
