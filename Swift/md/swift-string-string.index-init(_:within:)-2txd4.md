``` source
init?(
    _ idx: String.Index,
    within target: String.UTF16View
)
```

## Parameters 

`idx`  

A position in at least one of the views of the string shared by `target`.

`target`  

The `UTF16View` in which to find the new position.

## Discussion

If the index passed as `sourcePosition` represents either the start of a Unicode scalar value or the position of a UTF-16 trailing surrogate, then the initializer succeeds. If `sourcePosition` does not have an exact corresponding position in `target`, then the result is `nil`. For example, an attempt to convert the position of a UTF-8 continuation byte results in `nil`.

The following example finds the position of a space in a string and then converts that position to an index in the string‚Äôs `utf16` view.

```
let cafe = "Caf√© üçµ"

let stringIndex = cafe.firstIndex(of: "√©")!
let utf16Index = String.Index(stringIndex, within: cafe.utf16)!

print(String(cafe.utf16[...utf16Index])!)
// Prints "Caf√©"
```
