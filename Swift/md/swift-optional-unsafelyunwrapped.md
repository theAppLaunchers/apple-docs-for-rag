## Discussion

The `unsafelyUnwrapped` property provides the same value as the forced unwrap operator (postfix `!`). However, in optimized builds (`-O`), no check is performed to ensure that the current instance actually has a value. Accessing this property in the case of a `nil` value is a serious programming error and could lead to undefined behavior or a runtime error.

In debug builds (`-Onone`), the `unsafelyUnwrapped` property has the same behavior as using the postfix `!` operator and triggers a runtime error if the instance is `nil`.

The `unsafelyUnwrapped` property is recommended over calling the `unsafeBitCast(_:)` function because the property is more restrictive and because accessing the property still performs checking in debug builds.

Warning

This property trades safety for performance. Use `unsafelyUnwrapped` only when you are confident that this instance will never be equal to `nil` and only after youâ€™ve tried using the postfix `!` operator.
