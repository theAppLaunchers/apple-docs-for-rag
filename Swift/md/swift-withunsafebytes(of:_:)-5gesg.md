Function

# withUnsafeBytes(of:\_:)

Invokes the given closure with a buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.

``` source
func withUnsafeBytes(
    of value: borrowing T,
    _ body: (UnsafeRawBufferPointer) throws(E) -> Result
) throws(E) -> Result where E : Error, T : ~Copyable, Result : ~Copyable
```

## Parameters 

`value`  

An instance to temporarily access through a raw buffer pointer.

`body`  

A closure that takes a raw buffer pointer to the bytes of `value` as its sole argument. If the closure has a return value, that value is also used as the return value of the `withUnsafeBytes(of:_:)` function. The buffer pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the closureâ€™s execution. It is undefined behavior to attempt to mutate through the pointer by conversion to `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` or any other mutable pointer type. If you want to mutate a value by writing through a pointer, use `withUnsafeMutableBytes(of:_:)` instead.

## Return Value

The return value, if any, of the `body` closure.

## Discussion

The buffer pointer argument to the `body` closure provides a collection interface to the raw bytes of `value`. The buffer is the size of the instance passed as `value` and does not include any remote storage.
