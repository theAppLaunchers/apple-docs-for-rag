``` source
static func - (operand: Self) -> Self
```

## Return Value

The additive inverse of this value.

## Discussion

The negation operator (prefix `-`) returns the additive inverse of its argument.

```
let x = 21
let y = -x
// y == -21
```

The resulting value must be representable in the same type as the argument. In particular, negating a signed, fixed-width integer typeâ€™s minimum results in a value that cannot be represented.

```
let z = -Int8.min
// Overflow error
```
