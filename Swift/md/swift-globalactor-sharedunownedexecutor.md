## Discussion

When declaring a global actor with a custom executor, prefer to implement the underlying actorâ€™s unownedExecutor property, and leave this `sharedUnownedExecutor` default implementation in-place as it will simply delegate to the `shared.unownedExecutor`.

The value of this property must be equivalent to `shared.unownedExecutor`, as it may be used by the Swift concurrency runtime or explicit user code with that assumption in mind.

Returning different executors for different invocations of this computed property is also illegal, as it could lead to inconsistent synchronization of the underlying actor.
