```

## Discussion

The value is available throughout the execution of the operation closure, including any `get` operations performed by child-tasks created during the execution of the operation closure.

If the same task-local is bound multiple times, be it in the same task, or in specific child tasks, the more specific (i.e. “deeper”) binding is returned when the value is read.

If the value is a reference type, it will be retained for the duration of the operation closure.
