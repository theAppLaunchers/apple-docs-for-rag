``` source
func move() -> Pointee
```

## Return Value

The instance referenced by this pointer.

## Discussion

Calling the `move()` method on a pointer `p` that references memory of type `T` is equivalent to the following code, aside from any cost and incidental side effects of copying and destroying the value:

```
let value: T = {
    defer { p.deinitialize(count: 1) }
    return p.pointee
}()
```

The memory referenced by this pointer must be initialized. After calling `move()`, the memory is uninitialized.
