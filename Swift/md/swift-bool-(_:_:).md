Operator

# \|\|(\_:\_:)

Performs a logical OR operation on two Boolean values.

``` source
static func || (lhs: Bool, rhs: @autoclosure () throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`lhs`  

The left-hand side of the operation.

`rhs`  

The right-hand side of the operation.

## Discussion

The logical OR operator (`||`) combines two Boolean values and returns `true` if at least one of the values is `true`. If both values are `false`, the operator returns `false`.

This operator uses short-circuit evaluation: The left-hand side (`lhs`) is evaluated first, and the right-hand side (`rhs`) is evaluated only if `lhs` evaluates to `false`. For example:

```
let majorErrors: Set = ["No first name", "No last name", ...]
let error = ""

if error.isEmpty || !majorErrors.contains(error) {
    print("No major errors detected")
} else {
    print("Major error: \(error)")
}
// Prints "No major errors detected"
```

In this example, `lhs` tests whether `error` is an empty string. Evaluation of the `||` operator is one of the following:

- When `error` is an empty string, `lhs` evaluates to `true` and `rhs` is not evaluated, skipping the call to `majorErrors.contains(_:)`. The result of the operation is `true`.

- When `error` is not an empty string, `lhs` evaluates to `false` and `rhs` is evaluated. The result of evaluating `rhs` is the result of the `||` operation.
