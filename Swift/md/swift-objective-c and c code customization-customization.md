# Objective-C and C Code Customization

Apply macros to your Objective-C APIs to customize how theyâ€™re imported into Swift.

## Topics

### Customizing Objective-C APIs

Designating Nullability in Objective-C APIs

Use nullability annotations or mark regions as annotated to control how Objective-C declarations are imported into Swift.

Renaming Objective-C APIs for Swift

Use the `NS_SWIFT_NAME` macro to customize API names for Swift.

Improving Objective-C API Declarations for Swift

Use the `NS_REFINED_FOR_SWIFT` macro to change how an API is imported into Swift.

Grouping Related Objective-C Constants

Add macros to your Objective-C types to group their values in Swift.

Marking API Availability in Objective-C

Use `a` macro to denote the availability of an Objective-C API.

Making Objective-C APIs Unavailable in Swift

Use the `NS_SWIFT_UNAVAILABLE` macro to prevent an API from being used in Swift.

### Customizing C APIs

Customizing Your C Code for Swift

Use the `CF_SWIFT_NAME` macro to group functions that have related behavior.
