``` source
func joined(separator: String = "") -> String
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `StringProtocol`.

## Parameters 

`separator`  

A string to insert between each of the elements in this sequence. The default separator is an empty string.

## Return Value

A single, concatenated string.

## Discussion

The following example shows how an array of strings can be joined to a single, comma-separated string:

```
let cast = ["Vivien", "Marlon", "Kim", "Karl"]
let list = cast.joined(separator: ", ")
print(list)
// Prints "Vivien, Marlon, Kim, Karl"
```

### Splitting and Joining Elements

func split(maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool, whereSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [ArraySlice&lt;Self.Element>]

Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, that donâ€™t contain elements satisfying the given predicate. Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.

func split(separator: Self.Element, maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool) -> [ArraySlice&lt;Self.Element>]

Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, around elements equal to the given element.

func joined() -> FlattenSequence&lt;Self>

Returns the elements of this sequence of sequences, concatenated.

func joined&lt;Separator>(separator: Separator) -> JoinedSequence&lt;Self>

Returns the concatenated elements of this sequence of sequences, inserting the given separator between each element.
