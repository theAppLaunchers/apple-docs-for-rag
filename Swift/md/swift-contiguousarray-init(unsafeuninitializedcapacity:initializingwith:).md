``` source
init(
    unsafeUninitializedCapacity: Int,
    initializingWith initializer: (inout UnsafeMutableBufferPointer, inout Int) throws -> Void
) rethrows
```

## Parameters 

`unsafeUninitializedCapacity`  

The number of elements to allocate space for in the new array.

`initializer`  

A closure that initializes elements and sets the count of the new array.

- Parameters:

  - buffer: A buffer covering uninitialized memory with room for the specified number of elements.

  - initializedCount: The count of initialized elements in the array, which begins as zero. Set `initializedCount` to the number of elements you initialize.

## Discussion

Inside the closure, set the `initializedCount` parameter to the number of elements that are initialized by the closure. The memory in the range `buffer[0..
