``` source
func filter(_ isIncluded: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.Element]
```

## Parameters 

`isIncluded`  

A closure that takes an element of the sequence as its argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the element should be included in the returned array.

## Return Value

An array of the elements that `isIncluded` allowed.

## Discussion

In this example, `filter(_:)` is used to include only names shorter than five characters.

```
let cast = ["Vivien", "Marlon", "Kim", "Karl"]
let shortNames = cast.filter { $0.count 

Complexity

O(*n*), where *n* is the length of the sequence.
