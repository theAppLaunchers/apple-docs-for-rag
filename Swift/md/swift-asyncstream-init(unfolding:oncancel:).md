Initializer

# init(unfolding:onCancel:)

Constructs an asynchronous stream from a given element-producing closure, with an optional closure to handle cancellation.

``` source
@preconcurrency
init(
    unfolding produce: @escaping () async -> Element?,
    onCancel: (() -> Void)? = nil
)
```

## Parameters 

`produce`  

A closure that asynchronously produces elements for the stream.

`onCancel`  

A closure to execute when canceling the stream’s task.

## Discussion

Use this convenience initializer when you have an asynchronous function that can produce elements for the stream, and don’t want to invoke a continuation manually. This initializer “unfolds” your closure into an asynchronous stream. The created stream handles conformance to the `AsyncSequence` protocol automatically, including termination (either by cancellation or by returning `nil` from the closure to finish iteration).

The following example shows an `AsyncStream` created with this initializer that produces random numbers on a one-second interval. This example uses the Swift multiple trailing closure syntax, which omits the `unfolding` parameter label.

```
let stream = AsyncStream {
    await Task.sleep(1 * 1_000_000_000)
    return Int.random(in: 1...10)
} onCancel: { @Sendable () in print("Canceled.") }

// Call point:
for await random in stream {
    print(random)
}
```
