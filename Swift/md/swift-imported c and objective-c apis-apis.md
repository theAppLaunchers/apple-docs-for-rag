# Imported C and Objective-C APIs

Use native Swift syntax to interoperate with types and functions in C and Objective-C.

## Overview

You can access and use pieces of code written in C and Objective-C from within your Swift code. After you import an Objective-C framework, a C library, or a header file, you can work with Objective-C classes and protocols, as well as common C constructs, functions, and patterns.

## Topics

### Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project

Access your Swift code from within your Objective-C codebase, and your Objective-C code from Swift.

Importing Objective-C into Swift

Access classes and other declarations from your Objective-C code in Swift.

Importing Swift into Objective-C

Access Swift types and declarations from within your Objective-C codebase.

### Cocoa Frameworks

Working with Foundation Types

Use bridged Foundation types in your Swift codebase to work with dates, times, and other values.

Working with Core Foundation Types

Work directly with memory-managed Core Foundation types in your Swift code, and manually handle retains as needed.

### Objective-C APIs
