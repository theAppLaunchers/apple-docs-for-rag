``` source
func initialize(from source: S) -> (unwritten: S.Iterator, index: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer.Index) where Element == S.Element, S : Sequence
```

## Parameters 

`source`  

A sequence of elements with which to initialize the buffer.

## Return Value

An iterator to any elements of `source` that didn’t fit in the buffer, and an index to the next uninitialized element in the buffer.

## Discussion

Prior to calling the `initialize(from:)` method on a buffer, the memory it references must be uninitialized, or its `Element` type must be a trivial type. After the call, the memory referenced by the buffer up to, but not including, the returned index is initialized. The buffer must contain sufficient memory to accommodate `source.underestimatedCount`.

The returned index is the position of the next uninitialized element in the buffer, which is one past the last element written. If `source` contains no elements, the returned index is equal to the buffer’s `startIndex`. If `source` contains an equal or greater number of elements than the buffer can hold, the returned index is equal to the buffer’s `endIndex`.
