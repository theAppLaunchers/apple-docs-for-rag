``` source
mutating func formUnion(_ other: Self)
```

**Required** Default implementation provided.

## Parameters 

`other`  

A set of the same type as the current set.

## Discussion

In the following example, the elements of the `visitors` set are added to the `attendees` set:

```
var attendees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Diana"]
let visitors: Set = ["Diana", "Marcia", "Nathaniel"]
attendees.formUnion(visitors)
print(attendees)
// Prints "["Diana", "Nathaniel", "Bethany", "Alicia", "Marcia"]"
```

If the set already contains one or more elements that are also in `other`, the existing members are kept.

```
var initialIndices = Set(0..
