```

## Return Value

A `YieldResult` that indicates the success or failure of the yield operation.

## Discussion

Use this method with `AsyncStream` instances whose `Element` type is `Void`. In this case, the `yield()` call unblocks the awaiting iteration; there is no value to return.

If you call this method repeatedly, each call returns immediately, without blocking for any awaiting consumption from the iteration.
