## Discussion

The *exponent* of a floating-point value is the integer part of the logarithm of the valueâ€™s magnitude. For a value `x` of a floating-point type `F`, the magnitude can be calculated as the following, where `**` is exponentiation:

```
x.significand * (F.radix ** x.exponent)
```

In the next example, `y` has a value of `21.5`, which is encoded as `1.34375 * 2 ** 4`. The significand of `y` is therefore 1.34375.

```
let y: Double = 21.5
// y.significand == 1.34375
// y.exponent == 4
// Double.radix == 2
```

The `exponent` property has the following edge cases:

- If `x` is zero, then `x.exponent` is `Int.min`.

- If `x` is +/-infinity or NaN, then `x.exponent` is `Int.max`

This property implements the `logB` operation defined by the IEEE 754 specification.
