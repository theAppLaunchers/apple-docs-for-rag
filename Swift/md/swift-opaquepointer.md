struct OpaquePointer
```

## Overview

Opaque pointers are used to represent C pointers to types that cannot be represented in Swift, such as incomplete struct types.

## Topics

### Initializers

init(UnsafeRawPointer)

init?(UnsafeMutableRawPointer?)

init&lt;T>(UnsafePointer&lt;T>)

Converts a typed `UnsafePointer` to an opaque C pointer.

init?(UnsafeRawPointer?)

init&lt;T>(UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;T>)

Converts a typed `UnsafeMutablePointer` to an opaque C pointer.

init(UnsafeMutableRawPointer)

init?&lt;T>(UnsafePointer&lt;T>?)

Converts a typed `UnsafePointer` to an opaque C pointer.

init?&lt;T>(UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;T>?)

Converts a typed `UnsafeMutablePointer` to an opaque C pointer.

init?(bitPattern: Int)

Creates a new `OpaquePointer` from the given address, specified as a bit pattern.

init?(bitPattern: UInt)

Creates a new `OpaquePointer` from the given address, specified as a bit pattern.
