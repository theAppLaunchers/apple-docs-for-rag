``` source
@discardableResult
func yield(_ value: sending Element) -> AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation.YieldResult
```

## Parameters 

`value`  

The value to yield from the continuation.

## Return Value

A `YieldResult` that indicates the success or failure of the yield operation.

## Discussion

If nothing is awaiting the next value, the method attempts to buffer the resultâ€™s element.

This can be called more than once and returns to the caller immediately without blocking for any awaiting consumption from the iteration.
