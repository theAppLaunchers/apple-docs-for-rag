``` source
func union(_ other: Self) -> Self
```

**Required** Default implementation provided.

## Parameters 

`other`  

A set of the same type as the current set.

## Return Value

A new set with the unique elements of this set and `other`.

## Discussion

In the following example, the `attendeesAndVisitors` set is made up of the elements of the `attendees` and `visitors` sets:

```
let attendees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Diana"]
let visitors = ["Marcia", "Nathaniel"]
let attendeesAndVisitors = attendees.union(visitors)
print(attendeesAndVisitors)
// Prints "["Diana", "Nathaniel", "Bethany", "Alicia", "Marcia"]"
```

If the set already contains one or more elements that are also in `other`, the existing members are kept.

```
let initialIndices = Set(0..

Note

If this set and `other` contain elements that are equal but distinguishable (e.g. via `===`), which of these elements is present in the result is unspecified.
