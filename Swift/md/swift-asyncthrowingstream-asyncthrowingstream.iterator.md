``` source
struct Iterator
```

Available when `Failure` conforms to `Error`.

## Overview

This type is not `Sendable`. Donâ€™t use it from multiple concurrent contexts. It is a programmer error to invoke `next()` from a concurrent context that contends with another such call, which results in a call to `fatalError()`.

## Topics

### Iterating over Elements

func next() async throws -> Element?

The next value from the asynchronous stream.

### Instance Methods

func next(isolation: isolated (any Actor)?) async throws(Failure) -> Element?

The next value from the asynchronous stream.
