## Discussion

The `PlaygroundQuickLook` protocol is deprecated, and will be removed from the standard library in a future Swift release. To customize the logging of your type in a playground, conform to the `CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible` protocol, which does not use the `PlaygroundQuickLook` enum.

If you need to provide a customized playground representation in Swift 4.0 or Swift 3.2 or earlier, use a conditional compilation block:

```
#if swift(>=4.1) || (swift(>=3.3) && !swift(>=4.0))
    // With Swift 4.1 and later (including Swift 3.3 and later), use
    // the CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible protocol.
#else
    // With Swift 4.0 and Swift 3.2 and earlier, use PlaygroundQuickLook
    // and the CustomPlaygroundQuickLookable protocol.
#endif
```
