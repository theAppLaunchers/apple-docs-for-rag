## Discussion

This numeric type includes fractions such as “⅕” (U+2155 VULGAR FRACTION ONE FIFTH), numerical CJK ideographs like “兆” (U+5146 CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-5146), and other scalars that are not decimal digits used positionally in the writing of base-10 numbers.

As of Unicode 6.3, any new scalars that represent numbers but do not meet the requirements of `decimal` will have numeric type `numeric`, and programs can treat `digit` and `numeric` equivalently.
