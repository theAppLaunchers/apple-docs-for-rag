``` source
init?(
    _ idx: String.Index,
    within target: String.UTF8View
)
```

## Parameters 

`idx`  

A position in a `String` or one of its views.

`target`  

The `UTF8View` in which to find the new position.

## Discussion

The following example finds the position of a space in a string‚Äôs `utf16` view and then converts that position to an index in the string‚Äôs `utf8` view.

```
let cafe = "Caf√© üçµ"

let utf16Index = cafe.utf16.firstIndex(of: 32)!
let utf8Index = String.UTF8View.Index(utf16Index, within: cafe.utf8)!

print(Array(cafe.utf8[..

If the position passed in `utf16Index` doesn‚Äôt have an exact corresponding position in `utf8`, the result of the initializer is `nil`. For example, because UTF-8 and UTF-16 represent high Unicode code points differently, an attempt to convert the position of the trailing surrogate of a UTF-16 surrogate pair fails.

The next example attempts to convert the indices of the two UTF-16 code points that represent the teacup emoji (`"üçµ"`). The index of the lead surrogate is successfully converted to a position in `utf8`, but the index of the trailing surrogate is not.

```
let emojiHigh = cafe.utf16.index(after: utf16Index)
print(String.UTF8View.Index(emojiHigh, within: cafe.utf8))
// Prints "Optional(String.Index(...))"

let emojiLow = cafe.utf16.index(after: emojiHigh)
print(String.UTF8View.Index(emojiLow, within: cafe.utf8))
// Prints "nil"
```
