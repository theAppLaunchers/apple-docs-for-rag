``` source
mutating func formUnion(_ other: S) where Element == S.Element, S : Sequence
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `Hashable`.

## Parameters 

`other`  

A sequence of elements. `other` must be finite.

## Discussion

If the set already contains one or more elements that are also in `other`, the existing members are kept. If `other` contains multiple instances of equivalent elements, only the first instance is kept.

```
var attendees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Diana"]
let visitors = ["Diana", "Marcia", "Nathaniel"]
attendees.formUnion(visitors)
print(attendees)
// Prints "["Diana", "Nathaniel", "Bethany", "Alicia", "Marcia"]"
```
