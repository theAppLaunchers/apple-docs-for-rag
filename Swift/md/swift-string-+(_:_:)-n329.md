``` source
static func + (lhs: Self, rhs: Other) -> Self where Other : Sequence, Self.Element == Other.Element
```

## Parameters 

`lhs`  

A range-replaceable collection.

`rhs`  

A collection or finite sequence.

## Discussion

The two arguments must have the same `Element` type. For example, you can concatenate the elements of an integer array and a `Range` instance.

```
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let moreNumbers = numbers + (5...10)
print(moreNumbers)
// Prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"
```

The resulting collection has the type of the argument on the left-hand side. In the example above, `moreNumbers` has the same type as `numbers`, which is `[Int]`.
