mutating func next(isolation actor: isolated (any Actor)?) async throws -> Base.Element?

## Discussion

This iterator calls `next(isolation:)` on its base iterator and evaluates the result with the `predicate` closure. As long as the predicate returns `true`, this method returns `nil`. After the predicate returns `false`, for a value received from the base iterator, this method returns that value. After that, the iterator returns values received from its base iterator as-is, and never executes the predicate closure again. If calling the closure throws an error, the sequence ends and `next(isolation:)` rethrows the error.
