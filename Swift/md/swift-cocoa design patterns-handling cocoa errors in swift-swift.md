# Handling Cocoa Errors in Swift

Throw and catch errors that use Cocoa’s error types.

## Overview

You use Swift’s `throw` statement and `do`-`catch` statement to throw and catch errors from Cocoa APIs. Swift imports Cocoa methods with error parameters as throwing methods, as described in About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters.

### Catch Errors

In Swift, calling a method that throws requires explicit error handling. Because Cocoa methods with errors parameters are imported as throwing methods, you handle them using Swift’s `do`-`catch` statement.

Here’s an example of how you handle an error when calling a method in Objective-C:

```
NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
NSURL *fromURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/path/to/old"];
NSURL *toURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/path/to/new"];
NSError *error = nil;
BOOL success = [fileManager moveItemAtURL:fromURL toURL:toURL error:&error];
if (!success) {
    NSLog(@"Error: %@", error.domain);
}
```

Here’s how you handle the same error in Swift:

```
let fileManager = FileManager.default
let fromURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/old")
let toURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/new")
do {
    try fileManager.moveItem(at: fromURL, to: toURL)
} catch let error as NSError {
    print("Error: \(error.domain)")
}
```

You can also use the `do`-`catch` statement to match on specific Cocoa error codes to differentiate possible failure conditions:

```
do {
    try fileManager.moveItem(at: fromURL, to: toURL)
} catch CocoaError.fileNoSuchFile {
    print("Error: no such file exists")
} catch CocoaError.fileReadUnsupportedScheme {
    print("Error: unsupported scheme (should be 'file://')")
}
```

### Throw Errors

You throw Cocoa errors by initializing a Cocoa error type and passing in the relevant error domain and code:

```
throw NSError(domain: NSURLErrorDomain, code: NSURLErrorCannotOpenFile, userInfo: nil)
```

If Objective-C code calls a Swift method that throws an error, the error is automatically propagated to the error pointer argument of the bridged Objective-C method.

### Throw and Catch Errors from Custom Error Domains

You use custom error domains in Cocoa to group related categories of errors. The example below uses the `NS_ERROR_ENUM` macro to group error constants:

```
extern NSErrorDomain const MyErrorDomain;
typedef NS_ERROR_ENUM(MyErrorDomain, MyError) {
    specificError1 = 0,
    specificError2 = 1
};
```

This example shows how to throw errors using that custom error type in Swift:

```
func customThrow() throws {
    throw NSError(
        domain: MyErrorDomain,
        code: MyError.specificError2.rawValue,
        userInfo: [
            NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "A customized error from MyErrorDomain."
        ]
    )
}
```

This example shows how to catch errors from a particular error domain and bring attention to unhandled errors from other error domains:

```
do {
    try customThrow()
} catch MyError.specificError1 {
    print("Caught specific error #1")
} catch let error as MyError where error.code == .specificError2 {
    print("Caught specific error #2, ", error.localizedDescription)
    // Prints "Caught specific error #2. A customized error from MyErrorDomain."
} catch let error {
    fatalError("Some other error: \(error)")
}
```

### Handle Exceptions in Objective-C Only

In Objective-C, exceptions are distinct from errors. Objective-C exception handling uses the `@try`, `@catch`, and `@throw` syntax to indicate unrecoverable programmer errors. This is distinct from the Cocoa pattern—described above—that uses a trailing NSError parameter to indicate recoverable errors that you plan for during development.

In Swift, you can recover from errors passed using Cocoa’s error pattern, as described above in Catch Errors. However, there’s no safe way to recover from Objective-C exceptions in Swift. To handle Objective-C exceptions, write Objective-C code that catches exceptions before they reach any Swift code.
