func isSubset(of other: Set) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`other`  

Another set.

## Return Value

`true` if the set is a subset of `other`; otherwise, `false`.

## Discussion

Set *A* is a subset of another set *B* if every member of *A* is also a member of *B*.

```
let employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Chris", "Diana", "Eric"]
let attendees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Diana"]
print(attendees.isSubset(of: employees))
// Prints "true"
```
