``` source
var isEmpty: Bool { get }
```

## Return Value

`true` if the group has no pending tasks; otherwise `false`.

## Discussion

At the start of the body of a `withThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup(returning:body:)` call, the task group is always empty.

Itâ€™s guaranteed to be empty when returning from that body because a task group waits for all child tasks to complete before returning.
