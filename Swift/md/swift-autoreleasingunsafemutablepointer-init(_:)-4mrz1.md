Initializer

# init(\_:)

Explicit construction from an UnsafeMutablePointer.

``` source
init(_ from: UnsafeMutablePointer)
```

## Discussion

This is inherently unsafe; UnsafeMutablePointer assumes the referenced memory has +1 strong ownership semantics, whereas AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer implies +0 semantics.

Warning

Accessing `pointee` as a type that is unrelated to the underlying memoryâ€™s bound type is undefined.
