``` source
func withVaList(
    _ args: [any CVarArg],
    _ body: (CVaListPointer) -> R
) -> R
```

## Parameters 

`args`  

An array of arguments to convert to a C `va_list` pointer.

`body`  

A closure with a `CVaListPointer` parameter that references the arguments passed as `args`. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withVaList(_:)` function. The pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the functionâ€™s execution.

## Return Value

The return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.

## Discussion

The pointer passed as an argument to `body` is valid only during the execution of `withVaList(_:_:)`. Do not store or return the pointer for later use.

If you need to pass an optional pointer as a `CVarArg` argument, use the `Int(bitPattern:)` initializer to interpret the optional pointer as an `Int` value, which has the same C variadic calling conventions as a pointer on all supported platforms.

struct CVaListPointer

protocol CVarArg

A type whose instances can be encoded, and appropriately passed, as elements of a C `va_list`.

func getVaList([any CVarArg]) -> CVaListPointer
