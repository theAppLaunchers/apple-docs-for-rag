``` source
static func encodeAtomicRepresentation(_ value: consuming UnsafeMutableRawPointer) -> UnsafeMutableRawPointer.AtomicRepresentation
```

## Parameters 

`value`  

A valid instance of `Self` thatâ€™s about to be destroyed to encode an instance of its `AtomicRepresentation`.

## Return Value

The newly encoded `AtomicRepresentation` storage.

## Discussion

Note

This is not an atomic operation. This simply encodes the logical type `Self` into its storage representation suitable for atomic operations, `AtomicRepresentation`.
