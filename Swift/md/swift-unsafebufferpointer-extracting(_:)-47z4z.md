``` source
func extracting(_ bounds: some RangeExpression) -> UnsafeBufferPointer
```

## Parameters 

`bounds`  

A valid range of indices within this buffer.

## Return Value

A new buffer pointer over the items at `bounds`.

## Discussion

The returned bufferâ€™s first item is always at index 0; unlike buffer slices, extracted buffers do not generally share their indices with the original buffer pointer.

```
withUnsafeTemporaryAllocation(of: Int.self, capacity: 5) { buffer in
  buffer.initialize(repeating: 0)
  // buffer contains [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  let part = buffer.extracting(2...)
  part[0] = 1
  part[1] = 2
  // buffer now contains [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]
}
```

When `Element` is copyable, the `extracting` operation is equivalent to slicing the buffer then rebasing the resulting buffer slice:

```
let a = buffer.extracting(i ..

However, unlike slicing, the `extracting` operation remains available even if `Element` happens to be noncopyable.
