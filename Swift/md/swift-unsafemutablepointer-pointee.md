## Discussion

When reading from the `pointee` property, the instance referenced by this pointer must already be initialized. When `pointee` is used as the left side of an assignment, the instance is updated. The instance must be initialized or this pointerâ€™s `Pointee` type must be a trivial type.

Uninitialized memory cannot be initialized to a nontrivial type using `pointee`. Instead, use an initializing method, such as `initialize(to:)`.
