# subscript(\_:)

Accesses a contiguous subrange of the collection’s elements.

``` source
subscript(r: Range) -> Substring { get }
```

## Overview

The accessed slice uses the same indices for the same elements as the original collection uses. Always use the slice’s `startIndex` property instead of assuming that its indices start at a particular value.

This example demonstrates getting a slice of an array of strings, finding the index of one of the strings in the slice, and then using that index in the original array.

```
let streets = ["Adams", "Bryant", "Channing", "Douglas", "Evarts"]
let streetsSlice = streets[2 ..

subscript&lt;R>(R) -> Self.SubSequence

Accesses the contiguous subrange of the collection’s elements specified by a range expression.

subscript((UnboundedRange_) -> ()) -> Self.SubSequence

func prefix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the collection.

func prefix(through: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection through the specified position.

func prefix(upTo: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the specified position.

func prefix(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence containing the initial elements until `predicate` returns `false` and skipping the remaining elements.

func suffix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the collection.

func suffix(from: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the specified position to the end of the collection.
