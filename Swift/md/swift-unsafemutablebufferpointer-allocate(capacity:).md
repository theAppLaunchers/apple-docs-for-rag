``` source
static func allocate(capacity count: Int) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer
```

## Parameters 

`count`  

The amount of memory to allocate, counted in instances of `Element`.

## Discussion

The resulting buffer references a region of memory that is bound to `Element` and is `count * MemoryLayout.stride` bytes in size.

The following example allocates a buffer that can store four `Int` instances and then initializes that memory with the elements of a range:

```
let buffer = UnsafeMutableBufferPointer.allocate(capacity: 4)
_ = buffer.initialize(from: 1...4)
print(buffer[2])
// Prints "3"
```

When you allocate memory, always remember to deallocate once youâ€™re finished.

```
buffer.deallocate()
```
