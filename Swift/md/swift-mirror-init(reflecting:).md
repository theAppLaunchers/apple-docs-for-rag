# init(reflecting:)

Creates a mirror that reflects on the given instance.

``` source
init(reflecting subject: Any)
```

## Parameters 

`subject`  

The instance for which to create a mirror.

## Discussion

If the dynamic type of `subject` conforms to `CustomReflectable`, the resulting mirror is determined by its `customMirror` property. Otherwise, the result is generated by the language.

If the dynamic type of `subject` has value semantics, subsequent mutations of `subject` will not observable in `Mirror`. In general, though, the observability of mutations is unspecified.
