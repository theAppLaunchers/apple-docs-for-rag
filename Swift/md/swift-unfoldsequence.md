Structure

# UnfoldSequence

A sequence whose elements are produced via repeated applications of a closure to some mutable state.

``` source
@frozen
struct UnfoldSequence
```

## Overview

The elements of the sequence are computed lazily and the sequence may potentially be infinite in length.

Instances of `UnfoldSequence` are created with the functions `sequence(first:next:)` and `sequence(state:next:)`.

## Topics

### Type Aliases

typealias UnfoldFirstSequence

The return type of `sequence(first:next:)`.

typealias Iterator

A type that provides the sequenceâ€™s iteration interface and encapsulates its iteration state.

### Instance Methods

func next() -> Element?

Advances to the next element and returns it, or `nil` if no next element exists.

### Default Implementations

Sequence Implementations

## Relationships

### Conforms To

- IteratorProtocol
- Sendable

  Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Copyable`, `Element` conforms to `Escapable`, `Element` conforms to `Sendable`, `State` conforms to `Copyable`, `State` conforms to `Escapable`, and `State` conforms to `Sendable`.

- Sequence
