Instance Method

# loadUnaligned(fromByteOffset:as:)

Returns a new instance of the given type, constructed from the raw memory at the specified offset.

``` source
func loadUnaligned(
    fromByteOffset offset: Int = 0,
    as type: T.Type
) -> T where T : BitwiseCopyable
```

## Parameters 

`offset`  

The offset, in bytes, into the buffer pointer’s memory at which to begin reading data for the new instance. The default is zero.

`type`  

The type to use for the newly constructed instance. The memory must be initialized to a value of a type that is layout compatible with `type`.

## Return Value

A new instance of type `T`, copied from the buffer pointer’s memory.

## Discussion

This function only supports loading trivial types. A trivial type does not contain any reference-counted property within its in-memory stored representation. The memory at `offset` bytes into the buffer must be laid out identically to the in-memory representation of `T`.

You can use this method to create new values from the buffer pointer’s underlying bytes. The following example creates two new `Int32` instances from the memory referenced by the buffer pointer `someBytes`. The bytes for `a` are copied from the first four bytes of `someBytes`, and the bytes for `b` are copied from the fourth through seventh bytes.

```
let a = someBytes.loadUnaligned(as: Int32.self)
let b = someBytes.loadUnaligned(fromByteOffset: 3, as: Int32.self)
```

The memory to read for the new instance must not extend beyond the buffer pointer’s memory region—that is, `offset + MemoryLayout.size` must be less than or equal to the buffer pointer’s `count`.
