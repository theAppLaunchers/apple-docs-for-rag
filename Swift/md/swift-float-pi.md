static var pi: Float { get }
```

## Discussion

When measuring an angle in radians, π is equivalent to a half-turn.

This value is rounded toward zero to keep user computations with angles from inadvertently ending up in the wrong quadrant. A type that conforms to the `FloatingPoint` protocol provides the value for `pi` at its best possible precision.

```
print(Double.pi)
// Prints "3.14159265358979"
```
