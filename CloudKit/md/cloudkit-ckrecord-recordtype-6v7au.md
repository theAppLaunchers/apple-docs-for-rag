## Discussion

Use this value to differentiate between different record types in your app. The value is primarily for your benefit, so choose record types that represent the data in the corresponding records.

CloudKit provides two system-defined record types:

| Record Type | Description |
|----|----|
| CKRecordTypeUserRecord | Identifies records that represent users. |
| CKRecordTypeShare | Identifies records that the user shares. |
