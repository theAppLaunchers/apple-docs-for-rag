## Discussion

This property applies to query-based subscriptions and zone-based subscriptions. Specifying a record zone ID limits the scope of the query to only the records in that zone. For zone-based subscriptions, the query includes all records in the specified record zone. For a query-based subscription, the query includes only records of a specific type in the specified record zone.

For zone-based subscriptions, CloudKit sets this propertyâ€™s value automatically. For all other subscription types, the default value is `nil`. If you want to scope your query-based subscription to a specific record zone, you must assign a value explicitly.
