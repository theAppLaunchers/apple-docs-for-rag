## Discussion

A query-based subscription uses its search predicate to identify potential matches for records. It combines the predicate information with the value in the querySubscriptionOptions property to determine when to send a push notification to the app.

The search predicate defines the records that the subscription object monitors for changes. The system only uses the propertyâ€™s value when the subscriptionType property is CKSubscription.SubscriptionType.query. Otherwise, the system ignores it.
