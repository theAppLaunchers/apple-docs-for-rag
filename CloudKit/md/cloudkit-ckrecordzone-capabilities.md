## Discussion

The server determines the capabilities of the zone and sets the value of this property when you save the record zone. Always check this property before performing tasks that require a specific capability.

Default zones donâ€™t support any special capabilities. Custom zones in a private database support the options that CKRecordZone.Capabilities provides.
