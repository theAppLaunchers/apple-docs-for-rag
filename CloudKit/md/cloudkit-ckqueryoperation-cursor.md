## Discussion

The initial value of this property is the cursor that you provide to the init(cursor:) method. When you use a cursor, the operation ignores the contents of the query property. This propertyâ€™s value is an opaque value that CloudKit provides. For more information, see the queryCompletionBlock property.

If you intend to specify or change the value in this property, do so before you execute the operation or submit it to a queue.
