## Discussion

Use this property to view or change the IDs of the records you want to retrieve. If you use the operation that fetchCurrentUserRecordOperation() returns, CloudKit ignores the contents of this property and sets its value to `nil`.

If you intend to specify a value other than `nil`, do so before you execute the operation or add the operation to a queue. The records you fetch donâ€™t need to be in the same record zone. The record ID for each record provides the zone information that CloudKit needs to fetch the corresponding record.
