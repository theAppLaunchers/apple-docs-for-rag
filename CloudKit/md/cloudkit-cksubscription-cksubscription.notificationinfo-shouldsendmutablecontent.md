## Discussion

When this property is true, the server includes the `mutable-content` flag with a value of `1` in the push notificationâ€™s payload. When the value is `1`, the system passes the notification to your app extension for modification before delivery.

See Generating a remote notification for more information about the `mutable-content` flag, and Modifying content in newly delivered notifications for information about how to modify push notifiction content in your app extension prior to delivery.

The default value of this property is false.
