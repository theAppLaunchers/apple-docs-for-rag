## Discussion

When you use a CKModifyRecordsOperation object to save records, if the server is unable to save the changes for one record, it doesnâ€™t save the changes for any of the records. Combining this capability with the CKModifyRecordsOperation.RecordSavePolicy.ifServerRecordUnchanged policy of the operation object prevents your app from overwriting changes to a group of records if one or more of the records on the server has recent changes.
