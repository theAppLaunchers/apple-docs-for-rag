class Cursor
```

## Overview

You donâ€™t create instances of this class yourself. When fetching records using a query operation, if the number of results exceeds the limit for the query, CloudKit provides a cursor. Use that cursor to create a new instance of CKQueryOperation and retrieve the next batch of results for the same query.

For information about how to use a CKQueryOperation.Cursor object, see CKQueryOperation.
