## Overview

A sync engine has two ways to send changes to iCloud â€” periodically, in cooperation with the system scheduler, and manually, whenever your app invokes the sendChanges(_:) method. This type provides information about a single attempt to send changes that includes both the reason for the attempt and any additional options in use by the attempt.
