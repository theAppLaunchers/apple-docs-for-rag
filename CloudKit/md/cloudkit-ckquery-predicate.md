## Discussion

A predicate contains one or more expressions that evaluate to true or false. Expressions are often value-based comparisons, but predicates support other types of operators, including string comparisons and aggregate operations. For guidelines on how to construct predicates for your queries, see Predicate Rules for Query Objects.
