## Overview

You can add a location sort descriptor to your queries when searching for records. At creation time, you must provide the sort descriptor with a key that has a CLLocation object as its value. The sort descriptor uses the value of that key to perform the sort.

CloudKit computes distance by drawing a direct line between the two locations that follows the curvature of the Earth. Distances donâ€™t account for altitude changes between the two locations.

## Topics

### Creating a Location Sort Descriptor

init(key: String, relativeLocation: CLLocation)

Creates a location sort descriptor using the specified key and relative location.

init(coder: NSCoder)

Creates a location sort descriptor from a serialized instance.

### Accessing the Location Value
