Initializer

# init(recordID:action:)

Creates a reference object that points to the record with the specified ID.

iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.10+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+watchOS 3.0+

``` source
init(
    recordID: CKRecord.ID,
    action: CKRecord.ReferenceAction
)
```

## Parameters 

`recordID`  

The ID of the target record. This method throws an exception if you specify `nil` for this parameter.

`action`  

The ownership option use between the target record and any records that incorporate this reference object. If you specify the CKRecord.ReferenceAction.deleteSelf option, the record that the `recordID` parameter references becomes the owner of (or acts as the parent of) any objects that use this reference object. For a list of possible values, see CKRecord.ReferenceAction.

## Return Value

An initialized reference object that points to the specified record, or `nil` if CloudKit canâ€™t initialize the reference.

## Discussion

Use this method when you have only the ID of the record for the target of a link. You might use this method if you save only the ID of the record to a local data cache.

When you create a reference object for use in a search predicate, the predicate ignores the value in the `action` parameter. Search predicates use only the ID of the record during their comparison.
