var originalDetection: CNDetection? { get }
```

## Discussion

This is the way to determine the time and bounds from which the fixed focus originated. This detection isnâ€™t part of the detection track and has a different detection ID or none.

Important

To get a detection from the fixed detection track, use detectionAtOrBeforeTime: instead, which returns a properly time-stamped detection.
