Initializer

# init(originalDetection:)

Creates a detection track with fixed focus at the disparity of an existing detection.

iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 17.0+

``` source
init(originalDetection: CNDetection)
```

## Parameters 

`originalDetection`  

This fixed detection track based on the original detection.

## Discussion

This is the way to determine the time and bounds from which the fixed focus originated. This detection isnâ€™t part of the detection track and has a different detection ID or none.

Important

To get a detection from the fixed detection track, use detectionAtOrBeforeTime: instead, which returns a properly time-stamped detection.
