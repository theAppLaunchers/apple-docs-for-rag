## Possible Values

Tolls  
When you set `avoid=Tolls`, routes without tolls are higher up in the list of returned routes. Note that even when you set `avoid=Tolls`, the routes the server returns may contain tolls (if no reasonable toll-free routes exist). Ensure you check the value of `routes[i].hasTolls` in the response to verify toll assumptions.
