# Creating a Maps identifier and a private key

Create a Maps identifier and a private key before generating tokens for MapKit JS.

## Overview

MapKit JS uses a token to authenticate map initializations and other API requests. Before you can create a token, you need a Maps identifier (Maps ID) and private key that’s associated with a Maps ID.

You create a Maps ID and private keys through your Apple Developer Account. After you complete the steps to obtain these items you can construct a token and sign it with your private key, as Creating and using tokens with Maps Server API describes.

### Create a Maps ID

A Maps ID is a string that you provide to identify a domain or environment that calls the MapKit JS API. Maps IDs use reverse-domain-style notation with three or four fields separated by a dot. The first field must be `maps`; the remainder of this string can be a name that’s meaningful to you. For example, your string might resemble `maps.com.mywebsite` or `maps.com.mycompany.mywebsite`.

To create a Maps ID, follow these steps:

1.  Go to developer.apple.com/account and log in with your Apple Developer credentials.

2.  Under Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles, click Identifiers in the sidebar.

3.  At the top of the identifiers list, click the Add Identifiers button (+).

4.  On the following page, select the Maps IDs checkbox, and then click the Continue button at the top of the page.

5.  Enter a string for the description. This can be your app name, team name, project name, or anything that conveys context and is meaningful to you.

6.  Enter a reverse-domain-style string for the identifier (for example, `maps.com.mycompany.mywebsite`), then click Continue.

7.  Review the information, then click Register.

If you have multiple environments, such as a development environment and a production environment, it’s good practice to create separate Maps IDs and keys for each environment. That way, if a key you use in production becomes compromised, revoking it doesn’t affect your UAT or test environments.

### Obtain a MapKit JS private key

After you create a Maps ID, the next steps are to create a private key, add the MapKit JS service to this key, and associate it with a Maps ID:

1.  In Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles, click Keys in the sidebar, then click the Keys + button at the top of the keys list.

2.  Under Key Name, enter a unique name for the key.

3.  Below that, select the checkbox next to MapKit JS. Note that the MapKit JS checkbox isn’t in an enabled state until you create a Maps ID.

4.  Near the top right of the page, click Configure. On the next page, choose a Maps ID to associate to this key from the pop-up menu, then click Save.

5.  Click Continue, review the key configuration, then click Register.

6.  Optionally, click Download to download the key. The private key is available to download a single time. If the Download button isn’t in an enabled state, you previously downloaded the key associated with this identifier.

7.  Click Done.

After executing these steps, you have a private key that you can use to sign tokens, and you can begin Creating and using tokens with Maps Server API.

Important

The private key is a shared secret between you and Apple. To keep your private key secure, don’t put your private key in public facing client-side code, and don’t share the key.

The private key doesn’t expire, but you can revoke it. Revoking a key makes it invalid and affects calls to the MapKit JS API. If you lose a key or if someone else starts using your key, revoke it. See Revoke, edit, and download keys for more information.
