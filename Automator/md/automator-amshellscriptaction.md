class AMShellScriptAction
```

## Overview

When you create a Shell Script Automator Action project in Xcode, the project template supplies an AMShellScriptAction instance as the Principal Class of the action bundle. This ready-made instance provides a default implementation of the AMAction run(withInput:) method that uses the logic defined in the script. You can substitute your own subclass of AMShellScriptAction for Principal Class if you need to.

## Topics

### Handling the I/O Separator Character

var inputFieldSeparator: String

var outputFieldSeparator: String

A string to use as a delimiter in the string output by the action.

var remapLineEndings: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether you want automatic remapping of carriage return (`\r`) to newline (`\n`) characters in the input string.
