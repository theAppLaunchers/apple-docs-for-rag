Instance Property

# isStopped

A Boolean value that indicates whether the user clicked the stop button on the parent workflow.

Mac Catalyst 14.0+macOS 10.4+

``` source
var isStopped: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

This value is true if the user clicked the stop button, or false if the workflow is still running. This property should be referenced during lengthy action processes, such as a loop, in order to determine whether to exit the operation and stop the action.
