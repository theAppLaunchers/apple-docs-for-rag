Function

# gss_unwrap(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Returns the original version of a secure message by optionally decrypting it and then extracting and verifying the attached MIC.

iOS 5.0+iPadOS 5.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.7+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
func gss_unwrap(
    _ minor_status: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ context_handle: gss_ctx_id_t,
    _ input_message_buffer: gss_buffer_t,
    _ output_message_buffer: gss_buffer_t,
    _ conf_state: UnsafeMutablePointer?,
    _ qop_state: UnsafeMutablePointer?
) -> OM_uint32
```

## Parameters 

`minor_status`  

A pointer to the secondary status result that provides additional information in case of failure.

`context_handle`  

The context used to send the message.

`input_message_buffer`  

A buffer containing the protected message from the peer.

`output_message_buffer`  

A buffer the function uses to return the unwrapped message. Release the buffer using a call to gss_release_buffer(_:_:) when you are done with it.

`conf_state`  

A pointer the function uses to indicate what protection had been applied to the message. A value of zero indicates only integrity checking. A non-zero value indicates both integrity checking and confidentiality. Pass `NULL` to ignore this output.

`qop_state`  

A pointer the function uses to return the quality of protection setting. See Quality of Protection Constants in Object Identifiers for valid values. Pass `NULL` to ignore this output.

## Return Value

A status code set to GSS_S_COMPLETE on success. See Function Status for a complete enumeration of status outputs.
