Function

# gss_add_oid_set_member(\_:\_:\_:)

Adds an object identifier into an OID set.

iOS 5.0+iPadOS 5.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.7+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
func gss_add_oid_set_member(
    _ minor_status: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ member_oid: gss_const_OID,
    _ oid_set: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OM_uint32
```

## Parameters 

`minor_status`  

A pointer to the secondary status result that provides additional information in case of failure.

`member_oid`  

The object identifier to be added.

`oid_set`  

A pointer to the set to which the new OID should be added. Use gss_create_empty_oid_set(_:_:) to create a new set.

## Return Value

A status code set to GSS_S_COMPLETE on success. See Function Status for a complete enumeration of status outputs.

## Discussion

If the OID already exists in the set, there is no action taken. Otherwise, the function adds the OID to the end of the set. Because the function adds the OID doesnâ€™t copy it, the `member_oid` pointer must remain stable while the `oid_set` is in use.
