``` source
func gss_create_empty_oid_set(
    _ minor_status: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ oid_set: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OM_uint32
```

## Parameters 

`minor_status`  

A pointer to the secondary status result that provides additional information in case of failure.

`oid_set`  

A pointer that the function uses to return the new set.
