``` source

    _ minor_status: UnsafeMutablePointer,

) -> OM_uint32
```

## Parameters 

`minor_status`  

A pointer to the secondary status result that provides additional information in case of failure.

`input_cred_handle`  

The credential to which the new element should be added. If the `output_cred_handle` parameter is `NULL`, the input credential is modified to include the new element. Otherwise, a new credential that combines the input credential with the new element is returned as the output credential. Specify GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to create a new credential with default behavior, in which case the `output_cred_handle` cannot be `NULL`.

`desired_name`  

The name of the entity for which the credential is to be acquired. Specify GSS_C_NO_NAME to get a credential with a default name or use gss_import_name(_:_:_:_:) to create a name object.

`desired_mech`  

The set of underlying security mechanisms to use with the credential. Use `GSS_C_NO_OID_SET` to get the default set.

`cred_usage`  

A flag that indicates how the credential will be used. Specify GSS_C_INITIATE for context initiation, GSS_C_ACCEPT for context acceptance, or GSS_C_BOTH for both.

`initiator_time_req`  

The time in seconds that the credential should remain valid for initiating security contexts. Use GSS_C_INDEFINITE to indicate the maximum allowed duration. The value is ignored for credentials with usage set to GSS_C_ACCEPT.

`acceptor_time_req`  

The time in seconds that the credential should remain valid for accepting security contexts. Use GSS_C_INDEFINITE to indicate the maximum allowed duration. The value is ignored for credentials with usage set to GSS_C_INITIATE.

`output_cred_handle`  

A pointer the function uses to return the credential. Set to `NULL` to modify the input credential in place. Release the credentialâ€™s memory with gss_release_cred(_:_:) when you are done with it.

`actual_mechs`  

A pointer the function uses to return the actual mechanisms used by the credential. Set to `NULL` to ignore this output. If you do receive a set of mechanisms, use gss_release_oid_set(_:_:) to release its memory when you are done with it.

`initiator_time_rec`  

A pointer the function uses to return the actual number of seconds for which the credential is valid as an initiator. Set to `NULL` to ignore this output.

`acceptor_time_rec`  

A pointer the function uses to return the actual number of seconds for which the credential is valid as an acceptor. Set to `NULL` to ignore this output.

## Return Value

A status code set to GSS_S_COMPLETE on success. See Function Status for a description of other status outputs.
