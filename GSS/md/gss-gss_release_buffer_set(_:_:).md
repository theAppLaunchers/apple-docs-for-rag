``` source
func gss_release_buffer_set(
    _ minor_status: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ buffer_set: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OM_uint32
```

## Parameters 

`minor_status`  

A pointer to the secondary status result that provides additional information in case of failure.

`buffer_set`  

A pointer to the buffer set descriptor reference that you want to free.

## Return Value

A status code set to GSS_S_COMPLETE on completion.

## Mentioned in 

Allocating and Releasing Objects

## Discussion

This call frees the memory of all of the buffers that the buffer set contains, as well as the buffer set descriptor itself. Use this function when youâ€™re done with a buffer set that you created with gss_create_empty_buffer_set(_:_:), or created on your behalf by gss_add_buffer_set_member(_:_:_:).
