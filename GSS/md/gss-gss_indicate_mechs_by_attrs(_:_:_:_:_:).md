# gss_indicate_mechs_by_attrs(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Returns the set of mechanisms that fulfill the given criteria.

``` source
func gss_indicate_mechs_by_attrs(
    _ minor_status: UnsafeMutablePointer,
    _ desired_mech_attrs: gss_const_OID_set?,
    _ except_mech_attrs: gss_const_OID_set?,
    _ critical_mech_attrs: gss_const_OID_set?,
    _ mechs: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OM_uint32
```

## Parameters 

`minor_status`  

A pointer to the secondary status result that provides additional information in case of failure.

`desired_mech_attrs`  

A set of attributes, given by their OID, that a mechanism must have in order to appear in the results. See Mechanisms and Authentication in Security Mechanisms for a list of possible values.

`except_mech_attrs`  

A set of attributes, given by their OID, that the mechanism must not have in order to appear in the results. See Mechanisms and Authentication in Security Mechanisms for a list of possible values.

`critical_mech_attrs`  

A set of attributes, given by their OID, that the mechanism must know about, but not necessarily have, in order to appear in the results. See Mechanisms and Authentication in Security Mechanisms for a list of possible values.

`mechs`  

A pointer the function uses to return a new set of mechanisms that meet the given criteria. Release the setâ€™s memory using a call to gss_release_oid_set(_:_:) after you are done using it.

## Return Value

A status code set to GSS_S_COMPLETE on success. See Function Status for a complete enumeration of status outputs.
