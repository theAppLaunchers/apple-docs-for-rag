```

## Discussion

For offline compression, clients may set this property to kCFBooleanFalse, which indicates that it is OK for the video encoder to work slower than real time in order to produce a better result.

For real-time compression, clients may set this property to kCFBooleanTrue to recommend that encoding stay timely.

By default, this property is `NULL`, indicating unknown.
