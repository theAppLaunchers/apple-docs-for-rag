# VTFrameSilo

An object that stores sample buffers from a multipass encoding session.

## Overview

A frame silo object starts out empty and is populated by calls to VTFrameSiloAddSampleBuffer(_:sampleBuffer:) to add sample buffers in ascending decode order. After the first full pass, additional passes may be performed to replace sample buffers. Each such pass must begin with a call to VTFrameSiloSetTimeRangesForNextPass(_:timeRangeCount:timeRangeArray:), which takes a list of time ranges. Samples in these time ranges are deleted, and calls to VTFrameSiloAddSampleBuffer(_:sampleBuffer:) can then be made to provide replacements.

Call VTFrameSiloCallFunctionForEachSampleBuffer(_:in:refcon:callback:) or VTFrameSiloCallBlockForEachSampleBuffer(_:in:handler:) to retrieve sample buffers. The frame silo object may write sample buffers and data to the backing file between addition and retrieval; donâ€™t expect to get identical object pointers back.

The sample buffers are ordered by decode timestamp.

## Topics

### Creating Frame Silos

func VTFrameSiloCreate(allocator: CFAllocator?, fileURL: CFURL?, timeRange: CMTimeRange, options: CFDictionary?, frameSiloOut: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;VTFrameSilo?>) -> OSStatus

Creates a frame silo object using a temporary file.

### Configuring Frame Silos

func VTFrameSiloAddSampleBuffer(VTFrameSilo, sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer) -> OSStatus

Adds a sample buffer to a frame silo object.

func VTFrameSiloSetTimeRangesForNextPass(VTFrameSilo, timeRangeCount: CMItemCount, timeRangeArray: UnsafePointer&lt;CMTimeRange>) -> OSStatus

Begins a new pass of samples to be added to a frame silo object.

func VTFrameSiloCallBlockForEachSampleBuffer(VTFrameSilo, in: CMTimeRange, handler: (CMSampleBuffer) -> OSStatus) -> OSStatus

Retrieves sample buffers from a frame silo object.

func VTFrameSiloCallFunctionForEachSampleBuffer(VTFrameSilo, in: CMTimeRange, refcon: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, callback: (UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, CMSampleBuffer) -> OSStatus) -> OSStatus

Retrieves sample buffers from a frame silo object.

### Inspecting Frame Silos

func VTFrameSiloGetProgressOfCurrentPass(VTFrameSilo, progressOut: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;Float32>) -> OSStatus

Gets the progress of the current pass.

func VTFrameSiloGetTypeID() -> CFTypeID

Retrieves the Core Foundation type identifier for the frame silo object.
