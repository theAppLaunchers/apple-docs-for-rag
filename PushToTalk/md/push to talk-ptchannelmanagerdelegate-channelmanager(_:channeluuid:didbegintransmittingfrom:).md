## Mentioned in 

Creating a Push to Talk app

## Discussion

The system calls this method when the user begins pressing the talk button in the user interface, a programmatic transmit starts, or transmission begins from a hands-free accessory button press.

Important

Your app must wait for the system to call channelManager(_:didActivate:) before you begin recording audio from the user.
