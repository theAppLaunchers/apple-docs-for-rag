Important

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
class func channelManager(delegate: PTChannelManagerDelegate, restorationDelegate: PTChannelRestorationDelegate) async throws -> PTChannelManager
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

You must create a channel manager as soon as possible when launching your app so the system is able to restore existing challenge and deliver push notifications to your PTChannelManagerDelegate. By providing the restoration delegate, you decide whether to rejoin or leave any previously active channel the system knows about.
