Important

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

```
func setActiveRemoteParticipant(_ participant: PTParticipant?, channelUUID: UUID) async throws
```

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

When you receive incoming audio from a remote participant, set the participant value, which updates the system user interface and blocks transmission by the local user. When the user stops speaking, set the active participant to `nil`.
