iOS 4.0+iPadOS 4.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.8+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func predicateForEvents(
    withStart startDate: Date,
    end endDate: Date,
    calendars: [EKCalendar]?
) -> NSPredicate
```

## Parameters 

`startDate`  

The start date of the range of events fetched.

`endDate`  

The end date of the range of events fetched.

`calendars`  

An array of calendars to search, or `nil` to search all calendars.

## Return Value

A predicate to use when calling enumerateEvents(matching:using:) or events(matching:).

## Mentioned in 

Retrieving events and reminders

## Discussion

Use this method to create a predicate for use with events(matching:) or enumerateEvents(matching:using:). The events returned using this predicate are in the default time zone. For performance reasons, this method matches only those events within a four-year time span. If the date range between `startDate` and `endDate` is greater than four years, itâ€™s shortened to the first four years.
