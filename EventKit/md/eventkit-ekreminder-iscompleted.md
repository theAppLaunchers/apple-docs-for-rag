``` source
var isCompleted: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Setting this property to true will set completionDate to the current date; setting this property to false will set `completionDate` to `nil`.

### Special Considerations

If the reminder was completed using a different client, you may encounter the case where this property is true, but `completionDate` is `nil`.
