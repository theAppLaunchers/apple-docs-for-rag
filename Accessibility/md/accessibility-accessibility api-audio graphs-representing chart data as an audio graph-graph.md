# Representing chart data as an audio graph

Define accessible representations of your chart’s components for VoiceOver to construct an audible representation of the data.

## Overview

To represent your chart as an accessible audio graph, adopt the AXChart protocol on your chart’s view model. Set the accessibilityChartDescriptor property to an AXChartDescriptor that contains all the semantic information you need to represent your chart through an audio interface, like the chart’s title, axes, data points, and a summary of the chart’s key takeaways.

```
class MyChartView: UIView, AXChart {
    var accessibilityChartDescriptor: AXChartDescriptor?
}
```

For example, a chart that plots vehicle weight against fuel efficiency by country and MSRP has four data axes:

- The x-axis corresponds to the car’s weight in tons.

- The y-axis corresponds to the car’s fuel efficiency in MPG.

- The visual size of each data point corresponds to the car’s MSRP.

- The color of each data point corresponds to the car’s country of origin.

To create an audio graph of your chart, first set up a representation of each of your data points based on the information in your data model. Use that array of data points to create a *series descriptor*— a container that describes a collection of data points. Simple data sets might only have one series of data; more complex data sets might have multiple series.

```
let cars = generateData()

// Generate the data points from the model data.
let dataPoints = cars.map({
    return AXDataPoint(x: $0.weight,
                       y: $0.mpg,
        additionalValues: [.number($0.msrp), .category($0.country)],
                   label: "\($0.make) \($0.model)")
})

// Make the series descriptor.
let series = AXDataSeriesDescriptor(name: "Cars",
                            isContinuous: false,
                              dataPoints: dataPoints)
```

Next, set up descriptors for the chart’s axes. For numeric axes, use the valueDescriptionProvider closure to format the data values into string representations that include the units. Consider using a formatter, like NSNumberFormatter or NSDateFormatter, to generate strings that have more complex formats.

```
// Make the axis descriptors.
let weight = AXNumericDataAxisDescriptor(title: "Weight",
                                         range: 0...5,
                             gridlinePositions: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) { value -> String in
    let format = NSLocalizedString("%.2f tons",
                           comment: "Format string for values in tons")
    return String.localizedStringWithFormat(format, value)
}

let mpg = AXNumericDataAxisDescriptor(title: "Fuel Efficiency",
                                      range: 0...50,
                          gridlinePositions: [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]) { value -> String in
    let format = NSLocalizedString("%ld miles per gallon",
                           comment: "Format string for values in miles per gallon")
    return String.localizedStringWithFormat(format, value)
}

let msrp = AXNumericDataAxisDescriptor(title: "MSRP",
                                       range: 0...150000,
                           gridlinePositions: []) { value -> String in
    let format = NSLocalizedString("%ld MSRP",
                           comment: "Format string for MSRP values")
    return String.localizedStringWithFormat(format, value)
}

let country = AXCategoricalDataAxisDescriptor(title: "Country",
                                      categoryOrder: cars.compactMap{ $0.country })
```

To help provide context around the chart’s data, include a localized title and consider creating a summary that summarizes the key takeaways of the data in the chart.

```
// Write a localized title for the chart.
let title = NSLocalizedString("Vehicle Weight vs Fuel Efficiency by Country and MSRP",
                              comment: "Chart title for fuel efficiency vs mpg chart")

// Write a summary of the chart's data.
let summary = NSLocalizedString("The chart shows that fuel efficiency decreases as vehicle weight increases.",
                                comment: "Chart summary for fuel efficiency vs mpg chart")
```

Then, create your chart descriptor based on the individual descriptors of the chart’s components.

```
// Make and set the chart descriptor.
accessibilityChartDescriptor = AXChartDescriptor(title: title,
                                                 summary: summary,
                                                 xAxis: weight,
                                                 yAxis: mpg,
                                                 additionalAxes: [msrp, country],
                                                 series: [series])
```

The resulting chart descriptor produces an audio graph with weight as time, MPG as pitch, MSRP as tone length, and country of origin as timbre.
