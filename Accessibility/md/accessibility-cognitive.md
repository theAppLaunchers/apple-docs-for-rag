# Cognitive

A person may have difficulty remembering a sequence of steps, or they may find an overly complex user interface difficult to process and manage.

## Overview

People who have cognitive impairments or challenges with maintaining focus can use Appleâ€™s cognitive accessibility features to stay focused, streamline tasks, or limit the number of decisions to make. Design and develop your app to support cognitive accessibility features and provide a great experience for people who rely on these features.
