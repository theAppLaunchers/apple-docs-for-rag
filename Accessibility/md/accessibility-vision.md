# Vision

A person may be blind or color blind, or have a vision challenge that makes focusing difficult.

## Overview

People who are blind, have low vision, or prefer larger text can use Appleâ€™s vision accessibility features to customize their displays, control their devices, and navigate their surroundings. Design and develop your app to support vision accessibility features and provide a great experience for people who rely on these features.
