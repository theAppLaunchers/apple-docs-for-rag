## [Topics](/documentation/updates/wwdc2023#topics)

### [visionOS](/documentation/updates/wwdc2023#visionOS)

visionOS is a brand new platform that allows you to build immersive apps and games for spatial computing that run on Apple Vision Pro. Create new apps using SwiftUI to take full advantage of the spectrum of immersion available in visionOS. If you have an existing iPad or iPhone app, add the visionOS destination to your app’s target to gain access to the standard system appearance, and add platform-specific features to create a compelling experience.

### [SwiftData](/documentation/updates/wwdc2023#SwiftData)

Use SwiftData with SwiftUI to create a seamless connection from your data model to user interface. Like SwiftUI, SwiftData focuses entirely on code, with no external file formats to manage. Instead, it uses Swift’s new macro system to offer a streamlined API. SwiftData uses the `Codable` protocol to understand structures and enumerations, so you can model your data with the tools you already know. These types are fully modeled in the underlying data store, enabling you to perform fast and efficient queries, even on complex structured data.

[

SwiftData](/documentation/SwiftData)

Write your model code declaratively to add managed persistence and efficient model fetching.
