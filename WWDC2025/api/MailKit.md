# MailKit

Secure, customize, and act on email messages that users send and receive.

macOS 12.0+

## [Overview](/documentation/MailKit#overview)

MailKit lets your app include an app extension that customizes several features of Mail. A Mail app extension provides one or more of the following enhancements:

*   A _content blocker_ defines rules to prevent loading content when users view messages.
    
*   An _action handler_ performs actions such as flagging, setting colors, or archiving when Mail downloads messages.
    
*   A _compose session handler_ validates recipient email addresses, displays a view controller on Mailâ€™s compose windows, confirms if messages are suitable for delivery, and adds custom headers.
    
*   A _message security handler_ secures messages using encryption and digital signatures.
    

The entry point for your extension is an object that conforms to [`MEExtension`](/documentation/mailkit/meextension). When MailKit invokes your extension, this objects determines the handlers that provide each capability in the list above.
