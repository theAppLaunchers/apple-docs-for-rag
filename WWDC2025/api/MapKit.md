## [Overview](/documentation/MapKit#overview)

Use MapKit to give your app a sense of place with maps and location information. You can use the MapKit framework to:

*   Embed maps directly into your app’s windows and views.
    
*   Add annotations and overlays to a map to call out points of interest.
    
*   Add LookAround capabilities to enable users to explore locations at street level.
    
*   Respond to user interactions with well known points of interest, geographical features, and boundaries.
    
*   Provide text completion to make it easy for users to search for a destination or point of interest.
