# Discovering HID devices from Terminal

Identify devices connected to your Mac from the command line.

## [Overview](/documentation/CoreHID/DiscoveringHIDDevicesFromTerminal#Overview)

To interact with a human interface device (HID), you must identify what devices are available on your system. The `hidutil` command is a human interface device utility that you can use to probe a Mac for HID devices, monitor HID events, and to obtain device reports. Run `hidutil list` in Terminal (`/Applications/Utilities`) to receive a list of HID devices. The `Devices` portion of the output is relevant for discovering available human interface devices.

There are multiple entries with similar product names. Some products register as multiple devices to segment functionality that you match and interact with individually. For example, a device may have a keyboard and trackpad in the same form factor, but declare them as two separate components.

The `UsagePage` column contains the usage page, which is a category of broad functionality. In the above output, the usage page is either `1` or `65280`. According to [HID Usage Tables for Universal Serial Bus (USB)](https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_5.pdf), `65280 (0xFF00)` is a vendor-defined page and is reserved for the vendor to use as they see fit; therefore, ignore any entries with this page. Usage page `1` is the Generic Desktop page. Because both a keyboard and a mouse are Generic Desktop devices, you must further refine the search by examining the usage value.

Values in the `Usage` column relate to a category of specific functionality. In the output above, items with a usage page of `1` have a usage value of `2` or `6`, defined as a mouse or keyboard, respectively, according to [HID Usage Tables for Universal Serial Bus (USB)](https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_5.pdf).
