# Configuring attribution rules for your app

Tune aspects of attribution flow, including the time available to register impressions and the minimum time your app is willing to accept conversions.

## [Overview](/documentation/AdAttributionKit/configuring-attribution-rules-for-your-app#Overview)

AdAttributionKit provides a mechanism to configure the attribution rules that you change in your app by adding and configuring keys in the information property list file.

The structure of the AdAttributionKit additions to the information property list file include stanzas that you can use to control the duration of impressions that the system considers eligible for attribution for your app. You can also control the cooldown period — the minimum amount of time that needs to pass between conversions before the system accepts new conversions.

There are two main configuration sections:

*   The AttributionWindows settings that controls the time duration that impressions will be valid in your app.
    
*   The AttributionCooldown settings that allows your app to specify how often a conversion can happen.
    

Inside each of these sections are additional keys that that tune the behavior of their respective controls and allow you defined what ad networks they pertain to, or if they’re global settings.

## [Understand the AdAttributionKit configuration dictionary](/documentation/AdAttributionKit/configuring-attribution-rules-for-your-app#Understand-the-AdAttributionKit-configuration-dictionary)

AdAttributionKit uses your app’s information property list file to hold its configuration settings. To enable this configuration, add a new dictionary named `AdAttributionKitConfigurations` to the information property list file.

Inside this dictionary, you place additional dictionaries, or individual keys that control the attribution windows and cooldown periods, depending on your app’s requirements. To create the `AdAttributionKitConfigurations` dictionary, open your app’s Xcode project and follow these steps:

1.  Open your app’s project in Xcode.
    
2.  Go to the file navigator.
    
3.  Locate your app’s target, and select its filename.
    
4.  Click the app’s Info panel.
    
5.  Click the plus (+) button next to any existing entry to create a new element in the information property list file.
    
6.  Set the new element’s name to `AdAttributionKitConfigurations`.
    
7.  Click the Type menu for the new `AdAttributionKitConfigurations` element, and select `Dictionary` as its type.
    
8.  Click the disclosure triangle next to the `AdAttributionKitConfigurations` element to open it.
    

To complete the configuration, add one or more of the following addition-controlling elements, depending on the AdAttributionKit configuration you want to use with your app.

Note

For clarity, these examples show XML renderings of the dictionaries and keys that control the AdAttributionKit attribution windows and cooldown periods. In practice, use Xcode’s’ information property list editor to create and edit these settings.

## [Add an attribution windows dictionary](/documentation/AdAttributionKit/configuring-attribution-rules-for-your-app#Add-an-attribution-windows-dictionary)

You can specify the time duration that impressions are valid in your app by using configurable attribution windows. By default, view impressions are valid for 1 day after someone has seen them, and click impressions are valid for 30 days. With configurable attribution windows, you can specify a duration from 1 to 7 days for view impressions, and 1 to 30 days for click impressions.

To create configurations for individual or global ad networks, `AdAttributionKitConfigurations` needs a dictionary to contain them. To create this dictionary, follow these steps:

1.  Inside the new `AdAttributionKitConfigurations`, add a new element named `AttributionWindows`.
    
2.  Click the Type menu for the new `AttributionWindows` element, and set its type to `Dictionary`.
    
3.  Click the disclosure triangle next to the new `AttributionWindows` element to open it.
    

Your app can configure the attribution window globally, so that the framework applies it to all conversions, as well as on a per-ad network basis. This allows you to control the levels of granularity and define the attribution rules that make the most sense for your business. The system uses the following order of precedence for configurations: ad network > global > system default, where an ad network configuration always takes precedence over a global or system default configuration.

## [Configure your app’s global attribution window](/documentation/AdAttributionKit/configuring-attribution-rules-for-your-app#Configure-your-apps-global-attribution-window)

There are two types of global settings the attribution window settings support: _global settings_ that apply to ad networks, and _per-ad network settings_ that control specific parameters relating to conversions for the ad networks you specify.

To override the built-in, global attribution window settings, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new dictionary named `global` inside the `AttributionWindows` dictionary in your app’s information property list file.
    
2.  Inside this dictionary, create another, nested dictionary called `install`. This describes the kind of operation whose window you’re defining.
    
3.  Inside the `install` dictionary, you can specify numeric values for either `click` or `view` values. The click value determines the number of days that click impressions are valid for your app globally, with a range from `1` to `30` days. The view value determines the number of days that view impressions are valid for your app globally, with a range from `1` to `7` days. This example shows an XML rendering of a `global` dictionary inside the `AttributionWindows` dictionary that constrains `view` to `3` days:
    

```
    
```
<key>AdAttributionKitConfigurations</key>
    <dict>
        <key>AttributionWindows</key>
        <dict>
            <key>global</key>
            <dict>
                <key>install</key>
                <dict>
                    <key>view</key>
                    <integer>3</integer>
                </dict>
            </dict>
        </dict>
  </dict>
```

```

## [Configure attribution windows per ad network](/documentation/AdAttributionKit/configuring-attribution-rules-for-your-app#Configure-attribution-windows-per-ad-network)

You can also overwrite attribution windows for your app on a per-ad network basis, giving you more granular control of your app’s attribution windows for each partner you work with. To configure an attribution window for an ad network, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new dictionary named `AttributionWindows` inside of the `AdAttributionKitConfigurations` dictionary in your app’s information property list file.
    
2.  Add additional dictionaries to the `AttributionWindows` dictionary — one per ad network — to control the `click` and `view` windows for that network. These network-specific dictionaries need to have a key name that matches the ad network’s ID (for example, `test.adattributionkit`). For more information on ad network IDs, see [Registering an ad network](/documentation/AdAttributionKit/registering-an-ad-network).
    
3.  Inside this dictionary, add an `install` dictionary — following the same steps as for the `global` configuration — to control either the `click` or `view` duration. As with the `global` settings, this `install` dictionary needs to be inside the `AttributionWindows` dictionary.
    

The time ranges are the same as for the global install dictionary. This example shows an XML rendering of a dictionary for the ad network `test.adattributionkit`, constraining clicks to `23` days:

```
        
```
<key>AttributionWindows</key>
        <dict>
            <key>test.adattributionkit</key>
            <dict>
                <key>install</key>
                <dict>
                    <key>click</key>
                    <integer>23</integer>
                </dict>
            </dict>
        </dict>
```

```

Additionally, you can specify the key `ignoreInteractionType` inside the install dictionary. You can set the `ignoreInteractionType`key to `view` or `click`, which tells the system to ignore impressions with either a `view` or `click` ad interaction type from the specific ad network during attribution. This is useful for prioritizing either `view` or `click` attributions for your app when working with a specific ad network.

The following code shows an XML rendering of an `AdAttributionKitConfigurations` dictionary that contains `AttributionWindows` settings for both `global` and a specific ad network:

```
    
```
<key>AdAttributionKitConfigurations</key>
    <dict>
        <key>AttributionWindows</key>
        <dict>
            <key>global</key>
            <dict>
                <key>install</key>
                <dict>
                    <key>view</key>
                    <integer>3</integer>
                </dict>
            </dict>
            <key>com.apple.test.itms11.2</key>
            <dict>
                <key>install</key>
                <dict>
                    <key>ignoreInteractionType</key>
                    <string>view</string>
                    <key>click</key>
                    <integer>5</integer>
                </dict>
        </dict>
    </dict>
```

```

Important

You can only ignore an interaction type for ad network configurations. The system doesn’t recognize ignored interaction types in global configurations.

## [Configure attribution cooldown](/documentation/AdAttributionKit/configuring-attribution-rules-for-your-app#Configure-attribution-cooldown)

Configurable attribution cooldown allows your app to specify a duration after the last conversion in which the system won’t create any new conversions for your app. Consider the following scenario: someone installs your app from an ad, then within two hours taps another ad and re-engages back into your app. By default, the system creates a re-engagement conversion for the second tap, but your business model may consider the initial conversion as the more important signal. Configurable attribution cooldown allows you to specify a period in which the system ignores subsequent re-engagements.

You can specify a cooldown period for install conversions as well as re-engagement conversions. To specify a cooldown period after an install conversion, follow these steps:

1.  Define a dictionary with the key `AttributionCooldown` inside the `AdAttributionKitConfigurations` dictionary.
    
2.  Inside `AttributionCooldown`, add a new element with the name `install-cooldown-hours`.
    
3.  Using the Type menu, set its type to `Number`. This value represents the number of hours the system will wait after an install conversion before accepting new conversions.
    

This example shows an XML rendering of a dictionary for the `AttributionCooldown` that sets the installation cooldown period to 24 hours:

```
            
```
<key>AttributionCooldown</key>
            <dict>
                 <key>install-cooldown-hours</key>
                 <integer>24</integer>
            </dict>
```

```

Alternatively, you can specify a cooldown period after a re-engagement conversion. In this case, name the number key `re-engagement-cooldown-hours`. This value represents the number of hours the system waits after a re-engagement conversion before accepting new conversions.

The system accepts values with a range of `0` to `720` hours for both install and re-engagement cooldown periods.
