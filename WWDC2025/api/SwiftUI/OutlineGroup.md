Structure

# OutlineGroup

A structure that computes views and disclosure groups on demand from an underlying collection of tree-structured, identified data.

```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
struct OutlineGroup<Data, ID, Parent, Leaf, Subgroup> where Data : [`RandomAccessCollection`](/documentation/Swift/RandomAccessCollection), ID : [`Hashable`](/documentation/Swift/Hashable)
```
```
```
```
```
```

## [Overview](/documentation/SwiftUI/OutlineGroup#overview)

Use an outline group when you need a view that can represent a hierarchy of data by using disclosure views. This allows the user to navigate the tree structure by using the disclosure views to expand and collapse branches.

In the following example, a tree structure of `FileItem` data offers a simplified view of a file system. Passing the root of this tree and the key path of its children allows you to quickly create a visual representation of the file system.

```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
struct FileItem: Hashable, Identifiable, CustomStringConvertible {
```
```
    var id: Self { self }
    var name: String
    var children: [FileItem]? = nil
    var description: String {
        switch children {
        case nil:
            return "üìÑ \(name)"
        case .some(let children):
            return children.isEmpty ? "üìÇ \(name)" : "üìÅ \(name)"
        }
    }
}
```swift
```swift
let data =
```
```
  FileItem(name: "users", children:
    [FileItem(name: "user1234", children:
      [FileItem(name: "Photos", children:
        [FileItem(name: "photo001.jpg"),
         FileItem(name: "photo002.jpg")]),
       FileItem(name: "Movies", children:
         [FileItem(name: "movie001.mp4")]),
          FileItem(name: "Documents", children: [])
      ]),
     FileItem(name: "newuser", children:
       [FileItem(name: "Documents", children: [])
       ])
    ])
OutlineGroup(data, children: \.children) { item in
    Text("\(item.description)")
}
```
```
```
```

### [Type parameters](/documentation/SwiftUI/OutlineGroup#Type-parameters)

Five generic type constraints define a specific `OutlineGroup` instance:

*   `Data`: The type of a collection containing the children of an element in the tree-shaped data.
    
*   `ID`: The type of the identifier for an element.
    
*   `Parent`: The type of the visual representation of an element whose children property is non-`nil`
    
*   `Leaf`: The type of the visual representation of an element whose children property is `nil`.
    
*   `Subgroup`: A type of a view that groups a parent view and a view representing its children, typically with some mechanism for showing and hiding the children
    

## [Topics](/documentation/SwiftUI/OutlineGroup#topics)

### [Creating an outline group](/documentation/SwiftUI/OutlineGroup#Creating-an-outline-group)

[`init(_:children:)`](/documentation/swiftui/outlinegroup/init\(_:children:\))

Creates an outline group from a collection of root data elements and a key path to element‚Äôs children.

[`init(_:children:content:)`](/documentation/swiftui/outlinegroup/init\(_:children:content:\))

Creates an outline group from a binding to a collection of root data elements and a key path to its children.

[`init(_:id:children:content:)`](/documentation/swiftui/outlinegroup/init\(_:id:children:content:\))

Creates an outline group from a binding to a collection of root data elements, the key path to a data element‚Äôs identifier, and a key path to its children.

### [Supporting types](/documentation/SwiftUI/OutlineGroup#Supporting-types)

```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
struct OutlineSubgroupChildren
```
```

A type-erased view representing the children in an outline subgroup.
```
```

## [Relationships](/documentation/SwiftUI/OutlineGroup#relationships)

### [Conforms To](/documentation/SwiftUI/OutlineGroup#conforms-to)

*   [`Copyable`](/documentation/Swift/Copyable)
*   [`TableRowContent`](/documentation/swiftui/tablerowcontent)
    
    Conforms when `Data` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`, `ID` is `Data.Element.ID`, `Parent` conforms to `TableRowContent`, `Parent` is `Leaf`, `Leaf` is `Subgroup`, and `Data.Element` is `Parent.TableRowValue`.
    
*   [`View`](/documentation/swiftui/view)
    
    Conforms when `Data` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`, `ID` conforms to `Hashable`, `Parent` conforms to `View`, `Leaf` conforms to `View`, and `Subgroup` conforms to `View`.

### [Disclosing information progressively](/documentation/SwiftUI/OutlineGroup#Disclosing-information-progressively)

```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
struct DisclosureGroup
```
```

A view that shows or hides another content view, based on the state of a disclosure control.
```
```swift
```swift
```swift
func disclosureGroupStyle<S>(S) -> some View
```
```

Sets the style for disclosure groups within this view.
