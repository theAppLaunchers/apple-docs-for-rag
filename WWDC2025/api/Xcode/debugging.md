# Debugging

Identify and address issues in your app using the Xcode debugger, Xcode Organizer, Metal debugger, and Instruments.

## [Topics](/documentation/Xcode/debugging#topics)

### [Essentials](/documentation/Xcode/debugging#Essentials)

[

Diagnosing and resolving bugs in your running app](/documentation/xcode/diagnosing-and-resolving-bugs-in-your-running-app)

Inspect your app to isolate bugs, locate crashes, identify excess system-resource usage, visualize memory bugs, and investigate problems in its appearance.

### [Debugging strategies](/documentation/Xcode/debugging#Debugging-strategies)

[

Diagnosing issues in the appearance of a running app](/documentation/xcode/diagnosing-issues-in-the-appearance-of-your-running-app)

Inspect your running app to investigate issues in the appearance and placement of the content it displays.

[

API Reference

Diagnosing memory, thread, and crash issues early](/documentation/xcode/diagnosing-memory-thread-and-crash-issues-early)

Identify runtime crashes and undefined behaviors in your app during testing using Xcode’s sanitizer tools.

[

Analyzing HTTP traffic with Instruments](/documentation/Foundation/analyzing-http-traffic-with-instruments)

Measure HTTP-based network performance and usage of your apps.

[

Detecting when your app contacts domains that may be profiling users](/documentation/xcode/detecting-when-your-app-contacts-domains-that-may-be-profiling-users)

Use Instruments to assess whether your app or its third-party SDKs connect to domains that may profile users.

### [Graphics](/documentation/Xcode/debugging#Graphics)

[

API Reference

Metal developer workflows](/documentation/xcode/metal-developer-workflows)

Locate and fix issues related to your app’s use of the Metal API and GPU functions.

[

API Reference

Metal debugger](/documentation/xcode/metal-debugger)

Debug and profile your Metal workload with a GPU trace.

### [Breakpoints and variables](/documentation/Xcode/debugging#Breakpoints-and-variables)

[

Setting breakpoints to pause your running app](/documentation/xcode/setting-breakpoints-to-pause-your-running-app)

Specify where your app pauses when running the debugger to investigate bugs.

[

Stepping through code and inspecting variables to isolate bugs](/documentation/xcode/stepping-through-code-and-inspecting-variables-to-isolate-bugs)

Find the cause of your bugs by watching variables change as you step through your source code in the debugger.

### [Reports](/documentation/Xcode/debugging#Reports)

[

Building your app to include debugging information](/documentation/xcode/building-your-app-to-include-debugging-information)

Configure Xcode to produce the symbol information for debugging and crash reports.

[

API Reference

Diagnosing issues using crash reports and device logs](/documentation/xcode/diagnosing-issues-using-crash-reports-and-device-logs)

Use crash reports and device logs to debug app issues.

### [Entitlements](/documentation/Xcode/debugging#Entitlements)

[

Diagnosing Issues with Entitlements](/documentation/BundleResources/diagnosing-issues-with-entitlements)

Verify your app’s entitlements at every stage of development to track down errors during distribution.
