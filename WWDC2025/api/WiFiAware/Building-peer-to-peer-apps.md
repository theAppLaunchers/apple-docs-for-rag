## [Overview](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Overview)

This sample app uses the Wi-Fi Aware framework to build a peer-to-peer app. One device acts as a publisher by running a local simulation and advertising a service. Nearby devices connect to the publisher and subscribe to the simulation movements. The Wi-Fi Aware framework provides a secure, low-latency connection between the publisher and connected devices.

The sample app shows the interactions between the publisher and subscriber devices. The publisher simulates a satellite orbiting a planet. It sends the satellite’s coordinates to connected subscriber devices. The subscribers receive the coordinates for each frame on the publisher simulation and update their local satellite’s position, mirroring the publisher’s.

### [Configure the sample code project](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Configure-the-sample-code-project)

Because this sample app relies on using Wi-Fi Aware to make a network connection between devices, you can’t run this sample in Simulator — you’ll need to run it on physical devices.

### [Launch and run the app](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Launch-and-run-the-app)

1.  Launch the app on two nearby devices.
    
2.  Tap Host Simulation on one device to start it in publisher mode.
    
3.  Tap View Simulation on the other device to start it in subscriber mode.
    
4.  Pair the devices.
    
    *   Tap Add Device on both devices.
        
    *   On the subscriber device, select the publisher device to pair with, and follow the on-screen steps to complete the pairing.
        
    *   After the pairing is complete, each device shows the other device under the _Paired Devices_ section. Dismiss the pairing views on both devices.
        
5.  Connect the devices.
    
    *   On the publisher device, tap Advertise.
        
    *   On the subscriber device, tap Find & Connect.
        

The devices then make a Wi-Fi Aware connection, and the satellite position on the subscriber device mirrors that of the one on the publisher. You can control the position of the satellite on the publisher device by tapping on it and moving it around, and you can observe the position of the satellite on the subscriber devices mirroring the one on the publisher device.

### [Authorize the app to publish and subscribe](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Authorize-the-app-to-publish-and-subscribe)

The sample app can use the Wi-Fi Aware framework with the addition of the [`com.apple.developer.wifi-aware`](/documentation/BundleResources/Entitlements/com.apple.developer.wifi-aware) entitlement as a capability array. To enable the sample app to perform publish and subscribe operations, add `Publish` and `Subscribe` strings to the capability array:

```

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.developer.wifi-aware</key>
    <array>
        <string>Publish</string>
        <string>Subscribe</string>
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

```

### [Declare and access services](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Declare-and-access-services)

For an app to perform any Wi-Fi Aware operations, it needs to declare the services that it intends to use for publishing and subscribing. The sample app declares the _\_sat-simulation.\_udp_ service in its `Info.plist` with `Publishable` and `Subscribable` keys:

```

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>WiFiAwareServices</key>
    <dict>
        <key>_sat-simulation._udp</key>
        <dict>
            <key>Publishable</key>
            <dict/>
            <key>Subscribable</key>
            <dict/>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```

```

For convenience, the app creates extensions to the [`WAPublishableService`](/documentation/wifiaware/wapublishableservice) and [`WASubscribableService`](/documentation/wifiaware/wasubscribableservice) classes for the service it uses to publish and subscribe:

```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
let simulationServiceName = "_sat-simulation._udp"
```
```
extension WAPublishableService {
    public static var simulationService: WAPublishableService {
        allServices[simulationServiceName]!
    }
}
extension WASubscribableService {
    public static var simulationService: WASubscribableService {
        allServices[simulationServiceName]!
    }
}
```
```
```
```

### [Pair devices to connect](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Pair-devices-to-connect)

To set up a connection between devices, you need to pair the devices. Both the [DeviceDiscoveryUI](/documentation/DeviceDiscoveryUI) and [AccessorySetupKit](/documentation/AccessorySetupKit) frameworks work for pairing. The sample app uses `DeviceDiscoveryUI` to pair devices.

To start a browser that can discover nearby devices, the app uses the [`DevicePicker`](/documentation/DeviceDiscoveryUI/DevicePicker) view, providing it with an empty device list and `simulationService` as the service:

```

```
DevicePicker(.wifiAware(.connecting(to: .selected([]), from: .simulationService))) { endpoint in
    logger.info("Paired Endpoint: \(endpoint)")
} label: {
    Image(systemName: "plus")
    Text("Add Device")
} fallback: {
    Image(systemName: "xmark.circle")
    Text("Unavailable")
}
```

```

To start a listener that allows nearby devices to discover and pair, the app uses [`DevicePairingView`](/documentation/DeviceDiscoveryUI/DevicePairingView) with `simulationService` as the service and an empty device list:

```

```
DevicePairingView(.wifiAware(.connecting(to: .simulationService, from: .selected([])))) {
    Image(systemName: "plus")
    Text("Add Device")
} fallback: {
    Image(systemName: "xmark.circle")
    Text("Unavailable")
}
```

```

To perform pairing, tap the `Add Devices` button in the app on the two devices, one running in publisher mode and the other in subscriber mode.

### [Access paired devices](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Access-paired-devices)

The sample app declares a `@State` variable to display the currently available paired devices ([`WAPairedDevice`](/documentation/wifiaware/wapaireddevice) instances) using a List view:

```swift

```swift
@State var pairedDevices: [WAPairedDevice] = []
```

```

The app keeps track of currently paired devices that it has access to by iterating over the async sequence provided by [`allDevices`](/documentation/wifiaware/wapaireddevice/alldevices).

```

```
do {
    for try await updatedDeviceList in WAPairedDevice.allDevices {
        pairedDevices = Array(updatedDeviceList.values)
    }
} catch {
    logger.error("Failed to get paired devices: \(error)")
}
```

```

### [Consider performance](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Consider-performance)

Before using Wi-Fi Aware in an app, it’s important to decide on the [`WAPerformanceMode`](/documentation/wifiaware/waperformancemode) to use for the connections. The first option is [`WAPerformanceMode.bulk`](/documentation/wifiaware/waperformancemode/bulk), the recommended option for almost all use cases. The second option is [`WAPerformanceMode.realtime`](/documentation/wifiaware/waperformancemode/realtime), which is for instances that require low latency. The sample app uses `realtime` as it needs to send position updates roughly once very 16 ms and thus requires very low latency.

Changing the performance mode from `realtime` to `bulk` in the app demonstrates the difference between the two modes. To change the performance mode in the sample app, change the following line in `NetworkConfig.swift`:

```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
let appPerformanceMode: WAPerformanceMode = .realtime
```
```
// Change the performance mode.
```swift
```swift
let appPerformanceMode: WAPerformanceMode = .bulk
```
```
```
```
```
```

Important

Using `realtime` performance mode can drain a device’s battery, so use it only when it’s required.

In addition to setting the performance mode to `realtime`, the app also sets the traffic service class to `interactiveVideo` to achieve better prioritization of traffic resuling in lower latency. Experiment with changing the traffic service class in `NetworkConfig.swift`.

```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
let appAccessCategory: WAAccessCategory = .interactiveVideo
```
```
// Change the traffic service class.
```swift
```swift
let appAccessCategory: WAAccessCategory = .bestEffort
```
```
```
```
```
```

### [Publish and subscribe with the Network framework](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Publish-and-subscribe-with-the-Network-framework)

The sample app uses the [Network](/documentation/Network) framework to publish and subscribe. The Wi-Fi Aware framework implements the [`ListenerProvider`](/documentation/Network/ListenerProvider) and [`BrowserProvider`](/documentation/Network/BrowserProvider) protocols in the Network framework. It creates a network listener and browser using [`NetworkListener`](/documentation/Network/NetworkListener) and [`NetworkBrowser`](/documentation/Network/NetworkBrowser), respectively. Running these instances results in Wi-Fi Aware publish and subscribe operations. After the app discovers the network endpoints, it creates a Wi-Fi Aware connection using [`NetworkConnection`](/documentation/Network/NetworkConnection).

### [Publish a service](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Publish-a-service)

To start publishing, the app creates a `NetworkListener` instance by providing it `simulationService` as the service to advertise, and specifying the paired devices allowed to connect. In the sample app, [`allPairedDevices`](/documentation/wifiaware/wapublisherlistener/devices/allpaireddevices) allows a connection from any paired device. Using [`selected(_:)`](/documentation/wifiaware/wapublisherlistener/devices/selected\(_:\)-56vig) limits connections to a smaller subset of devices, and using [`matching(_:)`](/documentation/wifiaware/wapublisherlistener/devices/matching\(_:\)) provides a predicate filter on `WAPairedDevice`.

```

```
try await NetworkListener(for:
    .wifiAware(.connecting(to: .simulationService, from: .allPairedDevices)),
using: .parameters {
    Coder(receiving: NetworkEvent.self, sending: NetworkEvent.self, using: NetworkJSONCoder()) {
        UDP()
    }
}
.wifiAware { $0.performanceMode = appPerformanceMode }
.serviceClass(appServiceClass))
.onStateUpdate { listener, state in
    logger.info("\(String(describing: listener)) : \(String(describing: state))")
    // Process the listener state update.
}
.run { connection in
    logger.info("Incoming Connection: \(String(describing: connection))")
    
    // Handle the incoming connection.
}
```

```

Note

The sample app uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the transport protocol because the use case doesn’t require reliable or in-order delivery. For most cases, using a protocol like the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) would likely be a better option.

### [Subscribe to a service](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Subscribe-to-a-service)

To start subscribing, the app creates a `NetworkBrowser` instance by providing it `simulationService` as the service, and specifying the paired devices that it can discover.

```

```
try await NetworkBrowser(for:
    .wifiAware(.connecting(to: .allPairedDevices, from: .simulationService))
)
.onStateUpdate { browser, state in
    logger.info("\(String(describing: browser)) : \(String(describing: state))")
    // Process the browser state update.
}
.run { waEndpoints in
    logger.info("Discovered: \(waEndpoints)")
    // Make a connection.
}
```

```

### [Make a connection](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Make-a-connection)

The sample app uses the Network framework to make a connection. For convenience, the app declares a type alias `WiFiAwareConnection` for a parameterized [`NetworkConnection`](/documentation/Network/NetworkConnection), and a [`Codable`](/documentation/Swift/Codable) and [`Sendable`](/documentation/Swift/Sendable) enumeration to encode and send satellite position coordinates over the connection.

```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
typealias WiFiAwareConnection = NetworkConnection<Coder<NetworkEvent, NetworkEvent, NetworkJSONCoder>>
```
```
public enum NetworkEvent: Codable, Sendable {
    case startStreaming
    case satelliteMovedTo(position: CGPoint, dimensions: CGSize)
}
```
```
```
```

On the publisher side, the sample app receives incoming connections in the `run` closure attached to the `NetworkListener`. As it receives new connections, the app sets up the state update handler and holds a reference to the connection instance.

```

```
connection.onStateUpdate { connection, state in
    logger.info("\(String(describing: connection)) : \(String(describing: state))")
    
    // Process the connection state update.
}
```

```

On the subscriber side, the `WAEndpoint` instances the app receives from the `NetworkBrowser` are connectable when the app passes them to the `NetworkConnection`. To set up a connection to a discovered endpoint using `NetworkConnection`, the app provides the endpoint of interest and sets the Wi-Fi Aware performance mode and traffic service class. It also sets up a connection state update handler similar to the publisher.

The sample app connects to the first endpoint that’s discovered, provides the _\_sat-simulation.\_udp_ service, and stops the browser after making the first connection. Although this particular design of connecting to the first available endpoint works for the sample app’s use case, most apps typically review the discovered endpoint and make a connection only if required.

```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
let connection = NetworkConnection(
```
```
    to:
        endpoint,
    using: .parameters {
        Coder(receiving: NetworkEvent.self, sending: NetworkEvent.self, using: NetworkJSONCoder()) {
            UDP()
        }
    }
    .wifiAware { $0.performanceMode = appPerformanceMode }
    .serviceClass(appServiceClass)
)
connection.onStateUpdate { connection, state in
    logger.info("\(connection.debugDescription): \(String(describing: state))")
    
    // Process the connection state update.
}
```
```
```
```

Note

The `WAPerformanceMode` setting provided during connection should match the one the app provides when starting the listener. Mismatched performance modes lead to an undefined behavior.

### [Send data to connected devices](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Send-data-to-connected-devices)

The publisher instance of the sample app sends the coordinates of the _satellite_ in the local simulation to all connected devices, for every frame:

```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
```swift
func send(_ event: NetworkEvent, to connection: WiFiAwareConnection) async {
```
```
    do {
        try await connection.send(event)
    } catch {
        logger.error("Failed to send to: \(connection.debugDescription): \(error)")
    }
}
```swift
```swift
func sendToAll(_ event: NetworkEvent) async {
```
```
    for connection in connections {
        await send(event, to: connection)
    }
}
```
```
```
```

### [Receive data from the connected device](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Receive-data-from-the-connected-device)

To receive data over the connection, the app uses the `Network` framework APIs available in the [`NetworkConnection`](/documentation/Network/NetworkConnection) instance:

```

```
for try await (event, _) in connection.messages {
    // Process the incoming message and update the satellite position using the received coordinates.
}
```

```

The sample app instance running on the subscriber side receives the coordinates of the satellite as it moves in the publisher simulation. It then updates the position of the local satellite based on the coordinates it receives.

### [Monitor connection performance](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Monitor-connection-performance)

The sample app uses the Wi-Fi Aware framework to monitor the performance of connections to peer devices. It gets the `WAPairedDevice` representing the remote endpoint and the current performance report of the connection by accessing the [`currentPath`](/documentation/Network/NetworkConnection/currentPath) property of the connection. The app accesses the [`WAPerformanceReport`](/documentation/wifiaware/waperformancereport) through the `.wifiAware` extension to `currentPath`, which contains Wi-Fi Aware-specific connection performance information:

```swift

```swift
if let wifiAwarePath = try await connection.currentPath?.wifiAware {
    let connectedDevice = wifiAwarePath.endpoint.device
    let performanceReport = wifiAwarePath.performance
    // Use the performance report.
}
```

```

The app displays two performance attributes for each connected device: signal strength and transmit latency.

### [Get the signal strength](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Get-the-signal-strength)

Signal strength, represented as a number between `0.0` and `1.0`, is present in the [`WAPerformanceReport`](/documentation/wifiaware/waperformancereport) instance. A number closer to `1.0` indicates a stronger signal strength.

```

```
performanceReport.signalStrength
```

```

### [Get the transmit latency](/documentation/WiFiAware/Building-peer-to-peer-apps#Get-the-transmit-latency)

The Wi-Fi Aware framework reports the measured transmit latency of packets sent to a paired device, per access category (`WAAccessCategory`). Each `NetworkConnection` is bound to a specific `WAAccessCategory` based on the `serviceClass` configuration that was provided during the creation of the connection instance. In case of the sample app, the publisher specifies [`interactiveVideo`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwparameters/serviceclass-swift.enum/interactivevideo) as the service class to transmit packets to the subscribers. To access the average transmit latency for the corresponding access category, use the following code:

```

```
performanceReport.transmitLatency[appAccessCategory]?.average
```

```
