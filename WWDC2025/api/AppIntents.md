Framework

# App Intents

Make your app’s content and actions discoverable with system experiences like Spotlight, widgets, and the Shortcuts app.

## [Overview](/documentation/AppIntents#Overview)

The App Intents framework provides functionality to deeply integrate your app’s actions and content with system experiences across platforms, including Siri, Spotlight, widgets, controls and more. With Apple Intelligence and enhancements to App Intents, Siri will suggest your app’s actions to help people discover your app’s features and gains the ability to take actions in and across apps.

By adopting the App Intents framework, you allow people to personalize their devices by instantly using your app’s functionality with:

*   Interactions with Siri, including those that use the personal context awareness and action capabilities of Apple Intelligence.
    
*   Spotlight suggestions and search.
    
*   Actions and automations in the Shortcuts app.
    
*   Hardware interactions that initiate app actions, like the Action button and squeeze gestures on Apple Pencil.
    
*   Focus to allow people to reduce distractions.
    

Note

Siri’s personal context understanding, onscreen awareness, and in-app actions are in development and will be available with a future software update.

For example, App Intents enables you to express your app’s actions, by offering an App Shortcut. People can then ask Siri to take those actions on their behalf, whether they’re in your app or elsewhere in the system. Use App Entities to expose content in your app to Spotlight and semantic indexing with Apple Intelligence. People can then ask Siri to retrieve information from your app, like asking Siri to pull up flight information from a travel app to share with a loved one.

You reuse these components with other technologies to offer additional features and experiences that make your app and its functionality even more discoverable and widely available. For example, you reuse modular App Intents code together with [WidgetKit](/documentation/WidgetKit) to offer:

*   Interactive widgets
    
*   Controls
    
*   Live Activities
