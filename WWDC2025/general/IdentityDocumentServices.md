# IdentityDocumentServices

Share mobile documents using the Digital Credentials API.

iOS 26.0+BetaiPadOS 26.0+BetamacOS 26.0+Beta

## [Overview](/documentation/IdentityDocumentServices#overview)

Identity Document Services enables the presentment of identity documents on device and web browser support for the Digital Credentials API. Once authorized, a person can select your app during a identity documents request, where they can authorize the presentment of identification through a UI you create with [IdentityDocumentServicesUI](/documentation/IdentityDocumentServicesUI).

This framework also enables web browsers to implement the presentment flow for the Digital Credentials API. With web browser support, a person can present identity documents locally on their device or remotely on another device using the same iCloud account. Identity documents can include documents such as a driverâ€™s license or identity card.
