# Accessibility

Make your apps accessible to everyone who uses Apple devices.

iOS 14.0+iPadOS 14.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+macOS 11.0+tvOS 14.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 7.0+

## [Overview](/documentation/Accessibility#overview)

Accessibility features help a wide range of people interact with their devices. By creating your app with accessibility in mind, you make it possible for everyone to enjoy your app. Whether you’re developing a new app, or updating an existing one, consider the needs of all the people who might use your app.

For many, accessibility is a necessity. For others, it’s a practicality. For example, closed captions can be necessary for someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, but also useful for someone watching a video in a noisy environment. Learn more about how to support different types of accessibility needs in your app using Apple’s wide range of accessibility APIs.

### [Add Accessibility Nutrition Labels to your product page](/documentation/Accessibility#Add-Accessibility-Nutrition-Labels-to-your-product-page)

You can add Accessibility Nutrition Labels to your App Store product page to indicate which accessibility features your app supports on each platform. For example, a person who is blind or has low vision might seek apps that support VoiceOver or Larger Text.

For more information on adding Accessibility Nutrition Labels to your app, see [Overview of Accessibility Nutrition Labels](https://devcms.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels) in App Store Connect Help.
