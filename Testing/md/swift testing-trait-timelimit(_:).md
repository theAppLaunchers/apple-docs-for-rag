Type Method

# timeLimit(\_:)

Construct a time limit trait that causes a test to time out if it runs for too long.

``` source
static func timeLimit(_ timeLimit: TimeLimitTrait.Duration) -> Self
```

Available when `Self` is `TimeLimitTrait`.

## Parameters 

`timeLimit`  

The maximum amount of time the test may run for.

## Return Value

An instance of TimeLimitTrait.

## Mentioned in 

Limiting the running time of tests

## Discussion

Test timeouts do not support high-precision, arbitrarily short durations due to variability in testing environments. The time limit must be at least one minute, and can only be expressed in increments of one minute.

When this trait is associated with a test, that test must complete within a time limit of, at most, `timeLimit`. If the test runs longer, an issue of kind Issue.Kind.timeLimitExceeded(timeLimitComponents:) is recorded. This timeout is treated as a test failure.

The time limit amount specified by `timeLimit` may be reduced if the testing library is configured to enforce a maximum per-test limit. When such a maximum is set, the effective time limit of the test this trait is applied to will be the lesser of `timeLimit` and that maximum. This is a policy which may be configured on a global basis by the tool responsible for launching the test process. Refer to that toolâ€™s documentation for more details.

If a test is parameterized, this time limit is applied to each of its test cases individually. If a test has more than one time limit associated with it, the shortest one is used. A test run may also be configured with a maximum time limit per test case.
