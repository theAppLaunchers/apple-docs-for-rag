## Mentioned in 

Creating a Message Filter App Extension

## Overview

A Message Filter app extension that adopts this protocol forms a response about the message described in the query, based on information that it either stores locally or receives from an associated network service.

When the app extension defers a query request to a server, the system handles all network communication, passing the request to the server and passing the serverâ€™s response back to the app extension.
