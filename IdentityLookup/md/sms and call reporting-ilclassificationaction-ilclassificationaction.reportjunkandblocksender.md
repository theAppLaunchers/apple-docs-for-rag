## Discussion

The extension creates an SMS message based on the response, and displays the message to the user. The user can then send or cancel the report.

Next, the extension displays an alert to notify the user that the number will be blocked. To unblock the number, users must go to the Call Blocking & Identification settings in the Settings app.

Finally, the extension dismisses the ILClassificationUIExtensionViewController.
