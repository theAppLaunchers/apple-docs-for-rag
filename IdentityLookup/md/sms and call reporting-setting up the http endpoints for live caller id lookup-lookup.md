# Setting up the HTTP endpoints for Live Caller ID Lookup

Connect the on-device system to your server.

## Overview

For the Live Caller ID Lookup extension, your client-side app needs your serviceURL so the system can fetch information from your server. Communication between the system and the server uses protocol buffer messages over HTTP. For more information, see Homomorphic Encryption Protobuf.

Implement your server with the following HTTP endpoints:

- `/config`

- `/key`

- `/queries`

### Get configuration and status

The system calls the configuration endpoint periodically to get information about the use case configuration and evaluation key status. Set up the following `/config` endpoint by posting to `/config`:

| Request | Value | Description |
|----|----|----|
| Header | `User-Identifier` | A pseudorandom identifier for the user. |
| Header | `Authorization` | The value that contains a private access token. |
| Request body | `ConfigRequest` | A serialized protocol buffer message. |
| Response | `ConfigResponse` | A serialized protocol buffer message. The `ConfigResponse` contains the `configs` and `key_info` response fields. |
| Response field | `configs` | A field that maps from the use case names to the corresponding configuration. |
| Response field | `key_info` | A list of the `KeyStatus` objects. |

### Upload the evaluation key

You store the evaluation key on your server. When the system detects a new evaluation key, it uses the `/key` endpoint to upload it. Set up the following `/key` endpoint to upload an evaluation key by posting to `/key`:

| Request | Value | Description |
|----|----|----|
| Header | `User-Identifier` | A pseudorandom identifier for the user. |
| Header | `Authorization` | The value that contains a private access token. |
| Request body | `EvaluationKeys` | A serialized protocol buffer message. |

### Update PIR requests

The system updates your private information retrieval (PIR) request through the `/queries` endpoint. Set up the `/queries` endpoint to evaluate PIR requests.

| Request | Value | Description |
|----|----|----|
| Header | `User-Identifier` | A pseudorandom identifier for the user. This value looks up the previously stored evaluation key and uses it to evaluate the PIR request. |
| Header | `Authorization` | The value that contains a private access token. |
| Request body | `Requests` | A serialized protocol buffer message. |
| Response | `Responses` | A serialized protocol buffer message. |
