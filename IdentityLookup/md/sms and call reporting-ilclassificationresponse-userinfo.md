## Discussion

Use this property if you set the `ILClassificationExtensionNetworkReportDestination` key in the extensionâ€™s `Info.plist` file. The property stores any additional data that you want to pass to your servers as part of the response. Both the keys and values must be JSON-serializable. For more information, see NSJSONSerialization.
