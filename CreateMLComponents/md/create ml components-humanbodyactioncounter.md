Counting human body action repetitions in a live video feed

Use Create ML Components to analyze a series of video frames and count a personâ€™s repetitive or periodic body movements.

struct Pose

A pose that contains joint keypoints from a person, a hand, or a combination.

struct JointKey

A key that uniquely identifies a joint.

struct JointPoint

A joint in a pose that contains a location and scoring information.

struct PoseSelector

A transformer that selects one pose from an array of poses.

enum PoseSelectionStrategy

Pose selection strategy.

struct JointsSelector

Joints selector from a pose.

struct HumanBodyPoseExtractor

The human body pose image feature extractor.

struct HumanHandPoseExtractor

The human hand pose image feature extractor.

struct HumanBodyActionPeriodPredictor

A human body action period predictor transformer that takes window of poses and produces a window of predictions.
