# ComposedTransformer

A transformer that composes two transformers by applying them one after the other.

``` source
struct ComposedTransformer where Inner : Transformer, Outer : Transformer, Inner.Output == Outer.Input
```

## Overview

The inner transformerâ€™s output must match the outer transformer input. The result of this transformer is equivalent to invoking `outer(inner(x))` on an input `x`,

## Topics

### Creating the transformer

init(Inner, Outer)

Creates a transformer composition from two transformers.

### Getting the properties

var inner: Inner

The inner transformer.

var outer: Outer

The outer transformer.

### Performing the transformation

func applied(to: ComposedTransformer&lt;Inner, Outer>.Input, eventHandler: EventHandler?) async throws -> ComposedTransformer&lt;Inner, Outer>.Output

Performs the composed transformation on a single input.

typealias Input

The input type.

typealias Intermediate

The intermediate type.

typealias Output

The output type.
