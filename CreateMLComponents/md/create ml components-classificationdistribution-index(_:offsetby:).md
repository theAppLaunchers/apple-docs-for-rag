``` source
func index(
    _ i: Self.Index,
    offsetBy distance: Int
) -> Self.Index
```

## Parameters 

`i`  

A valid index of the collection.

`distance`  

The distance to offset `i`. `distance` must not be negative unless the collection conforms to the `BidirectionalCollection` protocol.

## Return Value

An index offset by `distance` from the index `i`. If `distance` is positive, this is the same value as the result of `distance` calls to `index(after:)`. If `distance` is negative, this is the same value as the result of `abs(distance)` calls to `index(before:)`.

## Discussion

The following example obtains an index advanced four positions from a stringâ€™s starting index and then prints the character at that position.

```
let s = "Swift"
let i = s.index(s.startIndex, offsetBy: 4)
print(s[i])
// Prints "t"
```

The value passed as `distance` must not offset `i` beyond the bounds of the collection.

Complexity

O(1) if the collection conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`; otherwise, O(*k*), where *k* is the absolute value of `distance`.
