Instance Property

# maximumIterationCount

The maximum number of allowed passes through the data.

iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+tvOS 18.0+visionOS 2.0+watchOS 11.0+

``` source
var maximumIterationCount: Int
```

## Discussion

More passes over the data can result in a more accurately trained model. Consider increasing this if the training accuracy is low. Defaults to 25.

Note

This parameter is only used by the `fitted` method. When using the `update` method itâ€™s up to you to decide when to stop.
