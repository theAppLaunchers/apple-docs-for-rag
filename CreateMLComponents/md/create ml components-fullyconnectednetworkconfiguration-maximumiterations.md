## Discussion

More iterations will produce better models as long as there is no over-fitting. Over-fitting happens when the dropout probability is too low or there is not enough training data.

Note

This parameter is only used by the `fitted` method. When using the `update` method itâ€™s up to you to decide when to stop.
