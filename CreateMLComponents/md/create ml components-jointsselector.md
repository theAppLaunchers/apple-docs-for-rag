```

## Topics

### Creating a selector

init(ignoredJoints: [JointKey])

Creates a joint selector transformer using a list of joint keys to be ignored.

init(selectedJoints: [JointKey])

Creates a joint selector transformer using a list of joint keys to be selected.

### Getting the properties

var ignoredJoints: [JointKey]?

A list of joint keys to be ignored.

var selectedJoints: [JointKey]?

A list of joint keys to be selected.

### Performing the selector

func applied(to: Pose, eventHandler: EventHandler?) -> Pose

Select joints to be included in the pose. Ignored joints will be reset to zero in all fields.

### Type Aliases

typealias Input

The input type.

typealias Output

The output type.

struct JointKey

A key that uniquely identifies a joint.

struct JointPoint

A joint in a pose that contains a location and scoring information.

struct PoseSelector

A transformer that selects one pose from an array of poses.

enum PoseSelectionStrategy

Pose selection strategy.

struct HumanBodyPoseExtractor

The human body pose image feature extractor.

struct HumanHandPoseExtractor

The human hand pose image feature extractor.

struct HumanBodyActionCounter

A human body action repetition counting transformer that takes window of human body poses and produces cumulative human body action repetition counts.

struct HumanBodyActionPeriodPredictor

A human body action period predictor transformer that takes window of poses and produces a window of predictions.
