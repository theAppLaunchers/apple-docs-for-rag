struct JointKey

A key that uniquely identifies a joint.

struct JointPoint

A joint in a pose that contains a location and scoring information.

struct PoseSelector

A transformer that selects one pose from an array of poses.

enum PoseSelectionStrategy

Pose selection strategy.

struct JointsSelector

Joints selector from a pose.

struct HumanBodyPoseExtractor

The human body pose image feature extractor.

struct HumanHandPoseExtractor

The human hand pose image feature extractor.

struct HumanBodyActionCounter
