Instance Property

# minimumLossReduction

Minimum loss reduction required to further split a node during the tree learning phase.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 11.0+

``` source
var minimumLossReduction: Double
```

## Discussion

Larger values can help prevent overfitting by avoiding splits that do not sufficiently reduce the loss function. Defaults to 0.
