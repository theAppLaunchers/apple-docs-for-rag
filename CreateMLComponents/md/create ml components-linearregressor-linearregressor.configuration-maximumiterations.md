Instance Property

# maximumIterations

The maximum number of allowed passes through the data.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 11.0+

``` source
var maximumIterations: Int
```

## Discussion

More passes over the data can result in a more accurately trained model. Consider increasing this if the training accuracy is low. Defaults to 25.

Note

This parameter is only used by the `fitted` method. When using the `update` method itâ€™s up to you to decide when to stop.
