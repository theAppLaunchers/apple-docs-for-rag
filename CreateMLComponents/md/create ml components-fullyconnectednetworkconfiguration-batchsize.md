# batchSize

The number of examples to use per mini-batch.

``` source
var batchSize: Int
```

## Discussion

A larger batch size will speed up computation when training, as long as the batch fits in memory.

Note

This parameter is only used by the `fitted` method. When using the `update` method itâ€™s up to you to do batching.
