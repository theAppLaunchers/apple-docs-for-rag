## Topics

### Creating a pose

init(VNRecognizedPointsObservation) throws

Creates a pose from a body or hand pose observation.

init(from: [JointKey : JointPoint])

Creates a pose from a dictionary of joint keypoints.

### Getting the key points

var keypoints: [JointKey : JointPoint]

A dictionary of all keypoints in the pose

### Computing the bounding box

func boundingBoxArea(confidenceThreshold: Float) -> Float

Computes the bounding box area of the pose.
