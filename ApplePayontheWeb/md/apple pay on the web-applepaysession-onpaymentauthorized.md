## Discussion

This attribute must be set to a function that accepts an `events` argument; for example, `session.onpaymentauthorized = function(event) {}`.

The event parameter contains the payment (ApplePayPayment) attribute.

The onpaymentauthorized function must complete the payment and respond by calling completePayment before the 30 second timeout, after which a message appears stating that the payment couldnâ€™t be completed.
