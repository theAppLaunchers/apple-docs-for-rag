## Discussion

Provide this object to update the recurringPaymentRequest value in the original ApplePayPaymentRequest, if necessary, after the user updated their payment method.

Important

You canâ€™t use this property with newMultiTokenContexts or newAutomaticReloadPaymentRequest properties. Simultaneous use of these properties results in an error and cancels the payment request.
