## Parameters

## Discussion

Apple increments the Apple Pay version number when adding new functionality that is not backward compatible with previous versions of Safari. The same Apple Pay version number applies to both Apple Pay JS and Payment Request APIs.

Check version support to ensure new API can run in the userâ€™s browser, and provide fallback to earlier API versions whenever possible for broadest compatibility. See Apple Pay on the web version history for the version numbers and detailed information.
