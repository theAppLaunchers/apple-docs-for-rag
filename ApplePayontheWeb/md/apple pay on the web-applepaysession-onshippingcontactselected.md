Instance Property

# onshippingcontactselected

An event handler to call when the user selects a shipping contact in the payment sheet.

Safari Desktop 10.0+Safari Mobile 10.0+

``` source
attribute EventHandler onshippingcontactselected;
```

## Discussion

This attribute must be set to a function that accepts an `events` argument; for example,

`session.onshippingcontactselected = function(event) {}`.

The `event` parameter contains the shippingContact attribute. Access this attribute using the `event` parameter, for example,

`var myShippingContact = event.shippingContact;`

The onshippingcontactselected function must respond by calling completeShippingContactSelection before the 30 second timeout, after which a message appears stating that the payment could not be completed.

The shippingContact attribute contains the information you requested by specifying requiredShippingContactFields in ApplePayPaymentRequest.

Before the user authorizes the transaction, you receive redacted shipping contact information in a callback event. The redacted information includes only the necessary data for completing transaction tasks, such as calculating taxes or shipping costs.

Listing 1. An example of redacted shipping contact information

```
{
    "locality": "Cupertino",
    "country": "United States",
    "postalCode": "95014",
    "administrativeArea": "CA",
    "countryCode": "us"
}
```

Note

The data returned may differ based on the userâ€™s geographic region. For Canada and United Kingdom, a redacted shipping address excludes the last three characters of the postal code. For US addresses, the redacted zip code contains the first five digits.

The full postal code is provided after the user authorizes the transaction.
