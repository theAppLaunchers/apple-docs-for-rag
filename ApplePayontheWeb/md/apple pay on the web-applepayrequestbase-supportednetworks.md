To use a network introduced with a specific Apple Pay version, set the ApplePaySession version parameter to the required version number, like this:

```
var session = new ApplePaySession(2, paymentRequest);
```

For the best compatibility with operating systems and browsers, use the lowest possible version number that supports your payment networks and other required features.

In macOS 12.3, iOS 15.4, watchOS 8.5, and Mac Catalyst 15.4 or later, specify payment methods in the order you prefer. For example, to specify the default network to use for cobadged cards, set the first element in the array to the default network, and alternate networks afterward in the order you prefer.

Note

Websites supporting debit networks should check for regional regulations. For more information, see Complying with regional regulations.
