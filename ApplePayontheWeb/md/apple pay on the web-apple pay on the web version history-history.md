## Overview

Specify the Apple Pay version your website supports when you create a session by calling ApplePaySession or by creating an ApplePayRequest. Keep in mind that customers using Apple Pay may be running any version of Apple Pay. The operating system of the customer’s device determines the version of Apple Pay that it runs. To support all customers, make sure your app works properly with all Apple Pay versions. See supportsVersion for more information.
