## Overview

Important

You must include the recurringPaymentRequest property in the ApplePayPaymentRequest object to specify a request for a recurring payment.

Use an ApplePayRecurringPaymentRequest object to provide the user with payment details and a way to manage payment methods for a recurring payment. You can optionally display a billing agreement and set up merchant token life-cycle notifications for the request.

For more information about the merchant token life-cycle notifications, see Apple Pay Merchant Token Management API.
