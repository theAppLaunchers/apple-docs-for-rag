The shipping contact information is populated if it is requested in ApplePayPaymentRequest. See ApplePayPaymentContact for the fields in shippingContact.

Shipping contact information can contain address, name, phone, and email fields. You determine which fields are present by setting the requiredShippingContactFields parameter in ApplePayPaymentRequest. Shipping contact details may differ based on the userâ€™s geographic region.

Before the user authorizes the transaction with Touch ID, Face ID, or passcode, you receive redacted address information when onshippingcontactselected is triggered. Although the address is redacted for privacy, it includes sufficient information for you to compute taxes and shipping costs and refresh the corresponding values and total in the payment sheet.
