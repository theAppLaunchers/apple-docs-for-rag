``` source
func joined(separator: Separator) -> JoinedSequence where Separator : Sequence, Separator.Element == Self.Element.Element
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `Sequence`.

## Parameters 

`separator`  

A sequence to insert between each of this sequence’s elements.

## Return Value

The joined sequence of elements.

## Discussion

This example shows how an array of `[Int]` instances can be joined, using another `[Int]` instance as the separator:

```
let nestedNumbers = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
let joined = nestedNumbers.joined(separator: [-1, -2])
print(Array(joined))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3, -1, -2, 4, 5, 6, -1, -2, 7, 8, 9]"
```

### Generating Subsequences

func drop(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence by skipping elements while `predicate` returns `true` and returning the remaining elements.

func dropFirst(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence containing all but the given number of initial elements.

func prefix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the collection.

func prefix(upTo: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the specified position.

func prefix(through: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection through the specified position.

func prefix(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence containing the initial elements until `predicate` returns `false` and skipping the remaining elements.

func suffix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the collection.

func suffix(from: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the specified position to the end of the collection.

func joined() -> FlattenSequence&lt;Self>

Returns the elements of this sequence of sequences, concatenated.

subscript(Range&lt;Self.Index>) -> Slice&lt;Self>

Accesses a contiguous subrange of the collection’s elements.

Deprecated
