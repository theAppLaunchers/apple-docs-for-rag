``` source
func withContiguousStorageIfAvailable(_ body: (UnsafeBufferPointer) throws -> R) rethrows -> R?
```

## Parameters 

`body`  

A closure to be executed using the elements of this collection.

## Return Value

The value returned by `body`, or `nil`.

## Discussion

The optimizer can often eliminate bounds- and uniqueness-checking within an algorithm. When that fails, however, invoking the same algorithm on `body`â€™s argument may let you trade safety for speed.
