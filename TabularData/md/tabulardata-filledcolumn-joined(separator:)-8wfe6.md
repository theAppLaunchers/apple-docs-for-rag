``` source
func joined(separator: String = "") -> String
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `StringProtocol`.

## Parameters 

`separator`  

A string to insert between each of the elements in this sequence. The default separator is an empty string.

## Return Value

A single, concatenated string.

## Discussion

The following example shows how an array of strings can be joined to a single, comma-separated string:

```
let cast = ["Vivien", "Marlon", "Kim", "Karl"]
let list = cast.joined(separator: ", ")
print(list)
// Prints "Vivien, Marlon, Kim, Karl"
```

### Generating Subsequences

func drop(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence by skipping elements while `predicate` returns `true` and returning the remaining elements.

func dropFirst(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence containing all but the given number of initial elements.

func prefix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the collection.

func prefix(upTo: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the specified position.

Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection through the specified position.

func prefix(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence containing the initial elements until `predicate` returns `false` and skipping the remaining elements.

func suffix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the collection.

func suffix(from: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the specified position to the end of the collection.
