### Generating Subsequences

func drop(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence by skipping elements while `predicate` returns `true` and returning the remaining elements.

func dropFirst(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence containing all but the given number of initial elements.

func prefix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the collection.

func prefix(upTo: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the specified position.

func prefix(through: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection through the specified position.

func prefix(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence containing the initial elements until `predicate` returns `false` and skipping the remaining elements.

func suffix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the collection.

func suffix(from: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence

Returns a subsequence from the specified position to the end of the collection.
