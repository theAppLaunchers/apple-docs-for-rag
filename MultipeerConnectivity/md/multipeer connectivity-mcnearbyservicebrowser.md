### Classes

class MCAdvertiserAssistant

The `MCAdvertiserAssistant` is a convenience class that handles advertising, presents incoming invitations to the user, and handles usersâ€™ responses. Use this class to provide a user interface for handling invitations when your app does not require programmatic control over the invitation process.

class MCBrowserViewController

The `MCBrowserViewController` class presents nearby devices to the user and enables the user to invite nearby devices to a session. To use this class in iOS or tvOS, call methods from the underlying `UIViewController` class (prepare(for:sender:) and performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:) for storyboards or present(_:animated:completion:) and dismiss(animated:completion:) for nib-based views) to present and dismiss the view controller. In macOS, use the comparable `NSViewController` methods presentAsSheet(_:) and dismiss(_:) instead.

class MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser

The `MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser` class publishes an advertisement for a specific service that your app provides through the Multipeer Connectivity framework and notifies its delegate about invitations from nearby peers.

class MCPeerID

An `MCPeerID` object represents a peer in a multipeer session.

class MCSession

An `MCSession` object enables and manages communication among all peers in a Multipeer Connectivity session.
