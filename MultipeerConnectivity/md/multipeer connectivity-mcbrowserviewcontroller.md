# MCBrowserViewController

The `MCBrowserViewController` class presents nearby devices to the user and enables the user to invite nearby devices to a session. To use this class in iOS or tvOS, call methods from the underlying `UIViewController` class (prepare(for:sender:) and performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:) for storyboards or present(_:animated:completion:) and dismiss(animated:completion:) for nib-based views) to present and dismiss the view controller. In macOS, use the comparable `NSViewController` methods presentAsSheet(_:) and dismiss(_:) instead.
