``` source
func send(
    _ data: Data,
    toPeers peerIDs: [MCPeerID],
    with mode: MCSessionSendDataMode
) throws
```

## Parameters 

`data`  

An instance containing the message to send.

`peerIDs`  

An array of peer ID instances representing the peers that should receive the message.

`mode`  

The transmission mode to use (reliable or unreliable delivery).

## Discussion

This method is asynchronous (nonblocking).

On the recipient device, the session instance calls its delegate instanceâ€™s session(_:didReceive:fromPeer:) method with the message after it has been fully received.
