Instance Property

# contentsRect

Returns the rectangle, in unit coordinates, that contains the image within the superview.

macOS 13.0+

``` source
@MainActor
final var contentsRect: CGRect { get }
```

## Discussion

If your app displays the image with NSImageView and you assign it to the trackingImageView property, the framework doesnâ€™t require you to implement this property.

The default value is the entire contents of the superview, which is the unit rectangle `[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]`.
