# visualLookUp

An option that presents a button for more information on any subjects the framework recognizes in the image.

macOS 13.0+

``` source
static let visualLookUp: ImageAnalysisOverlayView.InteractionTypes
```

## Discussion

When the framework identifies something familiar in an image that it can provide more information about (see ImageAnalysisOverlayView.Subject), it offers a button in the bottom-right corner of the view. When people tap the button, a modal sheet appears that offers info about the subject. For example, if the image contains a dog, the modal sheet describes the dogâ€™s breed and provides a relevant web URL where people can read more about the breed.

VisionKit supports Visual Look Up when it recognizes the following subjects:

- Plants and flowers

- Animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, reptiles, and insects

- Places, such as constructed landmarks, sculptures, and natural landmarks

- Art and media, such as paintings, books, and album covers

- Food, such as prepared dishes and desserts

- Symbols, such as laundry care labels and vehicle dashboard indicators
