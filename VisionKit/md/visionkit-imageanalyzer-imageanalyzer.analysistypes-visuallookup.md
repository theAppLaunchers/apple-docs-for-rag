## Discussion

When the framework recognizes a particular type of subject in an image, it offers an interface for people to learn more about the subject. For example, if an image contains a rose, the framework recognizes a plant and enables people to tap the plant which presents a sheet with a list of additional resources on the specific type of plant â€” in this case, a rose.

For more information about subjects in images, see ImageAnalysisInteraction.Subject.
