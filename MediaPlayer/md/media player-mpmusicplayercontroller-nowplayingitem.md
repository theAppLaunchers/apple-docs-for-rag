## Discussion

To specify that playback should begin at a particular media item in the playback queue, set this property to that item while the music player is in a stopped or paused state.

If no media item is playing or designated to play, this propertyâ€™s value is `nil`.

If you use the system music player and the user plays an item from another library using Home Sharing, the value of this property is nil.
