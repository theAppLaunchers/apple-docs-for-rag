## Discussion

When set to true, the designated element has a negative operation performed on the element. The performance of the `negative` command varies depending on the element it is referencing. For example, a `negative` command for a bookmark indicates that the bookmark should be removed. However, a `negative` command for a Like command could just lower the frequency that the designated element is played. This behavior differs from a Dislike command, which would put the designated element on a deny list and never play it again.

Itâ€™s up to the app to determine exactly what should be done when a `negative` command is received.
