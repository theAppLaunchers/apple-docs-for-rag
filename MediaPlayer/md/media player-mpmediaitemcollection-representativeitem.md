## Discussion

The media items in a collection typically share common property values, owing to how you built the collection. For example, if you build a collection based on a predicate that uses the MPMediaItemPropertyArtist property, all items in the collection share the same artist name. You can use the `representativeItem` property to efficiently obtain values for such common propertiesâ€”often more efficiently than fetching an item from the items array.
