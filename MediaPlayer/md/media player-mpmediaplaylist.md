``` source
class MPMediaPlaylist
```

## Overview

Each playlist has a name, a set of attributes, and a unique identifier that persists across application launches.

Users configure playlists using iTunes or by creating a playlist on the device. Playlists are read-only to your iOS app. To obtain playlists, configure a media query thatâ€™s grouped by playlist. Each returned media item collection is a media playlist. The following code snippet illustrates this by logging playlist and song names to the Xcode debugger console:

- Swift
- Objective-C

```
let myPlaylistQuery = MPMediaQuery.playlists()
let playlists = myPlaylistQuery.collections
for playlist in playlists! {
    print(playlist.value(forProperty: MPMediaPlaylistPropertyName)!)

    let songs = playlist.items
    for song in songs {
        let songTitle = song.value(forProperty: MPMediaItemPropertyTitle)
        print("\t\t", songTitle!)
    }
}
```

```
MPMediaQuery *myPlaylistsQuery = [MPMediaQuery playlistsQuery];
NSArray *playlists = [myPlaylistsQuery collections];

for (MPMediaPlaylist *playlist in playlists) {
    NSLog (@"%@", [playlist valueForProperty: MPMediaPlaylistPropertyName]);

    NSArray *songs = [playlist items];
    for (MPMediaItem *song in songs) {
        NSString *songTitle =
            [song valueForProperty: MPMediaItemPropertyTitle];
        NSLog (@"\t\t%@", songTitle);
    }
}
```

MPMediaPropertyPredicate and MPMediaQuery describe the API for building a media query. MPMediaEntity describes the methods for querying media playlist property values.
