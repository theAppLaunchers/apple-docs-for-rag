A set of predicates for defining a filter in a media query.

``` source
class MPMediaPropertyPredicate
```

## Overview

Use one or more `MPMediaPropertyPredicate` objects to define the filter in a media query to retrieve a subset of media items from the Music library. A predicate in this context is a statement of a logical condition that you want to test each media item against. The query retrieves the items that satisfy that condition.

You define Music library queries, and retrieve query results, using the MPMediaQuery class. MPMediaItem and MPMediaItemCollection describe the media items and media item collections that you can retrieve with a query.

## Topics

### Creating media property predicates

init(value: Any?, forProperty: String)

Creates a media property predicate with the default comparison type.

init(value: Any?, forProperty: String, comparisonType: MPMediaPredicateComparison)

Creates a media property predicate with a specified comparison type.

### Examining media property predicates

var property: String

The property that the media property predicate uses when you invoke a query.

var value: Any?

The value that the media property predicate matches against when you invoke a query.

var comparisonType: MPMediaPredicateComparison

The type of matching comparison that the media property predicate performs when you invoke a query.

### Supporting types

enum MPMediaPredicateComparison

Logical comparison types for media queries.
