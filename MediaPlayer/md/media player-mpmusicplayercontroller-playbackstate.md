## Discussion

If you configure a music player as a system music player, the playback state matches the playback state of the built-in Music app. This is true whether the Music app is using the device Music library or a home shared library. Note, however, that when the Music app is using a home shared library, the music playerâ€™s nowPlayingItem property is `nil`.

For the available playback states, see MPMusicPlaybackState.
