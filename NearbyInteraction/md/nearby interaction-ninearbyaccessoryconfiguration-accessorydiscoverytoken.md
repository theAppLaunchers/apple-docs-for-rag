## Discussion

The value of this property refers to a specific peer accessory. To match distance updates your app receives through a session with a peer using session(_:didUpdate:), compare the argument objectâ€™s discovery token with the value of this property.

Subsequent sessions with the same peer device produce a different value for this property. For user privacy, the system assigns a random number unique to the session that prevents the correlation of this property with a particular device.
