## Discussion

If true, the NISession uses extended distance measurement (EDM) capabilities while ranging with a peer thatâ€™s also capable of EDM. This property is compatible with the isCameraAssistanceEnabled property.

To understand the shared capabilities of the devices, check the supportsExtendedDistanceMeasurement property in the deviceCapabilities properties on NISession, and the deviceCapabilities property on the NIDiscoveryToken generated by the peer device.
