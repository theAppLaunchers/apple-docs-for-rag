## Overview

This class represents the central mechanism to interact with nearby objects, for example, a peer Apple device or third-party accessory. After creating an NISession for a nearby object, the app interacts with the object by receiving NISessionDelegate callbacks.

One session represents an interaction between the user and a single nearby object. To interact with multiple nearby objects, create a separate session for each.

For more information, see Initiating and maintaining a session.

protocol NIDeviceCapability

An interface that adds Boolean values that indicate an interaction session feature support.

### Connecting to A Peer Device

var discoveryToken: NIDiscoveryToken?

A temporary, random identifier for a device.

class NIDiscoveryToken

An object that uniquely identifies a peer that participates in an interaction session.

func run(NIConfiguration)

Starts a session with a nearby peer.

var configuration: NIConfiguration?

The configuration run by the session.

var delegateQueue: dispatch_queue_t?

### Managing life cycle

var delegate: (any NISessionDelegate)?

An object that the framework notifies of session events.

func pause()

Stops sending distance and direction updates to the peer.

func invalidate()
