Type Property

# resourceUsageTimeout

An error code that indicates that the framework timed out the session.

iOS 14.0+iPadOS 14.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+watchOS 7.3+

``` source
static var resourceUsageTimeout: NIError.Code { get }
```

## Discussion

The framework times out a session in some cases to preserve resources, such as battery life. An app needs to watch for timed-out peers. If the app wishes to continue interaction with a timed-out peer device, the app needs to begin a new nearby-interaction session.
