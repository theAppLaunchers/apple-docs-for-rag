## Discussion

An app must set a delegate to receive the peerâ€™s distance and direction information through session(_:didUpdate:). The session(_:didInvalidateWith:) and session(_:didRemove:reason:) callbacks notify you when the session invalidated or removed a peer. The system may suspend an interaction session for various reasons (see sessionWasSuspended(_:)), such as when the peer backgrounds the app.
