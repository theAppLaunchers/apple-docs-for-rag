# Algorithm Convergence Status

The possible Objective-C states of Camera Assistance.

## Overview

When the app enables Camera Assistance by setting isCameraAssistanceEnabled = `true`, the framework may require user action before the feature is operational at runtime. This enumeration indicates whether Camera Assistance currently functions as expected on device, and the NIAlgorithmConvergenceStatusReason reasons define the recommended user actions to get Camera Assistance operational, if needed.
