## Topics

### Creating a Try Reduce Publisher

init(upstream: Upstream, initial: Output, nextPartialResult: (Output, Upstream.Output) throws -> Output)

Creates a publisher that applies an error-throwing closure to all received elements and produces an accumulated value when the upstream publisher finishes.

### Declaring Publisher Topography

struct Output

A publisher that publishes elements specified by a range in the sequence of published elements.

typealias Failure

The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting Publisher Properties

let upstream: Upstream

The publisher from which this publisher receives elements.

let initial: Output

The initial value provided on the first-use of the closure.

let nextPartialResult: (Output, Upstream.Output) throws -> Output

An error-throwing closure that takes the previously-accumulated value and the next element from the upstream to produce a new value.
