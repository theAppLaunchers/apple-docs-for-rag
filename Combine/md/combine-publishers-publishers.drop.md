## Topics

### Creating a Drop Publisher

init(upstream: Upstream, count: Int)

Creates a publisher that omits a specified number of elements before republishing later elements.

### Declaring Publisher Topography

typealias Output

The kind of values published by this publisher.

typealias Failure

The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting Publisher Properties

let upstream: Upstream

The publisher from which this publisher receives elements.

let count: Int

The number of elements to drop.

### Comparing Publishers

static func == (Publishers.Drop&lt;Upstream>, Publishers.Drop&lt;Upstream>) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two publishers are equivalent.

static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are not equal.
