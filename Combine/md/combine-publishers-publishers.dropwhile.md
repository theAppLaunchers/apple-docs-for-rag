## Topics

### Creating a Drop While Publisher

init(upstream: Upstream, predicate: (Publishers.DropWhile&lt;Upstream>.Output) -> Bool)

Creates a publisher that omits elements from an upstream publisher until a given closure returns false.

### Declaring Publisher Topography

typealias Output

The kind of values published by this publisher.

typealias Failure

### Inspecting Publisher Properties

let upstream: Upstream

The publisher from which this publisher receives elements.

let predicate: (Publishers.DropWhile&lt;Upstream>.Output) -> Bool

The closure that indicates whether to drop the element.
