## Topics

### Creating a Delay Publisher

init(upstream: Upstream, interval: Context.SchedulerTimeType.Stride, tolerance: Context.SchedulerTimeType.Stride, scheduler: Context, options: Context.SchedulerOptions?)

Creates a publisher that delays delivery of elements and completion to the downstream receiver.

### Declaring Publisher Topography

typealias Output

The kind of values published by this publisher.

typealias Failure

The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting Publisher Properties

let upstream: Upstream

The publisher from which this publisher receives its elements.

let interval: Context.SchedulerTimeType.Stride

The amount of time to delay.

let tolerance: Context.SchedulerTimeType.Stride

The allowed tolerance in firing delayed events.

let scheduler: Context

The scheduler to deliver the delayed events.

let options: Context.SchedulerOptions?

Options relevant to the schedulerâ€™s behavior.

### Controlling Timing

struct MeasureInterval

A publisher that measures and emits the time interval between events received from an upstream publisher.

struct Debounce

A publisher that publishes elements only after a specified time interval elapses between events.

struct Throttle

A publisher that publishes either the most-recent or first element published by the upstream publisher in a specified time interval.

struct Timeout

A publisher that terminates publishing if the upstream publisher exceeds a specified time interval without producing an element.
