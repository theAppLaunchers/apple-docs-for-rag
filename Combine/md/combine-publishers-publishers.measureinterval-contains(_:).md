Instance Method

# contains(\_:)

Publishes a Boolean value upon receiving an element equal to the argument.

``` source
func contains(_ output: Self.Output) -> Publishers.Contains
```

Available when `Output` conforms to `Equatable`.

## Parameters 

`output`  

An element to match against.

## Return Value

A publisher that emits the Boolean value `true` when the upstream publisher emits a matching value.

## Discussion

Use contains(_:) to find the first element in an upstream thatâ€™s equal to the supplied argument. The contains publisher consumes all received elements until the upstream publisher produces a matching element. Upon finding the first match, it emits `true` and finishes normally. If the upstream finishes normally without producing a matching element, this publisher emits `false` and finishes.

In the example below, the contains(_:) operator emits `true` the first time it receives the value `5` from the `numbers.publisher`, and then finishes normally.

```
let numbers = [-1, 5, 10, 5]
numbers.publisher
    .contains(5)
    .sink { print("\($0)") }

// Prints: "true"
```

Publishes a single Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given predicate.

func tryAllSatisfy((Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryAllSatisfy&lt;Self>

Publishes a single Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given error-throwing predicate.
