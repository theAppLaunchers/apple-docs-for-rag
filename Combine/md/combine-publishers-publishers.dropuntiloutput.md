## Topics

### Creating a Drop Until Output Publisher

init(upstream: Upstream, other: Other)

Creates a publisher that ignores elements from the upstream publisher until it receives an element from another publisher.

### Declaring Publisher Topography

typealias Output

The kind of values published by this publisher.

typealias Failure

The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting Publisher Properties

let upstream: Upstream

The publisher from which this publisher receives its elements.

let other: Other

A publisher to monitor for its first emitted element.

### Comparing Publishers

static func == (Publishers.DropUntilOutput&lt;Upstream, Other>, Publishers.DropUntilOutput&lt;Upstream, Other>) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two publishers are equivalent.

static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are not equal.
