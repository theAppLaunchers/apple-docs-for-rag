``` source
func output(at index: Int) -> Publishers.Output
```

## Parameters 

`index`  

The index that indicates the element to publish.

## Return Value

A publisher that publishes a specific indexed element.

## Discussion

Use output(at:) when you need to republish a specific element specified by its position in the stream. If the publisher completes normally or with an error before publishing the specified element, then the publisher doesnâ€™t produce any elements.

In the example below, the array publisher emits the fifth element in the sequence of published elements:

```
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
numbers.publisher
    .output(at: 5)
    .sink { print("\($0)") }

// Prints: "6"
```
