``` source
init(
    upstream: Upstream,
    predicate: @escaping (Publishers.TryRemoveDuplicates.Output, Publishers.TryRemoveDuplicates.Output) throws -> Bool
)
```

## Parameters 

`upstream`  

The publisher from which this publisher receives elements.

`predicate`  

An error-throwing closure to evaluate whether two elements are equivalent, for purposes of filtering. Return `true` from this closure to indicate that the second element is a duplicate of the first. If this closure throws an error, the publisher terminates with the thrown error.
