# tryAllSatisfy(\_:)

Publishes a single Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given error-throwing predicate.

``` source
func tryAllSatisfy(_ predicate: @escaping (Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryAllSatisfy
```

## Parameters 

`predicate`  

A closure that evaluates each received element. Return `true` to continue, or `false` to cancel the upstream and complete. The closure may throw an error, in which case the publisher cancels the upstream publisher and fails with the thrown error.

## Return Value

A publisher that publishes a Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given predicate.

## Discussion

Use the tryAllSatisfy(_:) operator to determine if all elements in a stream satisfy a criteria in an error-throwing predicate you provide. When this publisher receives an element, it runs the predicate against the element. If the predicate returns `false`, the publisher produces a `false` value and finishes. If the upstream publisher finishes normally, this publisher produces a `true` value and finishes. If the predicate throws an error, the publisher fails and passes the error to its downstream subscriber.

In the example below, an error-throwing predicate tests if each of an integer array publisherâ€™s elements fall into the `targetRange`; the predicate throws an error if an element is zero and terminates the stream.

```
let targetRange = (-1...100)
let numbers = [-1, 10, 5, 0]

numbers.publisher
    .tryAllSatisfy { anInt in
        guard anInt != 0 else { throw RangeError() }
        return targetRange.contains(anInt)
    }
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { print ("completion: \($0)") },
        receiveValue: { print ("value: \($0)") }
    )

// Prints: "completion: failure(RangeError())"
```

With operators similar to reduce(_:_:), this publisher produces at most one value.

Note

Upon receiving any request greater than zero, this publisher requests unlimited elements from the upstream publisher.
