struct Published
```

## Overview

Publishing a property with the `@Published` attribute creates a publisher of this type. You access the publisher with the `$` operator, as shown here:

```
class Weather {
    @Published var temperature: Double
    init(temperature: Double) {
        self.temperature = temperature
    }
}

let weather = Weather(temperature: 20)
cancellable = weather.$temperature
    .sink() {
        print ("Temperature now: \($0)")
}
weather.temperature = 25

// Prints:
// Temperature now: 20.0
// Temperature now: 25.0
```

When the property changes, publishing occurs in the property’s `willSet` block, meaning subscribers receive the new value before it’s actually set on the property. In the above example, the second time the sink executes its closure, it receives the parameter value `25`. However, if the closure evaluated `weather.temperature`, the value returned would be `20`.

Important

The `@Published` attribute is class constrained. Use it with properties of classes, not with non-class types like structures.
