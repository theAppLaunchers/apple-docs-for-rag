# allSatisfy(\_:)

Publishes a single Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given predicate.

``` source
func allSatisfy(_ predicate: @escaping (Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.AllSatisfy
```

## Parameters 

`predicate`  

A closure that evaluates each received element. Return `true` to continue, or `false` to cancel the upstream and complete.

## Return Value

A publisher that publishes a Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given predicate.

## Discussion

Use the allSatisfy(_:) operator to determine if all elements in a stream satisfy a criteria you provide. When this publisher receives an element, it runs the predicate against the element. If the predicate returns `false`, the publisher produces a `false` value and finishes. If the upstream publisher finishes normally, this publisher produces a `true` value and finishes.

In the example below, the allSatisfy(_:) operator tests if each an integer array publisherâ€™s elements fall into the `targetRange`:

```
let targetRange = (-1...100)
let numbers = [-1, 0, 10, 5]
numbers.publisher
    .allSatisfy { targetRange.contains($0) }
    .sink { print("\($0)") }

// Prints: "true"
```

With operators similar to reduce(_:_:), this publisher produces at most one value.

Note

Upon receiving any request greater than zero, this publisher requests unlimited elements from the upstream publisher.

Publishes a Boolean value upon receiving an element equal to the argument.

func contains(where: (Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.ContainsWhere&lt;Self>

Publishes a Boolean value upon receiving an element that satisfies the predicate closure.

func tryContains(where: (Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryContainsWhere&lt;Self>

func tryAllSatisfy((Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryAllSatisfy&lt;Self>

Publishes a single Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given error-throwing predicate.
