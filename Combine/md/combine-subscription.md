Receiving and Handling Events with Combine

Processing Published Elements with Subscribers

## Overview

Subscriptions are class constrained because a Subscription has identity, defined by the moment in time a particular subscriber attached to a publisher. Canceling a Subscription must be thread-safe.

You can only cancel a Subscription once.

Canceling a subscription frees up any resources previously allocated by attaching the Subscriber.
