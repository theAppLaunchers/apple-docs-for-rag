## Topics

### Creating a Prefix While Publisher

init(upstream: Upstream, predicate: (Publishers.PrefixWhile&lt;Upstream>.Output) -> Bool)

Creates a publisher that republishes elements while a predicate closure indicates publishing should continue.

### Declaring Publisher Topography

typealias Output

The kind of values published by this publisher.

typealias Failure

The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting Publisher Properties

let upstream: Upstream

The publisher from which this publisher receives elements.

let predicate: (Publishers.PrefixWhile&lt;Upstream>.Output) -> Bool

The closure that determines whether publishing should continue.
