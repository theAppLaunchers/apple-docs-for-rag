``` source
func debounce(
    for dueTime: S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride,
    scheduler: S,
    options: S.SchedulerOptions? = nil
) -> Publishers.Debounce where S : Scheduler
```

## Parameters 

`dueTime`  

The time the publisher should wait before publishing an element.

`scheduler`  

The scheduler on which this publisher delivers elements

`options`  

Scheduler options that customize this publisherâ€™s delivery of elements.

## Return Value

A publisher that publishes events only after a specified time elapses.

## Discussion

Use the debounce(for:scheduler:options:) operator to control the number of values and time between delivery of values from the upstream publisher. This operator is useful to process bursty or high-volume event streams where you need to reduce the number of values delivered to the downstream to a rate you specify.

In this example, a PassthroughSubject publishes elements on a schedule defined by the `bounces` array. The array is composed of tuples representing a value sent by the PassthroughSubject, and a TimeInterval ranging from one-quarter second up to 2 seconds that drives a delivery timer. As the queue builds, elements arriving faster than one-half second `debounceInterval` are discarded, while elements arriving at a rate slower than `debounceInterval` are passed through to the sink(receiveValue:) operator.

```
let bounces:[(Int,TimeInterval)] = [
    (0, 0),
    (1, 0.25),  // 0.25s interval since last index
    (2, 1),     // 0.75s interval since last index
    (3, 1.25),  // 0.25s interval since last index
    (4, 1.5),   // 0.25s interval since last index
    (5, 2)      // 0.5s interval since last index
]

let subject = PassthroughSubject()
cancellable = subject
    .debounce(for: .seconds(0.5), scheduler: RunLoop.main)
    .sink { index in
        print ("Received index \(index)")
    }

for bounce in bounces {
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + bounce.1) {
        subject.send(bounce.0)
    }
}

// Prints:
//  Received index 1
//  Received index 4
//  Received index 5

//  Here is the event flow shown from the perspective of time, showing value delivery through the `debounce()` operator:

//  Time 0: Send index 0.
//  Time 0.25: Send index 1. Index 0 was waiting and is discarded.
//  Time 0.75: Debounce period ends, publish index 1.
//  Time 1: Send index 2.
//  Time 1.25: Send index 3. Index 2 was waiting and is discarded.
//  Time 1.5: Send index 4. Index 3 was waiting and is discarded.
//  Time 2: Debounce period ends, publish index 4. Also, send index 5.
//  Time 2.5: Debounce period ends, publish index 5.

### Controlling Timing

func measureInterval&lt;S>(using: S, options: S.SchedulerOptions?) -> Publishers.MeasureInterval&lt;Self, S>

Measures and emits the time interval between events received from an upstream publisher.

func delay&lt;S>(for: S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride, tolerance: S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride?, scheduler: S, options: S.SchedulerOptions?) -> Publishers.Delay&lt;Self, S>

Delays delivery of all output to the downstream receiver by a specified amount of time on a particular scheduler.

func throttle&lt;S>(for: S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride, scheduler: S, latest: Bool) -> Publishers.Throttle&lt;Self, S>

Publishes either the most-recent or first element published by the upstream publisher in the specified time interval.

func timeout&lt;S>(S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride, scheduler: S, options: S.SchedulerOptions?, customError: (() -> Self.Failure)?) -> Publishers.Timeout&lt;Self, S>

Terminates publishing if the upstream publisher exceeds the specified time interval without producing an element.
