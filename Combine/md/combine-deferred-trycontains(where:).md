# tryContains(where:)

Publishes a Boolean value upon receiving an element that satisfies the throwing predicate closure.

``` source
func tryContains(where predicate: @escaping (Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryContainsWhere
```

## Parameters 

`predicate`  

A closure that takes an element as its parameter and returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the element satisfies the closureâ€™s comparison logic.

## Return Value

A publisher that emits the Boolean value `true` when the upstream publisher emits a matching value.

## Discussion

Use tryContains(where:) to find the first element in an upstream that satisfies the error-throwing closure you provide.

This operator consumes elements produced from the upstream publisher until the upstream publisher either:

- Produces a matching element, after which it emits `true` and the publisher finishes normally.

- Emits `false` if no matching element is found and the publisher finishes normally.

If the predicate throws an error, the publisher fails, passing the error to its downstream.

In the example below, the tryContains(where:) operator tests values to find an element less than `10`; when the closure finds an odd number, like `3`, the publisher terminates with an `IllegalValueError`.

```
struct IllegalValueError: Error {}

let numbers = [3, 2, 10, 5, 0, 9]
numbers.publisher
    .tryContains {
        if ($0 % 2 != 0) {
            throw IllegalValueError()
        }
       return $0
