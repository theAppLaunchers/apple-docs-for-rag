``` source
typealias xpc_listener_incoming_session_handler_t = (xpc_session_t) -> Void
```

## Discussion

When a client connects to your service, the system invokes this block with a session that represents the serverâ€™s connection to the client. Before returning from this block, you must do one of the following:

- Call xpc_session_set_incoming_message_handler to set a handler for incoming messages.

- Call xpc_session_cancel to cancel the session.

Important

Failure to take one of these actions results in an API misuse crash.

When the `incoming_session_handler` returns, the system automatically activates the peer session unless you explicitly cancel it.
