## Discussion

Unlike a connection, an endpoint is an inert object that doesnâ€™t have any associated runtime activity. So, it is safe to pass an endpoint in a message. Upon receiving an endpoint, the recipient can use xpc_connection_create_from_endpoint(_:) to create as many distinct connections as necessary.
