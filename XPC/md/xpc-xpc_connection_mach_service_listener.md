## Discussion

Pass this to xpc_connection_create_mach_service(_:_:_:). This flag indicates that the caller is the listener for the named service. Only pass this flag for services in the processâ€™s `launchd.plist`. You may not use this flag to dynamically add services to the Mach bootstrap namespace.
