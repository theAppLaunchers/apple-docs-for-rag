``` source
func withUnsafeUnderlyingDictionary(_ closure: (xpc_object_t) throws -> ReturnType) rethrows -> ReturnType
```

## Parameters 

`closure`  

A closure that takes an xpc_object_t parameter. If `closure` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the withUnsafeUnderlyingDictionary(body:) function.

## Return Value

The return value, if any, of the closure.

## Discussion

Warning

Itâ€™s possible for `closure` to perform operations on the dictionary that cause the receiving dictionary to no longer wrap the underlying dictionary.
