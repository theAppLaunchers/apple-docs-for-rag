## Discussion

An app may pass this value to xpc_activity_set_state(_:_:) to indicate that the system needs to defer the activity (place it back into the XPC_ACTIVITY_STATE_WAIT state) until satisfying its criteria again. Deferring an activity doesnâ€™t reset any of its time-based criteria; it remains past due. Do this in response to observing xpc_activity_should_defer(_:).
