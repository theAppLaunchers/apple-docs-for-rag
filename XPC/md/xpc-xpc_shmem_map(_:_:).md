``` source
func xpc_shmem_map(
    _ xshmem: xpc_object_t,
    _ region: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> Int
```

## Parameters 

`xshmem`  

The shared memory object to be examined.

`region`  

On return, this will point to the region at which the shared memory was mapped.

## Return Value

The length of the region that was mapped. If the mapping failed, 0 is returned.

## Discussion

The resulting region must be disposed of with `munmap(2)`.

It is the responsibility of the caller to manage protections on the new region accordingly.
