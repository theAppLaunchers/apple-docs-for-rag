Function

# xpc_set_event_stream_handler(\_:\_:\_:)

Sets the event handler to invoke when receiving streamed events.

macOS 10.7+

``` source
func xpc_set_event_stream_handler(
    _ stream: UnsafePointer,
    _ targetq: dispatch_queue_t?,
    _ handler: @escaping xpc_handler_t
)
```

## Parameters 

`stream`  

The name of the event stream for which this handler will be invoked.

`targetq`  

The GCD queue to which the event handler block will be submitted. This parameter may be NULL, in which case the connectionâ€™s target queue will be the default target queue of `libdispatch`, defined as `DISPATCH_TARGET_QUEUE_DEFAULT`.

`handler`  

The event handler block. The event which this block receives as its first parameter will always be a dictionary which contains the XPC_EVENT_KEY_NAME key. The value for this key will be a string whose value is the name assigned to the XPC event specified in the `launchd.plist`. Future keys may be added to this dictionary.

## Discussion

Multiple calls to this function for the same event stream will result in undefined behavior.
