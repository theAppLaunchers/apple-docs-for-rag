# Interpreting responses

Learn about responses from Apple Media Feed API to your Apple Music Feed requests.

## Overview

Learn how Apple Media Feed API responds to requests for Apple Music Feed data and how to interpret responses.

Apple Media Feed API has two kinds of responses: resource collections and errors.

## Understand a response

Resource collection responses contain a `data` array and a `resources` object.

Error responses contain an array of one or more error objects that indicate any issues while handling the request. The status code of the response reflects the primary error.

Default responses for common requests include the following:

| Request description | Status code | Response description |
|----|----|----|
| The request is for an existing single resource object. | `200 (OK)` | The `data` array contains the requested resource object. |
| The request is for a single resource object that doesn’t exist. | `404 (NotFound)` | The response doesn’t contain a `data` array. |
| The request is for multiple resource objects by ID. | `200 (OK)` | The `data` array includes the existing resource objects. |
| The request is for multiple resource objects by ID and none of the resources exist. | `200 (OK)` | The `data` array is empty. |
| The request isn’t accepted because its authorization is missing or invalid due to an issue with the developer token. | `401 (Unauthorized)` | The response doesn’t contain a `data` array. |
| The request isn’t accepted because the request is using incorrect authentication. | `403 (Forbidden)` | The response doesn’t contain a `data` array. |
| The request isn’t supported as specified. | `400 (Bad Request)` | The `errors` array contains an error object for any identified problem. |
| The request encounters errors on the server. | Any status code in the 500 range | The `errors` array contains error objects for the errors for any identified problems. |
