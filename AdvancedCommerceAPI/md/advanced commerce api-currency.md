Specifying prices for Advanced Commerce SKUs

## Discussion

The currency property contains an ISO 4217 alpha-3 string that represents the currency of the price of a SKU. You provide a currency value each time you create or modify a purchase transaction.

To get the current storefrontâ€™s currency in your app:

- In iOS 15 through iOS 17, check the `Product.priceFormatStyle.currencyCode` of the generic product ID that represents your Advanced Commerce product. For more information, see priceFormatStyle.

- In iOS 17 and later, get the currency value using `Storefront.current.currency`.

For a list of regions and currencies that the App Store supports, see Financial reports regions and currencies.
