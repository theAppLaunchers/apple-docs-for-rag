# Choosing tax codes for your SKUs

Select a tax code for each SKU that represents a product your app offers as an in-app purchase.

## Overview

Each SKU, which represents a unique product that your app offers as an in-app purchase, needs a tax code. You provide the tax code value each time you use the Advanced Commerce API to transact.

Use the following table to look up tax codes for your products.

Note

Other tax codes are available, similar to those listed in Set a tax category. If you donâ€™t see an appropriate tax code for your product in the table below, send a request using the Advanced Commerce API Access form on the Advanced Commerce API page.
