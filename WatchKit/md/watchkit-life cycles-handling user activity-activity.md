# Handling User Activity

Detect and respond to user activity information from Handoff or a complication.

## Overview

SwiftUI provides the onContinueUserActivity(_:perform:) modifier to handle incoming NSUserActivity objects. This replaces the WatchKit extension delegateâ€™s handle(_:) method.

For example, if you create a complication descriptor using the init(identifier:displayName:supportedFamilies:userActivity:) initializer to pass in an NSUserActivity object, when the user taps the corresponding complication, the system activates your app and passes the activity object to your onContinueUserActivity(_:perform:) modifiers. You can use the activity object to navigate to the corresponding content in your app.

```
// Create a list of the user's favorite cities.
List(favoriteCities) { city in

    // Create a navigation link for each city.
    // Activate the link if it is for the selected city.
    NavigationLink(city.name,
                   destination: CityDetailView(city: city),
                   isActive: checkActive(city: city))

        .onContinueUserActivity(viewCityFromComplication) { activity in

            // App received a user activity object.
            // Check to see whether it has a city index in the userInfo dictionary.
            if let id = activity.userInfo?[cityIDKey] as? String {

                // Navigate to the specified city.
                selectedCity = allCities[id]
            }
            else {

                // Display the favorite city list.
                selectedCity = nil
            }
        }
}
```

Note that in this example, `selectedCity` is a state variable that holds a `City` instance. The `checkActive(city:)` method creates a binding that indicates whether the given city is the currently selected city.

```
@State var selectedCity: City? = nil

// Returns a binding that determines whether a given
// city is the currently selected city.
func checkActive(city: City) -> Binding {
    Binding {
        selectedCity == city
    }
    set: {
        // If the binding is set to true, set the selected city
        // to the provided city.
        if $0 {
            selectedCity = city
        }
        // if the binding is set to false,
        // and the selected city is set to the provided city,
        // clear the selected city.
        else if selectedCity == city {
            selectedCity = nil
        }
    }
}
```
