Instance Property

# applicationState

The runtime state of the watchOS app.

watchOS 7.0+

``` source
@MainActor
var applicationState: WKApplicationState { get }
```

## Discussion

The watchOS app may be active, inactive, or running in the background. Use this property to get the current state. To receive notifications about state changes, implement the appropriate methods of the WKApplicationDelegate object, or create a SwiftUI view that updates based on changes to the ScenePhase environment value.
