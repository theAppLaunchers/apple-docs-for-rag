Instance Property

# allowableMovement

The maximum movement of the finger on the interface object that allows the gesture to be recognized.

watchOS 3.0+

``` source
var allowableMovement: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

The allowable movement is measured in points. The default value of this property is `10`, but you can change this value when configuring the gesture recognizer in Interface Builder.
