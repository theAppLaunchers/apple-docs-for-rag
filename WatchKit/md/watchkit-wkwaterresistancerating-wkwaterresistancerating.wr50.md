## Discussion

This rating indicates a water resistance of 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010. Apple Watch may be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or an ocean. It is also safe to wear Apple Watch while showering or in a hot tub. However, the watch should not be used for scuba diving, waterskiing, or other activities involving high-velocity water or submersion below shallow depth.
