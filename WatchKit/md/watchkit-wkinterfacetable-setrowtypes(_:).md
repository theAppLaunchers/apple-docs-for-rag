Instance Method

# setRowTypes(\_:)

Creates the row controllers to use when populating the table with data.

watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func setRowTypes(_ rowTypes: [String])
```

## Parameters 

`rowTypes`  

An array of strings, each of which corresponds to the name of a row controller defined in your storyboard file. The total number of items in this array is the number of rows to be created in the table.

## Discussion

Use this method when you want to display more than one type of row in your table. This method removes any existing rows from the table and configures a new set of rows based on the information in the `rowTypes` parameter. For each row, the method also creates an instance of that rowâ€™s class and puts the resulting object in an internal array, which you access using the rowController(at:) method. It is your responsibility to configure each new row controller with the data you want to display.

The order of the strings in the `rowTypes` parameter determines the order of the row controller objects you retrieve using the rowController(at:) method, with the first row type used to create the row controller at index 0, the second row type used to create the row controller at index 1, and so on.
