Handling Common State Transitions

## Discussion

The system calls this method when the app transitions from the background to the foreground. Override this method to undo many of the changes you made to your app upon entering the background. The call to this method is invariably followed by a call to the applicationDidBecomeActive() method, as the app moves from the inactive to the active state.

Note

When creating an app that uses the SwiftUI App protocol to manage your life cycle, use the onChange(of:perform:) modifier and the scenePhase environment value to monitor life cycle changes when possible. For more information, see Building a watchOS app.
