Instance Method

# setTaskCompleted()

Marks the task as complete.

watchOS 3.0â€“4.0Deprecated

``` source
func setTaskCompleted()
```

Deprecated

Use setTaskCompletedWithSnapshot(_:) instead.

## Discussion

Call this method as soon as you have finished the background task. The system provides your extension with a limited amount of time to finish the task (on the order of seconds). If you do not call setTaskCompleted() on the task, the system continues to run in the background until all the available time is consumed, wasting battery power.

The system suspends the extension as soon as all background tasks are complete.
