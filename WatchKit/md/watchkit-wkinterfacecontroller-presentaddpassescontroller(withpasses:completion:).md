## Discussion

Use this method to display PassKit passes to the user and to give the user the option to add them to their pass library. This method executes asynchronously, returning shortly after you call it. During a subsequent run loop cycle, the system displays the pass interface over the current interface controller. Always call this method from your WatchKit extensionâ€™s main thread.

The user dismisses the interface using the built-in controls. At dismissal time, the interface controller executes your `completion` block so that you can perform any relevant cleanup tasks.
