### Constants

let WKMediaPlayerControllerOptionsAutoplayKey: String

The option to play a media file automatically when it is displayed. The value of this key is an NSNumber object containing a Boolean value indicating whether the media file should begin playing automatically when the interface is displayed. Playback is also contingent upon the file being available and ready to play on Apple Watch. If you do not specify this option, the user must initiate playback.

The number of seconds into the media file at which to begin playback. The value of this key is an NSNumber object containing an TimeInterval value. Playback begins at the specified number of seconds past the original start point of the media file. If you do not specify this option, playback begins at the beginning of the media file.

let WKMediaPlayerControllerOptionsLoopsKey: String
