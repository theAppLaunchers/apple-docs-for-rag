Case

# WKExtendedRuntimeSessionState.invalid

Either the session has encountered an error, or it has stopped running.

watchOS 6.0+

``` source
case invalid
```

## Discussion

The system passes a WKExtendedRuntimeSessionInvalidationReason value to the session delegateâ€™s extendedRuntimeSession(_:didInvalidateWith:error:) method. Use this value to determine why the session became invalid.
