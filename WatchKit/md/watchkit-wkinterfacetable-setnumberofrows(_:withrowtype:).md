Instance Method

# setNumberOfRows(\_:withRowType:)

Creates the specified number of row controllers (of the same type) to use in populating the table with data.

watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func setNumberOfRows(
    _ numberOfRows: Int,
    withRowType rowType: String
)
```

## Parameters 

`numberOfRows`  

The total number of rows to display in the table.

`rowType`  

The name of a row controller defined in your storyboard file. This string corresponds to the value in the Identifier attribute of a row controller definition in your storyboard file.

## Discussion

Use this method when you want to populate a table with rows that are all of the same type. This method removes any existing rows from the table and configures a new set of rows based on the information in the `numberOfRows` and `rowType` parameters. For each row, the method also creates an instance of that rowâ€™s class and puts the resulting object in an internal array, which you access using the rowController(at:) method. It is your responsibility to configure each new row controller with the data you want to display.
