Instance Property

# curvesAtBottom

A Boolean value that determines whether the rows shrink to match the curved corners at the bottom of the screen.

watchOS 5.1+

``` source
var curvesAtBottom: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Defaults to false. If true, table rows near the bottom of the screen shrink so that the curved corners donâ€™t clip them. This property has no effect on Apple Watch Series 3 or earlier.
