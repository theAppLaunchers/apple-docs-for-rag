## Discussion

The `Interstitials` property defines points within a TVMediaItem object where you can insert another media item; for example, a short ad. Each time range in the array contains two properties: startTime and duration. The `startTime` is the length of time from the beginning of a media item, in seconds. The `duration` is the length of the interstitial, in seconds. Both properties are required. A common use for these objects is to define when and where ads are to be played during a stream.
