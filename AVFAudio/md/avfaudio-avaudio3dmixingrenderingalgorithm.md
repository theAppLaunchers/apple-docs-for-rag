``` source
enum AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithm
```

## Overview

The rendering algorithms differ in quality and CPU cost. AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithm.equalPowerPanning is the simplest panning algorithm and the least expensive computationally.

When rendering to multichannel hardware, most of the rendering algorithms only render to channels 1 and 2, excluding AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithm.soundField and AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithm.auto.

## Topics

### Rendering Algorithms

case auto

Automatically selects the highest-quality rendering algorithm available for the current playback hardware.

case equalPowerPanning

An algorithm that pans the data of the mixer bus into a stereo field.

case HRTF

A high-quality algorithm that uses filtering to emulate 3D space in headphones.

case HRTFHQ

A higher-quality head-related transfer function rendering algorithm.

case soundField

An algorithm that renders to multichannel hardware.

case sphericalHead

An algorithm that emulates 3D space in headphones by simulating interaural time delays and other spatial cues.

case stereoPassThrough

An algorithm to use when the source data doesnâ€™t need localization.
