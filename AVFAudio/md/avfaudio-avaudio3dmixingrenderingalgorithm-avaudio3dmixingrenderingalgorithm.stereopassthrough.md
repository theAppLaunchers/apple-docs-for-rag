# AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithm.stereoPassThrough

An algorithm to use when the source data doesnâ€™t need localization.

iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.10+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
case stereoPassThrough
```

## Discussion

This takes mono and stereo input and passes it to channels 1 and 2 without localization. If the input and output `AudioChannelLayout` differ, mixing happens according to the kAudioFormatProperty_MatrixMixMap property of the layouts.
