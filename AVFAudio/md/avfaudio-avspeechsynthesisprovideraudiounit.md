## Overview

Use a speech synthesizer audio unit to generate audio buffers that contain speech for a given voice and speech markup. The audio unit receives an AVSpeechSynthesisProviderRequest as input, and extracts audio buffers through the render block.

Use speechSynthesisOutputMetadataBlock to provide metadata as an array of AVSpeechSynthesisMarker.

The system scans and loads voices for audio unit extensions of this type, and the voices it provides are available for use in AVSpeechSynthesizer and accessibility technologies like VoiceOver and Speak Screen.

Important

Network access isnâ€™t allowed in speech synthesizers.

## Topics
