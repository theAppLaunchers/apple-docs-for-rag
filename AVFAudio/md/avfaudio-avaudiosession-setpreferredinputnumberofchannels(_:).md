## Discussion

This method requests a change to the number of input channels. To determine whether the change has taken effect, query or key-value observe the inputNumberOfChannels property.

Requesting input channels less than one or greater than that returned by the maximumInputNumberOfChannels results in an error.

Set the preferred number of input channels only after setting the audio sessionâ€™s category and mode, and activating the session.
