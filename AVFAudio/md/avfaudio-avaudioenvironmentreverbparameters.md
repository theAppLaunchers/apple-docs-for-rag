# AVAudioEnvironmentReverbParameters

A class that encapsulates the parameters that you use to control the reverb of the environment node class.

``` source
class AVAudioEnvironmentReverbParameters
```

## Overview

Use reverberation to simulate the acoustic characteristics of an environment. The AVAudioEnvironmentNode class has a built-in reverb that describe the space that the listener is in.

The reverb has a single filter that sits at the end of the chain. You use this filter to shape the overall sound of the reverb. For instance, select one of the reverb presets to simulate the general space, and then use the filter to brighten or darken the overall sound.

You canâ€™t create a standalone instance of AVAudioEnvironmentReverbParameters. Only an instance vended by a source object is valid, such as an AVAudioEnvironmentNode instance.

## Topics

### Enabling and Disabling Reverb

var enable: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether reverberation is in an enabled state.

### Getting and Setting Reverb Values

var level: Float

Controls the amount of reverb, in decibels.

var filterParameters: AVAudioUnitEQFilterParameters

A filter that the system applies to the output.

func loadFactoryReverbPreset(AVAudioUnitReverbPreset)

Loads one of the reverbs factory presets.
