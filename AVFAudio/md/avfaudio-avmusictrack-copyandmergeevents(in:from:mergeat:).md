Instance Method

Copies the events from the source track and merges them into the current music track.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
func copyAndMergeEvents(
    in range: AVBeatRange,
    from sourceTrack: AVMusicTrack,
    mergeAt mergeStartBeat: AVMusicTimeStamp
)
```

## Parameters 

`range`  

The range of beats.

`sourceTrack`  

The music track to copy the events from.

`mergeStartBeat`  

The start beat where the copied events merge into.

## Discussion

The system wonâ€™t modify events originally at or past the start beat. Copying events from track to track follows the same type-exclusion rules as adding events.
