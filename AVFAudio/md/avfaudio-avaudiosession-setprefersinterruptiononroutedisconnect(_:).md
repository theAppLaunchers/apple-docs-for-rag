func setPrefersInterruptionOnRouteDisconnect(_ inValue: Bool) throws
```

## Parameters 

`inValue`  

Specify a false value to opt out of interruption on route disconnect. Set to true to reset to the default behavior.

## Discussion

The expected behavior of an app is to pause playback if a route change occurs due to a device no longer being available (AVAudioSession.RouteChangeReason.oldDeviceUnavailable). Starting in iOS 17, the system interrupts active Now Playing sessions when a route change occurs due to a disconnection event, but doesnâ€™t interrupt other sessions.
