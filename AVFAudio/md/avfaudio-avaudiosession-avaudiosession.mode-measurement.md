Type Property

# measurement

A mode that indicates that your app is performing measurement of audio input or output.

iOS 5.0+iPadOS 5.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
static let measurement: AVAudioSession.Mode
```

## Discussion

Use this mode for apps that need to minimize the amount of system-supplied signal processing to input and output signals. If recording on devices with more than one built-in microphone, the session uses the primary microphone.

For use with the playback, record, or playAndRecord audio session categories.

Important

This mode disables some dynamics processing on input and output signals, resulting in a lower-output playback level.
