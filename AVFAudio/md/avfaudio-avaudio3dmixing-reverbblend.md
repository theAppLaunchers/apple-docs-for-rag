## Discussion

This property controls the amount of the sourceâ€™s audio that the AVAudioEnvironmentNode instance processes. A value of `0.5` results in an equal blend of dry and processed (wet) audio.

The default is `0.0`, and the range of valid values is `0.0` (completely dry) to `1.0` (completely wet). Only the AVAudioEnvironmentNode class implements this property.
