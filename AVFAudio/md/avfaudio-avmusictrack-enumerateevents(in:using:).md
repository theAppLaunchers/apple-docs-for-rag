Instance Method

# enumerateEvents(in:using:)

Iterates through the music events within the track.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
func enumerateEvents(
    in range: AVBeatRange,
    using block: (AVMusicEvent, UnsafeMutablePointer, UnsafeMutablePointer) -> Void
)
```

## Parameters 

`range`  

The range to iterate through.

`block`  

The block to call for each event.

## Discussion

Examine each event the block returns by using isKind(of:) to determine the subclass, and then cast and access it accordingly.

The iteration may continue after removing an event.

The event object returned through the block wonâ€™t be the same instances you add to the AVMusicTrack, though the content is identical.
