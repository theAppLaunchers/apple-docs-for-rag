``` source
class AVAudioEnvironmentDistanceAttenuationParameters
```

## Overview

Important

A source object (for example, AVAudioEnvironmentNode) provides an instance to this object. You canâ€™t create standalone instances.

## Topics

### Getting and Setting the Attenuation Model

var distanceAttenuationModel: AVAudioEnvironmentDistanceAttenuationModel

The distance attenuation model that describes the drop-off in gain as the source moves away from the listener.

enum AVAudioEnvironmentDistanceAttenuationModel

Types of distance attenuation models.

### Getting and Setting the Attenuation Values

var maximumDistance: Float

The distance beyond which the node applies no further attenuation, in meters.

var referenceDistance: Float

The minimum distance at which the node applies attenuation, in meters.

var rolloffFactor: Float

A factor that determines the attenuation curve.
