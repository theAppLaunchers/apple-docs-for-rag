## Discussion

This mode is valid only with the record and playAndRecord audio session categories. On devices with more than one built-in microphone, the audio session uses the microphone closest to the video camera.

Use this mode to ensure that the system provides appropriate audio-signal processing.

Use AVCaptureSession in conjunction with the video recording mode for greater control of input and output routes. For example, setting the automaticallyConfiguresApplicationAudioSession property results in the session automatically choosing the best input route for the device and camera used.
