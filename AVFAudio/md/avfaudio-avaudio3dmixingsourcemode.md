``` source
enum AVAudio3DMixingSourceMode
```

## Overview

The source mode determines how the individual channels of an input bus distribute in space.

## Topics

### Source Modes

case spatializeIfMono

A mono input bus that renders as a point source at the location of the source node.

case bypass

A mode that does no spatial rendering.

case pointSource

All channels of the bus render as a single source at the location of the source node.

case ambienceBed

The input channels spread around the listener as far-field sources that anchor to global space.
