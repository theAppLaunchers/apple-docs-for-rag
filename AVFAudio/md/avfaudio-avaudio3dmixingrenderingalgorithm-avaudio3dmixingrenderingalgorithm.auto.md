## Discussion

This selects the highest-quality rendering algorithm available for the current playback hardware.

The algorithm may not be identical to other existing algorithms. It may change in the future as new algorithms emerge.

When in manual rendering mode or wired output, you may need to set the outputType on AVAudioEnvironmentNode. Multichannel rendering requires setting a channel layout on an AVAudioEnvironmentNode output.
