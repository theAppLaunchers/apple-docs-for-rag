## Discussion

This category can be used for input, output, or both. For example, use this category to route audio to both a USB device and a set of headphones. Use of this category requires a more detailed knowledge of, and interaction with, the capabilities of the available audio routes.

Important

Route changes can invalidate part or all of your multi-route configuration. When using the multiRoute category, it is essential that you register to observe routeChangeNotification notifications and update your configuration as necessary.
