var secondaryAudioShouldBeSilencedHint: Bool { get }

## Discussion

Use this property as a hint to silence audio thatâ€™s secondary to the functionality of the app. For example, in a game that uses the ambient category, you can use this property to mute the soundtrack while leaving sound effects unmuted.
