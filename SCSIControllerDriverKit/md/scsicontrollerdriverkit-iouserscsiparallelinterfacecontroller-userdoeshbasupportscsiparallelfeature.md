Instance Method

# UserDoesHBASupportSCSIParallelFeature

Determines whether the driver extension class supports a specific feature in response to a call from the framework.

DriverKit

``` source
kern_return_t UserDoesHBASupportSCSIParallelFeature(uint32_t theValue, bool * result);
```

## Parameters 

`theValue`  

The SCSI parallel interconnect (SPI) feature to check.

`result`  

A pointer to a Boolean value. On return, set this value to `true` if it supports the feature, and `false` if it doesnâ€™t.

## Return Value

A value that indicates the result of determining if the driver extension class supports the feature. kIOReturnSuccess indicates success. For error definitions, see IOKit Constants.

## Discussion

The SCSI parallel interconnect standard defines the features that `theValue` specifies.
