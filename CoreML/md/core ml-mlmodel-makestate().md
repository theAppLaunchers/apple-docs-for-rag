## Discussion

Core ML framework will allocate the state buffers declared in the model.

The allocated state buffers are initialized to zeros. To initialize with different values, use `.withMultiArray(for:)` to get the mutable `MLMultiArray`-view to the state buffer.

```
// Create state that contains two state buffers: s1 and s2.
// Then, initialize s1 to 1.0 and s2 to 2.0.
let state = model.makeState()
state.withMultiArray(for: "s1") { stateMultiArray in
    stateMultiArray[0] = 1.0
}
state.withMultiArray(for: "s2") { stateMultiArray in
    stateMultiArray[0] = 2.0
}
```
