``` source
init(
    unsafeUninitializedShape shape: [Int],
    scalarType: any MLTensorScalar.Type,
    initializingWith initializer: (UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer) throws -> Void
) rethrows
```

## Parameters 

`shape`  

The dimensions of the tensor.

`scalarType`  

The scalar type.

`initializer`  

A closure which will be called to initialize the underlying memory of the tensor. Scalars expected to be stored contiguously in first-major order.
