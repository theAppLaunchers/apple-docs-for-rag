``` source
func unstacked(alongAxis axis: Int = 0) -> [MLTensor]
```

## Parameters 

`axis`  

The dimension along which to unstack. The `axis` must be in the range `[-rank, rank)`.

## Return Value

An array containing the unstacked tensors.

## Discussion

Unpacks `N` tensors from this tensor by chipping it along the `axis` dimension, where `N` is inferred from this tensorâ€™s shape. For example, given a tensor with shape `[A, B, C, D]`:

- If `axis == 0` then the `i`-th tensor in the returned array is the slice `self[i, nil, nil, nil]` and each tensor in that array will have shape `[B, C, D]`.

- If `axis == 1` then the `i`-th tensor in the returned array is the slice `value[:, i, :, :]` and each tensor in that array will have shape `[A, C, D]`.

- Etc.

This is the opposite of `MLTensor.init(stacking:alongAxis:)`.
