# Model Integration Samples

Integrate tabular, image, and text classifcation models into your app.

## Overview

Use the provided Core ML sample code projects to learn how to classify numeric values, images, and text within applications. For example, you can detect poses of the human body, classify a group of images, and locate answers to questions in a text document.

## Topics

### Tabular Data Models

Integrating a Core ML Model into Your App

Add a simple model to an app, pass input data to the model, and process the model’s predictions.

### Image Classification Models

Using Core ML for semantic image segmentation

Identify multiple objects in an image by using the DEtection TRansformer image-segmentation model.

Classifying Images with Vision and Core ML

Crop and scale photos using the Vision framework and classify them with a Core ML model.

Detecting human body poses in an image

Locate people and the stance of their bodies by analyzing an image with a PoseNet model.

Understanding a Dice Roll with Vision and Object Detection

Detect dice position and values shown in a camera frame, and determine the end of a roll by leveraging a dice detection model.

### Text Classification Models

Finding answers to questions in a text document

Locate relevant passages in a document by asking the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model a question.
