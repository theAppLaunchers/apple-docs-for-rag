``` source
class UNCalendarNotificationTrigger
```

## Overview

Create a UNCalendarNotificationTrigger object when you want to schedule the delivery of a local notification at the date and time you specify. You use an NSDateComponents object to specify only the time values that you want the system to use to determine the matching date and time.

Listing 1 creates a trigger that delivers its notification every morning at 8:30. The repeating behavior is achieved by specifying `true` for the `repeats` parameter when creating the trigger.
