## Discussion

When this property is false, the system delivers the notification only once. When this property is true, the system reschedules the notification request automatically, resulting in the system delivering the notification each time the trigger condition is met. To unschedule the notification request, use the methods of the UNUserNotificationCenter to remove the notification request.
