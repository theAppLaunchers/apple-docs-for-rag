Instance Property

# image

An image used to represent the message in the transcript.

iOS 10.0+iPadOS 10.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+

``` source
var image: UIImage? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The system crops the left and right edges of the image by 6 points, and rounds the imageâ€™s corners.

The template can have either an image or a media file. If this property is set to a non-`nil` value, the mediaFileURL property is ignored. This property defaults to `nil`.
