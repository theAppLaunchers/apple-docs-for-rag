) throws
```

## Parameters 

`fileURL`  

A URL for the image displayed by this sticker. This URL must refer to a file saved on the device. The file must be a PNG, APNG, GIF, or JPEG, and must be less than 500 KB. For the best results, the image should not be smaller than 100 x 100 points or larger than 206 x 206 points. Always provide @3x images (300 x 300 pixels to 618 x 618 pixels). The system generates the @2x and @1x versions by downscaling the @3x images at runtime.

`localizedDescription`  

A succinct, localized description of the sticker. The description is limited to 150 Unicode characters. The system uses this string as an accessibility description of the sticker.

## Return Value

A newly initialized sticker object, or `nil` if an error occurs.
