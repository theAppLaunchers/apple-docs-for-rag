## Overview

Agents are game entities that move according to realistic constraints and whose behavior is determined by goals that motivate movement. The general functionality of an agent is defined by the abstract superclass GKAgent; however, you use instances of the GKAgent2D class to implement agent-based gameplay in a 2D game (or in a 3D game where gameplay-relevant movement is restricted to two dimensions).

To learn more about using goals and agents, see Agents, Goals, and Behaviors in GameplayKit Programming Guide.

## Topics

### Managing an Agentâ€™s Position and Orientation

var position: vector_float2

The current position of the agent in 2D space.

var rotation: Float

The rotation of the agent around the z-axis.

### Running the Agent Simulation

func update(deltaTime: TimeInterval)

Causes the agent to evaluate its goals and update its position, rotation, and velocity accordingly.

var velocity: vector_float2

The current velocity of the agent in 2D space.
