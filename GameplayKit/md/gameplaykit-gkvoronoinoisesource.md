# GKVoronoiNoiseSource

A procedural noise generator whose output (also called Worley noise or cellular noise) divides space into discrete cells surrounding random seed points.

## Overview

Voronoi noise can generate textures resembling natural phenomena such as crystalline structures, cracked mud, or star fields.

Like all GKNoiseSource subclasses, a Voronoi noise source represents a noise generation algorithm and its parameters. To make use of a noise source, first create GKNoise object from it (and optionally apply operations to that noise object or combine it with other noise objects). Then create a GKNoiseMap object from your noise object, generating a concrete field of values that you can sample from directly or visualize using the SKTexture or `SKTileMap` class.

## Topics

### Creating a Noise Source

init(frequency: Double, displacement: Double, distanceEnabled: Bool, seed: Int32)

Initializes a Voronoi noise source with the specified parameters.

class func voronoiNoise(withFrequency: Double, displacement: Double, distanceEnabled: Bool, seed: Int32) -> Self

Creates a Voronoi noise source with the specified parameters.

### Managing Noise Generation Parameters

var frequency: Double

A value that determines the number and size of cells in generated noise.

var displacement: Double

The range of random values to assign to each cell in generated noise.

var isDistanceEnabled: Bool

A Boolean value that specifies whether generated noise values incorporate the distance from each point to the nearest seed point.

var seed: Int32

The value that determines the specific configuration of noise produced by the noise source.
