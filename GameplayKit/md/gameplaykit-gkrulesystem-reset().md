## Discussion

Calling this method restarts the evaluation process: the system removes all rules from the current agenda and executed lists and empties the facts set. (However, the ruleâ€™s state dictionary is left unchanged.) The system then automatically repopulates its agenda according to the salience of each rule in the rules array.
