## Discussion

You specify origin, width, and height when creating a grid graph with the init(fromGridStartingAt:width:height:diagonalsAllowed:) initializer. After initialization, you can use this property to examine the parameters the graph was created with—for example, to draw the grid as a debugging overlay in your game UI.
