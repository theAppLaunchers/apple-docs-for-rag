## Discussion

A Voronoi noise source generates a field of noise values by randomly picking seed points at random positions in a space, then dividing the space into cells so that all the points in a cell are closer to that cellâ€™s seed point than to any other seed point.

Increasing frequency increases the number of seed points in any given unit area of a generated noise map, thus also decreasing the size of the cells that surround them. The default value is `1.0`.
