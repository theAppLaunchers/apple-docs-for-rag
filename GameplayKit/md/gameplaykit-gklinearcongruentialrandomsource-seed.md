var seed: UInt64 { get set }
```

## Discussion

Any two random sources initialized with the same seed value will generate the same sequence of random numbers. To replicate the behavior of an existing GKLinearCongruentialRandomSource instance, read this property and then create a new instance by passing the resulting value to the init(seed:) initializer.

For a source of high-entropy seed data, see the SecRandomCopyBytes(_:_:_:) function.
