## Discussion

A GKRuleSystem object evaluates the rules in its agenda list in order of decreasing salience.

Typically, you set the salience of a rule before calling the add(_:) or add(_:) method, so that the system can insert the new rule into its agenda at the proper position. Changing the salience of a rule already in a rule system does not affect its order in the current agenda, but it does affect the order of the new agenda the rule system builds when you call its reset() method.
