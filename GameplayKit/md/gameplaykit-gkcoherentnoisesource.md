## Overview

In general, *noise* is randomness across a (one-, two-, three-, or many-dimensional) domain—for example, you can create noise by filling an image with values from a random number generator. Unlike such truly random noise, *coherent noise* is consistent and smooth: you can always generate the same output from a specific seed value, and small variations across the domain create only small variations in noise values.

You don’t instantiate or work directly with this class. Instead, the concrete subclasses of GKCoherentNoiseSource each provide a different style of coherent noise.

## Topics

### Managing Noise Generation Parameters

var frequency: Double

A value that determines the size and spacing of features in generated noise.

var octaveCount: Int

The number of octaves of the underlying noise function to use for generating noise.

var lacunarity: Double

The rate at which successive octaves of the noise function increase in frequency.

var seed: Int32

The value that determines the specific configuration of noise produced by the noise source.
