## Overview

The GKState abstract class defines the features of state classes to be used with a state machine (a GKStateMachine object). You build a state machine by defining a separate GKState subclass for each state of the machine. In each state class, you use the isValidNextState(_:) method to define which other states are valid for a machine to transition into. State classes provide a place to put state-dependent game logic, such as actions that should happen when entering or exiting a specific state, or per-frame update code that is valid only when in a specific state.

For more information about state machines, read State Machines in GameplayKit Programming Guide.

## Topics

### Creating a State

init()

Initializes a state object.

### Working with State Machines

var stateMachine: GKStateMachine?

The state machine that owns this state object.

func isValidNextState(AnyClass) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether a state machine currently in this state is allowed to transition into the specified state.

### Handling State Transitions and Updates

func didEnter(from: GKState?)

Performs custom actions when a state machine transitions into this state.

func update(deltaTime: TimeInterval)

Performs custom actions when a state machine updates while in this state.

func willExit(to: GKState)

Performs custom actions when a state machine transitions out of this state.
