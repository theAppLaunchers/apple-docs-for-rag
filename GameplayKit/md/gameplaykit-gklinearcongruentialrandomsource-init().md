Initializer

# init()

Initializes a random source from a nondeterministic seed.

``` source
convenience init()
```

## Return Value

A new, independent random source.

## Discussion

Calling this method seeds the random source with a sequence of bytes sampled from a high-entropy system source. To later replicate the sequence of numbers generated by this source, read the seed property and use the resulting value to initialize another random source with the init(seed:) initializer.

For more information, see GameplayKit Programming Guide.
