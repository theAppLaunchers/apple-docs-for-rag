``` source
func evaluatePredicate(in system: GKRuleSystem) -> Bool
```

## Return Value

true if the rule is satisfied (and its action should be executed); otherwise, false.

## Discussion

A rule system calls this method when evaluating its rules.

If the rule was created with the init(predicate:assertingFact:grade:) or init(predicate:retractingFact:grade:), calling this method returns the result of testing the predicate against the provided rule system. If the rule was created with the init(blockPredicate:action:) method, calling this method calls the predicate block and returns the result. Otherwise, this method always returns falseâ€”subclasses should override this method to implement their own predicate tests.
