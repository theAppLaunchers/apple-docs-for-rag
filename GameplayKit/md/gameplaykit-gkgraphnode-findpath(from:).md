Instance Method

# findPath(from:)

Computes and returns a sequence of nodes that represents the lowest-cost graph traversal from the specified node to this node.

``` source
func findPath(from startNode: GKGraphNode) -> [GKGraphNode]
```

## Parameters 

`startNode`  

The origin node from which to attempt traversal of the graph.

## Return Value

An array of nodes representing a path through the graph in start to end order, or an empty array if no path exists between the specified nodes.

## Discussion

This method is equivalent to the findPath(to:) method, but finds a path from the specified node to this node, rather than the other way around. Connections in a graph are directionalâ€”that is, a connection from Node A to Node B indicates only that travel is possible from A to B, and indicating that travel from B to A is also possible requires a separate connection. Therefore, calling the findPath(to:) and findPath(from:) methods with the same pair of nodes might not always return the same paths.
