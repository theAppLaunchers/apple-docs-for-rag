``` source
class GKGridGraphNode
```

## Overview

Together, a network of nodes form a graph that describes the navigability of a game world. Use graph nodes with a GKGridGraph object (and methods of its superclass GKGraph) to perform actions that relate to the network of nodes as a whole, such as pathfinding to determine routes through the network.

To learn more about graphs and pathfinding, see Pathfinding in GameplayKit Programming Guide.

## Topics

### Creating a Graph Node

init(gridPosition: vector_int2)

Initializes a graph node with the specified position on a grid.

### Inspecting a Nodeâ€™s Position

var gridPosition: vector_int2

The position of the node on a discrete integer grid.
