Instance Method

# rotate(by:)

Rotates the entire noise field by the specified x, y, and z angles.

iOS 10.0+iPadOS 10.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.12+tvOS 10.0+visionOS 1.0+

``` source
func rotate(by radians: vector_double3)
```

## Parameters 

`radians`  

A vector whose x, y, and z components each provide a rotation angle in radians around the corresponding axis in the noise field.

## Discussion

A noise field is inherently three-dimensional and infinite in extent; when you create a GKNoiseMap object from a noise object, the resulting array of noise values is a “slice” of the noise field (through its `z = 0` plane, with a specified size and position). By translating, rotating, and scaling the noise field in 3D before you create a noise map, you can create interesting effects. For example, applying an x- or y-axis rotation to noise generated by a GKCylindersNoiseSource object “slices” along the length of the cylinders, creating a wood-grain pattern.
