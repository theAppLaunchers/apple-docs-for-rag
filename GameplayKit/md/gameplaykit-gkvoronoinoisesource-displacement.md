## Discussion

A Voronoi noise source generates a field of noise values by randomly picking seed points at random positions in a space, then dividing the space into cells so that all the points in a cell are closer to that cellâ€™s seed point than to any other seed point.

After dividing space into cells, the noise source randomly assigns a unique value to each; the range of values is from negative to positive the value of this property. For example, if the displacement value is `1.0` (the default), cell values range from `-1.0` to `1.0`.
