## Discussion

You call this method directly on an individual agent, or on all the agents in your game through a GKComponentSystem object, whenever you want to run a step of the agent simulation. Typically, a game updates its agent simulation whenever it prepares to draw a new frameâ€”for example, in the update(_:) method of a SpriteKit SKScene object.
