## Discussion

This array should contain instances of your player class (a custom class implementing the GKGameModelPlayer protocol) representing the players in the game. When you use the GKMinmaxStrategist class to find an optimal move for a specific player, GameplayKit uses this array to rate the moves of that playerâ€™s opponent(s).

For more information, see GameplayKit Programming Guide.
