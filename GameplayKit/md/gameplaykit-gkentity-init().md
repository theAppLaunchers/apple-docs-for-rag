## Return Value

## Discussion

If you create a GKEntity subclass and define any additional initializers, you must delegate to this initializer. You do not need to subclass GKEntity to use Entity-Component architectureâ€”generally, you should create a custom entity class only when you need a place to store state or resources that are shared by multiple components.
