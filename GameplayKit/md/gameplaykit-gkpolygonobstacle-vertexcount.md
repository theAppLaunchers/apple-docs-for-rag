## Discussion

Obstacles are immutable objects; to change the shape of an obstacle, remove it and create a new obstacle with a new list of vertices. Use this property along with the vertex(at:) method to inspect an existing obstacleâ€”for example, to draw a debugging overlay representing the obstacle in your game.
