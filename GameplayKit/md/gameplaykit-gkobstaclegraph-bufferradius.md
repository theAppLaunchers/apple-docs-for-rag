## Discussion

You set this property when creating a graph with the init(obstacles:bufferRadius:) initializer. Use the `bufferRadius` initializer parameter to take the size of potential travelers into account when determining navigability. After initialization, you can use this property to examine the buffer radius the graph was created withâ€”for example, to draw a debugging overlay in your game UI that indicates passable and impassable areas.

### Working with Nodes

func connectUsingObstacles(node: NodeType)

Adds the specified node to the graph, connecting it to its nearest neighbors without creating connections that pass through obstacles or their buffer regions.

func connectUsingObstacles(node: NodeType, ignoring: [GKPolygonObstacle])

Adds the specified node to the graph, connecting it to its nearest neighbors while ignoring the area occupied by the specified obstacles.

func connectUsingObstacles(node: NodeType, ignoringBufferRadiusOf: [GKPolygonObstacle])

Adds the specified node to the graph, connecting it to its nearest neighbors while ignoring the buffer regions around the specified obstacles.
