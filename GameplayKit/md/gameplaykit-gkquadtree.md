## Overview

A quadtree manages its structure to optimize for spatial searchesâ€”unlike a basic data structure such as an array or dictionary, a quadtree can find all elements occupying a specific position or region very quickly. The quadtree partitioning strategy divides space into four quadrants at each level, as illustrated in Figure 1. When a quadrant contains more than one object, the tree subdivides that region into four smaller quadrants, adding a level to the tree.

Quadtrees can be useful for many tasks in game design. For example:

- Deciding which game characters are close enough to each other for interaction

- Deciding which portions of a large game world need to be processed at a given time

The GKQuadtree class is one of three spatial partitioning data structures that GameplayKit provides. See these other classes for other tasks:

- The GKOctree class provides the three-dimensional equivalent of a quadtree. Use an octree when you need to organize objects in 3D space.

- The GKRTree class provides a different algorithm for two-dimensional spatial indexing. Quadtrees and R-trees have different performance tradeoffs for different tasks: quadtrees can be faster when objects are more uniformly distributed in space or when their positions change frequently, and R-trees can be faster when searching for all objects in a given region.

## Topics

### Creating a Quadtree

init(boundingQuad: GKQuad, minimumCellSize: Float)

Initializes a quadtree with the specified dimensions.

### Adding and Removing Elements

func add(ElementType, at: vector_float2) -> GKQuadtreeNode

Adds an object to the tree corresponding to the specified point in 2D space.

func add(ElementType, in: GKQuad) -> GKQuadtreeNode

Adds an object to the tree corresponding to the specified region of 2D space.

func remove(ElementType, using: GKQuadtreeNode) -> Bool

Removes the specified object from the tree, using a reference to its containing node.

func remove(ElementType) -> Bool

Searches for the specified object and removes it from the tree.

### Searching for Elements

func elements(at: vector_float2) -> [ElementType]

Returns all objects whose corresponding locations overlap the specified point.

func elements(in: GKQuad) -> [ElementType]

Returns all objects whose corresponding locations overlap the specified region.

### Constants

For more information, see .

struct GKQuad

The definition of an axis-aligned rectangle addressed by the tree.
