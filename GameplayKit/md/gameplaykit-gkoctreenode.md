``` source
class GKOctreeNode
```

## Overview

You donâ€™t create instances of this class directly; instead, a GKOctree object provides you with a GKOctreeNode instance when you add an element to a tree. If you plan to remove elements from the tree, keep references to the corresponding nodes so you can use the remove(_:using:) method for better performance.
