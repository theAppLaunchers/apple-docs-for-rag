## Discussion

Random samplings from the distribution are most likely to result in the mean value, with other values increasingly far from the mean occurring with decreasing probability.

This property is read-onlyâ€”its value is always the midpoint between the values of the inherited lowestValue and highestValue properties (`mean = (highest + lowest) / 2`).
