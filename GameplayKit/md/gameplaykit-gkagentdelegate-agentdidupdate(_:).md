optional func agentDidUpdate(_ agent: GKAgent)
```

## Parameters 

`agent`  

The agent object that has just performed a simulation step.

## Discussion

Implement this method when you want to update a display based on the latest data from the agent simulation. Read the position and rotation properties of the agent (as a GKAgent2D or GKAgent3D object), then set the corresponding attributes of the object that provides the agentâ€™s visual representation.
