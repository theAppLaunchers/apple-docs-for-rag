## Overview

Billow noise is similar to Perlin noise (see the GKPerlinNoiseSource class), but with more rounded features resembling natural phenomena such as treetops and hills.

Like all GKNoiseSource subclasses, a billow noise source represents a noise generation algorithm and its parameters. To make use of a noise source, first create GKNoise object from it (and optionally apply operations to that noise object or combine it with other noise objects). Then create a GKNoiseMap object from your noise object, generating a concrete field of values that you can sample from directly or visualize using the SKTexture or `SKTileMap` class.

## Topics

### Creating a Noise Source

init(frequency: Double, octaveCount: Int, persistence: Double, lacunarity: Double, seed: Int32)

Creates a billow noise source with the specified parameters.

var persistence: Double

The rate at which successive octaves of the noise function decrease in amplitude.
