``` source
func addObstacles(_ obstacles: [GKPolygonObstacle])
```

## Parameters 

`obstacles`  

An array of obstacle objects to be added to the graph.

## Discussion

Adding a new obstacle to the graph has the same effect as if that obstacle were present when creating the graphâ€”that is, the GKObstacleGraph class automatically creates new nodes and edges where necessary to describe the navigable area around the complete collection of obstacles.
