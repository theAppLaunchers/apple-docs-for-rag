## Discussion

You set this property when creating a graph with the init(bufferRadius:minCoordinate:maxCoordinate:) or init(bufferRadius:minCoordinate:maxCoordinate:nodeClass:) initializer. Use the `bufferRadius` initializer parameter to take the size of potential travelers into account when determining navigability. After initialization, you can use this property to examine the buffer radius the graph was created withâ€”for example, to draw a debugging overlay in your game UI that indicates passable and impassable areas.
