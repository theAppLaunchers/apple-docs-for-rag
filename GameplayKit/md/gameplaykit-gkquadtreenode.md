``` source
class GKQuadtreeNode
```

## Overview

You donâ€™t create instances of this class directly; instead, a GKQuadtree object provides you with a GKQuadtreeNode instance when you add an element to a tree. If you plan to remove elements from the tree, keep references to the corresponding nodes so you can use the remove(_:using:) method for better performance.

For more information, see GameplayKit Programming Guide.
