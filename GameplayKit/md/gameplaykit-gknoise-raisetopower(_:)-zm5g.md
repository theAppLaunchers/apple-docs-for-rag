Instance Method

# raiseToPower(\_:)

Replaces values in the noise field by exponentiating them with values from the specified noise object.

``` source
func raiseToPower(_ noise: GKNoise)
```

## Parameters 

`noise`  

The noise object from which to use values as exponents.

## Discussion

Noise values are generally in the range \[-1.0, 1.0\], so exponentiating some points in a noise field can result in values outside the floating-point domain. Depending on the stylistic result youâ€™re looking for, choose your base and exponent noises carefully or use other noise operations (such as the clamp(lowerBound:upperBound:) and remapValues(toCurveWithControlPoints:) methods) to conform the exponent noise to a specific range before using this method.
