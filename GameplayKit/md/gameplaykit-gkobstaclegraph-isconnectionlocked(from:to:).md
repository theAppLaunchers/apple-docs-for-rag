Instance Method

# isConnectionLocked(from:to:)

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the specified nodes are protected from disconnection due to the addition of obstacles.

``` source
func isConnectionLocked(
    from startNode: NodeType,
    to endNode: NodeType
) -> Bool
```

## Parameters 

`startNode`  

A node in the graph.

`endNode`  

Another node in the graph to which the node `startNode` is directly connected.

## Return Value

true if the connection between the specified nodes has been locked with the lockConnection(from:to:) method; otherwise, false.

## Discussion

By default, adding obstacles with the addObstacles(_:) method disconnects pairs of nodes if the direct path between them intersects an obstacle. This behavior ensures that using the findPathBetweenNodes:toNode: method does not result in a path through the graph that crosses obstacles. With certain nodes, this behavior might not be desirableâ€”use the lockConnection(from:to:) method to protect a connection between nodes from being automatically destroyed and the unlockConnection(from:to:) method to remove such protection.
