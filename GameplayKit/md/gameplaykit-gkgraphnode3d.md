## Overview

Together, a network of nodes form a graph that describes the navigability of a game world. Use graph nodes with a GKGraph object to perform actions that relate to the network of nodes as a whole, such as pathfinding to determine routes through the network.

To learn more about graphs and pathfinding, see Pathfinding in GameplayKit Programming Guide.

## Topics

### Creating a Graph Node

init(point: vector_float3)

Initializes a graph node with the specified point.

class func node(withPoint: vector_float3) -> Self

Creates a graph node with the specified point.

### Inspecting a Nodeâ€™s Position

var position: vector_float3

The position of the node in continuous 2D space.
