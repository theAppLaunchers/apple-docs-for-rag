## Overview

Together, a network of nodes form a graph that describes the navigability of a game world. Use graph nodes with a GKGraph, GKObstacleGraph, or GKMeshGraph object to perform actions that relate to the network of nodes as a whole, such as pathfinding to determine routes through the network.

When you use the GKObstacleGraph or GKMeshGraph class to describe a game world in terms of open spaces interrupted by obstacles, GameplayKit automatically creates and manages GKGraphNode2D instances that represent positions along possible paths that navigate around those obstacles.

To learn more about graphs and pathfinding, see Pathfinding in GameplayKit Programming Guide.

## Topics

### Creating a Graph Node

init(point: vector_float2)

Initializes a graph node with the specified point.

class func node(withPoint: vector_float2) -> Self

Creates a graph node with the specified point.

### Inspecting a Nodeâ€™s Position

var position: vector_float2

The position of the node in continuous 2D space.
