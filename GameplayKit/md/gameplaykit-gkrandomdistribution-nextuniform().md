Instance Method

# nextUniform()

Generates and returns a new random floating-point value within the characteristics of the distribution.

```

## Return Value

A random floating-point value within the range `[delta, 1.0]`, where `delta` is the ratio of the lowestValue and highestValue properties.

## Discussion

When using the GKRandomDistribution class directly, generated numbers are uniform within the range of the distribution. For example, in a distribution whose lowest value is `1` and highest is `20` (as produced by the d20() class method), `delta` is `1/20 = 0.05`; that is, the distribution returns numbers in 5% increments. Subclasses of GKRandomDistribution can alter this quantization, as well as relative probability of generating any particular number within the distributionâ€™s range.
