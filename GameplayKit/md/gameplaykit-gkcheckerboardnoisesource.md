## Overview

Checkerboard noise can be useful as an input to GKNoise methods that create noise by combining other noise objects through various operations.

Like all GKNoiseSource subclasses, a checkerboard noise source represents a noise generation algorithm and its parameters. To make use of a noise source, first create GKNoise object from it (and optionally apply operations to that noise object or combine it with other noise objects). Then create a GKNoiseMap object from your noise object, generating a concrete field of values that you can sample from directly or visualize using the SKTexture or `SKTileMap` class.

## Topics

### Creating a Noise Source

init(squareSize: Double)

Initializes a checkerboard noise source with the specified square size.

class func checkerboardNoise(withSquareSize: Double) -> Self

Creates a checkerboard noise source with the specified square size.

### Managing Noise Generation Parameters

var squareSize: Double

The size (both width and height) of squares in the generated checkerboard pattern.
