``` source
func concatenating(_ t2: AffineTransform3D) -> AffineTransform3D
```

## Parameters 

`t2`  

The affine transform that the function concatenates to this affine transform.

## Return Value

The affine transformation matrix that results from concatenating two existing affine transforms.

## Discussion

This function performs the matrix multiplication `self * t2` on the underlying matrices of the two transforms.
