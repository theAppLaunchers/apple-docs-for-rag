## Discussion

A `DescType` data type is a four-character code that stores a value that identifies the data in an AEDesc descriptor, the basic building block for all Apple events.

The descriptor type constants used by the Apple Event Manager are described in Descriptor Type Constants and Key Form and Descriptor Type Object Specifier Constants.
