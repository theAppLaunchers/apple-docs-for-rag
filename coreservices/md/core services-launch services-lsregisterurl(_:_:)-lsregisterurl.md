A Boolean value specifying whether Launch Services should update existing information registered for the app, if any. If this parameter is `false`, the app will not be registered if it has already been registered previously and its current modification date has not changed from when it was last registered; if the parameter is `true`, the appâ€™s registered information will be updated even if its modification date has not changed.
