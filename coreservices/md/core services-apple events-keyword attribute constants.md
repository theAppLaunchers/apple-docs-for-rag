# Keyword Attribute Constants

Specify keyword values for Apple event attributes.

## Overview

These constants are keyword constants for Apple event attributes. An Apple event consists of attributes (which identify the Apple event and denote its task) and, often, parameters (which contain information to be used by the target application). An Apple event attribute is a descriptor that identifies the event class, event ID, target application, or some other characteristic of the Apple event. Taken together, the attributes of an Apple event denote the task to be performed on any data specified in the Apple eventâ€™s parameters.

Keywords are arbitrary names used by the Apple Event Manager to keep track of various descriptors. Your application cannot examine the contents of an Apple event directly. Instead, you call Apple Event Manager routines such as those described in Getting Data or Descriptors From Apple Events and Apple Event Records to request attributes and parameters by keyword.

See also Keyword Parameter Constants.

### Version-Notes

The constant `keyReplyRequestedAttr` was added in OS X version 10.3.
