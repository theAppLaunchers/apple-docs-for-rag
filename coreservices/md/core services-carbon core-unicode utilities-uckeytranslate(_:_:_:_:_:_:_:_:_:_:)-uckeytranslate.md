Function

# UCKeyTranslate(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Converts a combination of a virtual key code, a modifier key state, and a dead-key state into a string of one or more Unicode characters.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
func UCKeyTranslate(
    _ keyLayoutPtr: UnsafePointer!,
    _ virtualKeyCode: UInt16,
    _ keyAction: UInt16,
    _ modifierKeyState: UInt32,
    _ keyboardType: UInt32,
    _ keyTranslateOptions: OptionBits,
    _ deadKeyState: UnsafeMutablePointer!,
    _ maxStringLength: Int,
    _ actualStringLength: UnsafeMutablePointer!,
    _ unicodeString: UnsafeMutablePointer!
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`keyLayoutPtr`  

A pointer to the first element in a resource of type `'uchr'`. Pass a pointer to the `'uchr'` resource that you wish the `UCKeyTranslate` function to use when converting the virtual key code to a Unicode character. The resource handle associated with this pointer need not be locked, since the `UCKeyTranslate` function does not move memory.

`virtualKeyCode`  

An unsigned 16-bit integer. Pass a value specifying the virtual key code that is to be translated. For ADB keyboards, virtual key codes are in the range from 0 to 127.

`keyAction`  

An unsigned 16-bit integer. Pass a value specifying the current key action. See Key Actions for descriptions of possible values.

`modifierKeyState`  

An unsigned 32-bit integer. Pass a bit mask indicating the current state of various modifier keys. You can obtain this value from the modifiers field of the event record as follows:

modifierKeyState = ((EventRecord.modifiers) >> 8) &amp; 0xFF;

`keyboardType`  

An unsigned 32-bit integer. Pass a value specifying the physical keyboard type (that is, the keyboard shape shown by Key Caps). You can call the function `LMGetKbdType` for this value.

`keyTranslateOptions`  

A bit mask of options for controlling the `UCKeyTranslate` function. See Key Translation Options Flag and Key Translation Options Mask for descriptions of possible values.

`deadKeyState`  

A pointer to an unsigned 32-bit value, initialized to zero. The `UCKeyTranslate` function uses this value to store private information about the current dead key state.

`maxStringLength`  

A value of type `UniCharCount`. Pass the number of 16-bit Unicode characters that are contained in the buffer passed in the `unicodeString` parameter. This may be a value of up to 255, although it would be rare to get more than 4 characters.

`actualStringLength`  

A pointer to a value of type `UniCharCount`. On return this value contains the actual number of Unicode characters placed into the buffer passed in the `unicodeString` parameter.

`unicodeString`  

An array of values of type `UniChar`. Pass a pointer to the buffer whose sized is specified in the `maxStringLength` parameter. On return, the buffer contains a string of Unicode characters resulting from the virtual key code being handled. The number of characters in this string is less than or equal to the value specified in the `maxStringLength` parameter.

## Return Value

A result code. If you pass `NULL` in the `keyLayoutPtr` parameter, `UCKeyTranslate` returns `paramErr`. The `UCKeyTranslate` function also returns `paramErr` for an invalid `'uchr`' resource format or for invalid `virtualKeyCode` or `keyAction` values, as well as for `NULL` pointers to output values. The result `kUCOutputBufferTooSmall` (-25340) is returned for an output string length greater than `maxStringLength`.

## Discussion

Use of the `UCKeyTranslate` function is discouraged in applications. Use the `NSEvent` method characters(byApplyingModifiers:) in its place to process mouse and keyboard-related events.

The `UCKeyTranslate` function uses the data in a Unicode keyboard-layout (`'uchr'`) resource to map a combination of virtual key code and modifier key state to a sequence of up to 255 Unicode characters. This mapping process depends on, and may update, a dead key state; the `UCKeyTranslate` function and the `'uchr'` resource support multiple dead keys. The mapping may also depend on the specific type of key action and the type of physical keyboard being used. The `UCKeyTranslate` function supports non-ADB keyboards, an extensible set of modifier keys, and other possible extensions.

In most cases, your application does not need to call the `UCKeyTranslate` function, since the Text Services Manager automatically calls it on your behalf to handle input from a Unicode keyboard layout. However, there may be some circumstances in which your application should call `UCKeyTranslate`. For example, your application may need to determine what character(s) would have been generated for the virtual key code in the current key-down event if a different modifier-and-key combination had been used.

The basic process by which `UCKeyTranslate` uses the `'uchr'` resource to translate virtual key codes into Unicode characters is detailed in the following steps:

1.  The bit pattern specifying the modifier key state is mapped by the `UCKeyModifiersToTableNum` structure to a table number.

2.  The table number maps to an offset within a `UCKeyToCharTableIndex` structure that refers to the actual key-code-to-character tables.

3.  The key-code-to-character tables map the virtual key code to `UCKeyOutput` values, for which there are two possibilities:

    - If bits 15 and 14 of the `UCKeyOutput` value are 01, the `UCKeyOutput` value is an index into the offsets contained in a `UCKeyStateRecordsIndex` structure. If this occurs, the mapping process for the virtual key code continues on to the next step

    - Otherwise, the `UCKeyOutput` value produces one or more Unicode characters, either directly or via reference to a `UCKeySequenceDataIndex` structure. This ends the mapping process for a given virtual key code.

4.  The offsets in a `UCKeyStateRecordsIndex` structure refer to `UCKeyStateRecord` dead-key state records.

5.  The dead-key state records map from the current dead-key state to one or more Unicode characters to be output or the following dead-key state (if any). The mapping process for a given virtual key code may end with the dead-key state record or, if there is no dead-key state record entry for the key code, with a default state terminator, as specified in the resource’s `UCKeyStateTerminators` table.
