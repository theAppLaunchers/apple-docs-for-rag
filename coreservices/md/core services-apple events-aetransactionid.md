## Discussion

A transaction is a sequence of Apple events that are sent back and forth between the client and server applications, beginning with the clientâ€™s initial request for a service. When you call the AECreateAppleEvent(_:_:_:_:_:_:) function, you pass a value of type `AETransactionID` for the `transactionID` parameter. ID Constants for the AECreateAppleEvent Function lists the valid constant values for a variable or parameter of this type.
