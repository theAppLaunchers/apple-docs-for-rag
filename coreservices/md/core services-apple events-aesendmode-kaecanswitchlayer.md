## Discussion

The application switch preferenceâ€”if both the client and server allow interaction, and if the client application is the active application on the local computer and is waiting for a reply (that is, it has set the `kAEWaitReply` flag), `AEInteractWithUser` brings the server directly to the foreground. Otherwise, `AEInteractWithUser` uses the Notification Manager to request that the user bring the server application to the foreground.

You should specify the `kAECanSwitchLayer` flag only when the client and server applications reside on the same computer. In general, you should not set this flag if it would be confusing or inconvenient to the user for the server application to come to the front unexpectedly. This flag is ignored if you are sending an Apple event to a remote computer.
