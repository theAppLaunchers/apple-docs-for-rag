## Discussion

You can translate between a descriptor of this type and an instance of `CFURL` by calling CFURLCreateWithBytes(_:_:_:_:_:) and specifying `kCFStringEncodingUTF8` for the encoding. Or, if you have a CFURL, you can call CFURLCreateData(_:_:_:_:) to get the data as an instance of `CFData` (again specifying an encoding of `kCFStringEncodingUTF8`), andCFDataGetBytes(_:_:_:) to get the actual bytes to insert into a descriptor of this type.
