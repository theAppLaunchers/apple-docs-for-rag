Structure

# UCKeyboardLayout

Provides header data for a `'uchr'` resource.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+

``` source
struct UCKeyboardLayout
```

## Overview

The Unicode keyboard-layout ( `'uchr'`) resource contains the data necessary to map virtual key codes to Unicode character codes for a given keyboard layout. The `'uchr'` format consists of a header information section and five key mapping data sections. The `UCKeyboardLayout` type is used in the `'uchr'` resource header. It specifies version and format information, offsets to the various subtables, and an array of `UCKeyboardTypeHeader` entries.

You should use low-ASCII (0 - 0x7F) only for the KCHR/uchr resource names and you should use Unicode in the Info.plist file when you specify strings for the user-interface (UI).

## Topics

### Initializers

init()

init(keyLayoutHeaderFormat: UInt16, keyLayoutDataVersion: UInt16, keyLayoutFeatureInfoOffset: UInt32, keyboardTypeCount: UInt32, keyboardTypeList: UCKeyboardTypeHeader)

### Instance Properties

var keyLayoutDataVersion: UInt16

An unsigned 16-bit integer identifying the version of the data in the resource, in binary code decimal format. For example, 0x0100 would equal version 1.0.

var keyLayoutFeatureInfoOffset: UInt32

An unsigned 32-bit integer providing an offset to a structure of type UCKeyLayoutFeatureInfo, if such is used in the resource. May be 0 if no `UCKeyLayoutFeatureInfo` table is included in the resource.

var keyLayoutHeaderFormat: UInt16

An unsigned 16-bit integer identifying the format of the structure. Set to `kUCLayoutHeaderFormat`.

var keyboardTypeCount: UInt32

An unsigned 32-bit integer specifying the number of `UCKeyboardTypeHeader` structures in the `keyboardTypeList[]` fieldâ€™s array.

var keyboardTypeList: UCKeyboardTypeHeader

A variable-length array containing structures of type `UCKeyboardTypeHeader`. Each `UCKeyboardTypeHeader` entry specifies a range of physical keyboard types and contains offsets to each of the key mapping sections to be used for that range of keyboard types.
