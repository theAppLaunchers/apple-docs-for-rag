## Discussion

Identifies an optional parameter to the `opendocuments` Apple event, described in Event ID Constants. The parameter contains the search text from the Spotlight search that identified the documents to be opened. The application should make a reasonable effort to display an occurrence of the search text in each opened documentâ€”for example by scrolling the text into view.
