Function

# AEFlattenDesc(\_:\_:\_:\_:)

Flattens the specified descriptor and stores the data in the supplied buffer.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
func AEFlattenDesc(
    _ theAEDesc: UnsafePointer!,
    _ buffer: Ptr!,
    _ bufferSize: Size,
    _ actualSize: UnsafeMutablePointer!
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`theAEDesc`  

A pointer to the descriptor to be flattened. See AEDesc.

`buffer`  

A pointer to memory, allocated by the application, where the flattened data will be stored. See the `bufferSize` parameter for information on how large a buffer you should allocate.

`bufferSize`  

The size of the buffer pointed to by buffer. Prior to calling `AEFlattenDesc`, you call the AESizeOfFlattenedDesc(_:) function to determine the required size of the buffer for the flatten operation.

If `bufferSize` is too small, `AEFlattenDesc` returns `errAEBufferTooSmall` and doesnâ€™t store any data in the buffer.

`actualSize`  

A pointer to a size variable. On return, the variable contains the actual size of the flattened data. You can specify `NULL` for this parameter if you do not care about the returned size.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

Flattening a descriptor serializes the data it contains. That is, it reduces a complex, possibly deeply nested structure to a series of bytes that can conveniently be stored. The descriptor can be reconstituted from the stored bytes with the AEUnflattenDesc(_:_:) function.

Applications can be scriptable and work with Apple events without needing to flatten and unflatten descriptors. Flattening is a special-purpose capability that is useful in circumstances where it may be convenient to store data by saving and restoring a descriptor, rather than having to manually extract the data from it, store the data as a separate step, then manually recreate the descriptor (if necessary). For example, you might use flattening to store a preference setting received through an Apple event.

Flattening and unflattening should work without loss of data on descriptors that represent `AEDesc`, `AEList`, and `AERecord` structures. You can also use the process with `AppleEvent` descriptors. However, keep in mind that Apple events may contain attributes that are relevant only to a running process, and these attributes may not keep their meaning when the event is reconstituted.

Flattening and unflattening works across OS versions, including between Mac OS 9 and macOS.

Flattening is endian-neutral. That is, you can save flattened data on a machine that is either big-endian or little-endian, then retrieve and unflatten the data on either type of machine, without any special steps by your application.

### Version-Notes

Thread safe starting in OS X v10.2.
