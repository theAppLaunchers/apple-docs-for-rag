## Discussion

The user interaction preferenceâ€”the server application should never interact with the user in response to the Apple event. If you set the bit specified by this constant, the `AEInteractWithUser(_:_:_:)` function (when called by the server) returns the `errAENoUserInteraction` result code. When you send an Apple event to a remote application, the default is to set this bit.
