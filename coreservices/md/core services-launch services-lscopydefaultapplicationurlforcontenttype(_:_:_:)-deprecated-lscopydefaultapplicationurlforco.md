Function

# LSCopyDefaultApplicationURLForContentType(\_:\_:\_:)

Returns the app that opens a content type.

macOS 10.10â€“12.0Deprecated

``` source
func LSCopyDefaultApplicationURLForContentType(
    _ inContentType: CFString,
    _ inRoleMask: LSRolesMask,
    _ outError: UnsafeMutablePointer?>?
) -> Unmanaged?
```

## Parameters 

`inContentType`  

The Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) of the item for which the app is requested.

`inRoleMask`  

Whether to return the editor or viewer for `inContentType`. If you don't care which, use all.

`outError`  

On failure, set to a CFError describing the problem. If you are not interested in this information, pass `NULL`. The caller is responsible for releasing this object.

## Return Value

If an acceptable app is found, its URL is returned. If no app could be found, `NULL` is returned and `outError` (if not `NULL`) is populated with kLSApplicationNotFoundErr. The caller is responsible for releasing this URL.

## Discussion

Consults the binding tables to return the application that would be used to open a file of type `inContentType` if it were double-clicked in the Finder. This app will be the user-specified override if appropriate or the default otherwise.
