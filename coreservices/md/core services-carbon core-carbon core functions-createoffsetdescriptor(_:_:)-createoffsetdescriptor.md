Function

# CreateOffsetDescriptor(\_:\_:)

Creates an offset descriptor that specifies the position of an element in relation to the beginning or end of its container.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
func CreateOffsetDescriptor(
    _ theOffset: Int,
    _ theDescriptor: UnsafeMutablePointer!
) -> OSErr
```

## Parameters 

`theOffset`  

A positive integer that specifies the offset from the beginning of the container (the first element has an offset of 1), or a negative integer that specifies the offset from the end (the last element has an offset of â€“1).

`theDescriptor`  

A pointer to a descriptor. On successful return, the offset descriptor created by `CreateOffsetDescriptor`. On error, returns a null descriptor. Your application must dispose of the descriptor after it has finished using it. See AEDesc.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.
