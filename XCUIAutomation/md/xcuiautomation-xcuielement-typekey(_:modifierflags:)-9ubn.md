``` source
@MainActor
func typeKey(
    _ key: String,
    modifierFlags flags: XCUIElement.KeyModifierFlags
)
```

## Parameters 

`key`  

A string representation of the key to type, or a constant from XCUIKeyboardKey for a key that doesnâ€™t have a single-key string equivalent.

`flags`  

A set of modifier flags (XCUIElement.KeyModifierFlags) to use when typing the key.

## Discussion

Although `key` is a string, it must represent a single key on a physical keyboard. Strings that resolve to multiple keys raise an error at runtime.

In addition to literal string key representations like `"a"`, `"6"`, and `"["`, keys such as arrow keys, Command, Control, Option, and function keys can be typed using the constants in XCUIKeyboardKey.
