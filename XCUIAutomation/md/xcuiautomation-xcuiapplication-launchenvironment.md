## Discussion

If not modified, these are the environment variables that Xcode passes to the application on launch. You can change, add to, or remove the environment variables. Unlike with Process, you can modify the environment variables after the application launches. Such changes donâ€™t affect the current launch session, but do take effect the next time the application launches.
