## Discussion

If not modified, these are the arguments that Xcode passes to the application on launch. You can change, add to, or remove the arguments. Unlike with Process, you can also modify these arguments after the application launches. Such changes donâ€™t affect the current launch session, but do take effect the next time the application launches.
