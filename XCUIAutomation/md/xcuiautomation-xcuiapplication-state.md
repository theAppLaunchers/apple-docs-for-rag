## Discussion

The system monitors the app to update this property as the appâ€™s state changes. Consequently, the system updates the value of this property asynchronously.

The system makes the following guarantees:

- When launch() and activate() return successfully, the state of the application is XCUIApplication.State.runningForeground. An exception to this is launching or activating a macOS agent application with LSUIElement set in its `Info.plist `file. This kind of application never gains foreground status and its state is XCUIApplication.State.runningBackground instead.

- When terminate() returns successfully, the state of the application is XCUIApplication.State.notRunning.
