## Mentioned in 

Track custom objects in a frame

## Overview

This object represents an observation about a single video frame, including information about the type of subject, the coordinates of the subject, and the angle of the subjectâ€™s face. DockKit generates tracking vectors from this frame information. When performing your own tracking, you provide one or more DockAccessory.Observation objects to track(_:cameraInformation:).

## Topics

### Creating an observation

init(identifier: Int, type: DockAccessory.Observation.ObservationType, rect: CGRect, faceYawAngle: Measurement&lt;UnitAngle>?)

Creates a new observation.

### Getting properties

let faceYawAngle: Measurement&lt;UnitAngle>?

The angle of the face in radians.

let rect: CGRect

The coordinates of the subject in the frame.

let type: DockAccessory.Observation.ObservationType

The type of subject in the frame.

let identifier: Int

A unique identifier representing the subject in the frame.

### Defining types

enum ObservationType

The available observation types.
