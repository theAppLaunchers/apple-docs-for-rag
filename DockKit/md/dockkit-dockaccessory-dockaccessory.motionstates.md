## Topics

### Iterating over motion states

struct Iterator

An object that allows iteration over dock accessory motion states.

func makeAsyncIterator() -> DockAccessory.MotionStates.Iterator

Creates and returns an iterator that traverses the list of dock accessory motion states.

typealias Element

A dock accessory motion state.

### Type Aliases

typealias AsyncIterator

The type of asynchronous iterator that produces elements of this asynchronous sequence.

var limits: DockAccessory.Limits

Current limits for the axes of rotation and maximum angular velocity.

struct MotionState

An event that indicates the state of a dock accessoryâ€™s current position and speed.

struct Limits

Soft limits on multiple axes of rotation.
