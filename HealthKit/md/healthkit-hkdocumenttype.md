``` source
class HKDocumentType
```

## Overview

To create a document type instance, use the HKObjectType class’s documentType(forIdentifier:) convenience method.

### Subclassing Notes

Like many HealthKit classes, document types are not extensible and should not be subclassed.

Additionally, this class reuses the same instance whenever possible. Letting multiple queries share the same document type helps reduce the overall memory usage.
