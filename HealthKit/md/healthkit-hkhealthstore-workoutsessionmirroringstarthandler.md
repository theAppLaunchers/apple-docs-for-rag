Instance Property

# workoutSessionMirroringStartHandler

A block that the system calls when it starts a mirrored workout session.

iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOSvisionOS 1.0+watchOS 10.0+

``` source
var workoutSessionMirroringStartHandler: ((HKWorkoutSession) -> Void)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The system calls this block on the companion iPhone when someone starts a mirrored workout on Apple Watch. If your iOS app isnâ€™t active, the system launches it in the background.

```
// The HealthKit store calls this closure when Apple Watch starts a remote session.
store.workoutSessionMirroringStartHandler = { mirroredSession in
    // Reset the health data.
    self.data = HealthData()

    // Save a reference to the workout session.
    self.session = mirroredSession
    logger.debug("*** A session started on the companion Apple Watch. ***")
}
```

To ensure that your app can always catch incoming mirrored workout sessions, assign this property as soon as your app launches.

Important

Your app may receive multiple calls to workoutSessionMirroringStartHandler. If iPhone and Apple Watch lose their connection in the middle of a workout session, Apple Watch automatically tries to reconnect. Each call has its own HKWorkoutSession instance.

The system calls this block from an arbitrary background queue.
