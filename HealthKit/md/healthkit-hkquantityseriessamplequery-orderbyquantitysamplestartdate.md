## Discussion

By default the query returns all the quantities in ascending order based on their start date. If you set this property to true, HealthKit first sorts the matching HKQuantitySample objects by their startDate parameter. Then, for each sample, it returns all the quantity objects in ascending order. If the sample objects overlap, then the quantities may not appear in ascending order when switching from one sample to the next.
