# HKSampleType

An abstract superclass for all classes that identify a specific type of sample when working with the HealthKit store.

``` source

```

## Overview

The HKSampleType class is an abstract subclass of the HKObjectType class, used to represent data samples. Never instantiate an HKSampleType object directly. Instead, work with one of its concrete subclasses: HKCategoryType, HKCorrelationType, HKQuantityType, or HKWorkoutType classes.

## Topics

### Checking the Duration Restriction

var isMinimumDurationRestricted: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether samples of this type have a minimum time interval between the start and end dates.

var minimumAllowedDuration: TimeInterval

The minimum duration if the sample type has a restricted duration.

var isMaximumDurationRestricted: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether samples of this type have a maximum time interval between the start and end dates.

var maximumAllowedDuration: TimeInterval

The maximum duration if the sample type has a restricted duration.

### Checking on Recalibrating Estimates

var allowsRecalibrationForEstimates: Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether HealthKit supports recalibrating the prediction algorithm used to produce estimates for this sample type.
