## Discussion

Move time measures every full minute where the watch detects the user actively moving. Apple Watch uses the accelerometer and gyroscopes to detect activities that involve full-body movements, like walking, running, or playing in the playground.

For younger users, the Activity app’s Move ring (and HealthKit’s related activity summary) can track move time instead of active energy burned:

- HealthKit automatically tracks move time for any users under 13 years old.

- Users 13 to 18 years old can choose whether to track move time or active calorie burn.

- All users over 18 years old track active calorie burn.
