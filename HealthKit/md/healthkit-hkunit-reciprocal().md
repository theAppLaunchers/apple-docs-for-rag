``` source
func reciprocal() -> HKUnit
```

## Return Value

A complex unit that is the reciprocal of the unit the method was called on.

## Discussion

This method creates a new, complex unit by dividing 1 by the unit the method was called on. This is often only one step in a series of operations. For example, you can use this method to create a meters-per-second unit, as shown below.

- Swift
- Objective-C

```
let meters = HKUnit.meterUnit()
let seconds = HKUnit.secondUnit()
let secondsInverse = seconds.reciprocalUnit()
let metersPerSecond = meters.unitMultipliedByUnit(secondsInverse)
```

```
HKUnit *meters = [HKUnit meterUnit];
HKUnit *seconds = [HKUnit secondUnit];
HKUnit *secondsInverse = [seconds reciprocalUnit];
HKUnit *metersPerSecond = [meters unitMultipliedByUnit:secondsInverse];
```
