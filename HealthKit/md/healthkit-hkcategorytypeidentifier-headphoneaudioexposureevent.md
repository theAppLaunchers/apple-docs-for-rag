## Discussion

iPhone and Apple Watch save a headphoneAudioExposureEvent sample when the device generates a notification about loud headphone audio. Both devices generate these notifications when the user listens to audio long enough and at a volume that could affect their hearing. In some regions, users can enable or disable loud headphone notifications from Settings \> Sounds & Haptics \> Headphone Safety.

Samples of this type use values from the HKCategoryValueHeadphoneAudioExposureEvent enumeration.
