Instance Property

# shouldCollectWorkoutEvents

A Boolean value that determines whether the workout builder automatically adds events generated by the workout session.

``` source
var shouldCollectWorkoutEvents: Bool { get set }
```

## Mentioned in 

Running workout sessions

## Discussion

By default, this property is true. Set it to false if your app adds its own events to the workout builder, and you want to ignore events from the workout session.

You must set this property before calling the workout builder’s beginCollection(withStart:completion:) method.
