## Mentioned in 

Accessing condensed workout samples

## Overview

Use a series query to access the individual HKQuantity objects added to a sample using an HKQuantitySeriesSampleBuilder.

Important

For many common calculations, consider using a statistical query instead. Statistical queries correctly handle quantity data, whether the samples represent a single quantity or a series.

## Topics

### Creating a Series Query

init(quantityType: HKQuantityType, predicate: NSPredicate?, quantityHandler: (HKQuantitySeriesSampleQuery, HKQuantity?, DateInterval?, HKQuantitySample?, Bool, (any Error)?) -> Void)

Creates a new query for a series of the specified quantity type.

var includeSample: Bool

A Boolean value that determines whether the query should return the series sample.

var orderByQuantitySampleStartDate: Bool

A Boolean value that determines whether the query groups the results based on the quantity sampleâ€™s start date.

### Deprecated Mehtods

init(sample: HKQuantitySample, quantityHandler: (HKQuantitySeriesSampleQuery, HKQuantity?, Date?, Bool, (any Error)?) -> Void)

Creates a new series query.

Deprecated
