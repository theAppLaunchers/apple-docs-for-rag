## Discussion

Most event types support only date intervals with a zero-length duration. These intervals indicate a single point in time, represented by the intervalâ€™s startDate property. Only HKWorkoutEventType.lap and HKWorkoutEventType.segment event types support intervals with nonzero durations.
