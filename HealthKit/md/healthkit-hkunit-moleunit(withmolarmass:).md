``` source
class func moleUnit(withMolarMass gramsPerMole: Double) -> Self
```

## Parameters 

`gramsPerMole`  

The molar mass (in g/mol) of the item to be weighed.

## Return Value

A HealthKit unit for measuring the mass of an item in moles.

## Discussion

To create a unit for measuring an item in moles, you need to know that itemâ€™s molar mass. For example, you can use the HKUnitMolarMassBloodGlucose constant to create the mole unit for blood glucose, as shown below.

- Swift
- Objective-C

```
let molesOfBloodGlucose = HKUnit.moleUnitWithMolarMass(HKUnitMolarMassBloodGlucose)
```

```
HKUnit *molesOfBloodGlucose =
[HKUnit moleUnitWithMolarMass:HKUnitMolarMassBloodGlucose];
```
