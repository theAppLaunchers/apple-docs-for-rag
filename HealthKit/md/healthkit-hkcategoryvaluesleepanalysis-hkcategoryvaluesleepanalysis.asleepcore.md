## Discussion

This value corresponds to stage N2 of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine’s scoring model. Stage N2 is also referred to as light or intermediate sleep. It accounts for a major part of the time spent asleep. The HKCategoryValueSleepAnalysis.asleepCore value also includes stage N1, which makes up only a small portion of the night.
