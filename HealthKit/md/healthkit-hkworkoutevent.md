## Overview

You can use workout events to toggle a workout between an active and an inactive state, or to mark points of interest during a workout.

Workouts start in an active state. A pause event switches it to an inactive state; a resume event switches it back to an active state. Adding a pause event when the workout is already inactive, or a resume event when the workout is already active, does not affect the workoutâ€™s state. These events are ignored.

The lap, segment, and marker events are used to identify periods of interest during a workout. Use lap events to partition a workout into segments of equal distance. Segment events mark important periods during the workout, while markers identify important points in time.
