## Overview

A quantity typeâ€™s aggregation style determines the type of statistics queries that you can perform. Discrete types support average, minimum, and maximum queries. Cumulative types support only sum queries. For more information, see HKStatisticsQuery.

## Topics

### Aggregation Styles

case cumulative

Cumulative samples that can be summed over time.

case discreteArithmetic

Discrete samples that can be averaged over time using an arithmetic mean.

case discreteTemporallyWeighted

Discrete samples that can be averaged over a time interval using a temporally weighted integration function.

case discreteEquivalentContinuousLevel

Discrete samples that can be combined over a time interval by computing the equivalent continuous sound level.

### Deprecated Styles
