``` source
class func predicateForWorkouts(with workoutActivityType: HKWorkoutActivityType) -> NSPredicate
```

## Parameters 

`workoutActivityType`  

The type of activity. For a list of valid workout activities, see HKWorkoutActivityType.

## Return Value

A predicate for matching workouts based on the type of activity.

## Discussion

Use this convenience method to create a predicate that matches workouts based on their activity. The following sample uses both the convenience method and a predicate format string to create equivalent predicates.

- Swift
- Objective-C

```
let workout = HKQuery.predicateForWorkoutsWithWorkoutActivityType(.Curling)

let explicitWorkout = NSPredicate(format: "%K == %d",
                                  HKPredicateKeyPathWorkoutType,
                                  HKWorkoutActivityType.Curling.rawValue)
```

```
NSPredicate *workout =
    [HKQuery predicateForWorkoutsWithWorkoutActivityType:
     HKWorkoutActivityTypeCurling];

NSPredicate *explicitWorkout =
[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"%K == %d",
 HKPredicateKeyPathWorkoutType,
 HKWorkoutActivityTypeCurling];
```
