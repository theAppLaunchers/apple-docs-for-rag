``` source
func insert(
    _ quantity: HKQuantity,
    at date: Date
) throws
```

## Parameters 

`quantity`  

The quantity to insert.

`date`  

The start date associated with the quantity. If this is the same start date as a previously provided quantity, this quantity replaces the previous one. This method fails with an HKError.Code.errorInvalidArgument error if the `date` parameter is earlier than the series builderâ€™s startDate property.

## Discussion

This method calls insert(_:for:), passing a date interval with the provided start date, and a duration of `0`.
