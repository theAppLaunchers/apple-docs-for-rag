## Discussion

Use this method to add an attachment to an object in the HealthKit store. You can add more than one attachment to the specified object.

To add an attachment, start by creating an attachment store.

```
// Get the attachment store.
let attachmentStore = HKAttachmentStore(healthStore: store)
```

Next, add the attachment to an object that youâ€™ve already saved to the HealthKit store.

```
// Attach the image to the sample.
do {
    _ = try await attachmentStore.addAttachment(to: prescription,
                                                name: "Glasses Prescription",
                                                contentType: type,
                                                url: url)
} catch {
    // Handle the error.
    fatalError("*** An error occurred while attaching the image: \(error.localizedDescription) ***")
}
```

You can only add attachments to HKVisionPrescription, HKGlassesPrescription, and HKContactsPrescription samples. The attachment must be a static image or PDF (no videos or GIFs). HealthKit supports attaching Live Photos, however it automatically selects and attaches the key photo.
