## Discussion

Use this type to read or share handwashing events. When creating a handwashing event sample, set the value to HKCategoryValue.notApplicable, and set the duration by specifying different start and end dates. The Health app uses the sampleâ€™s duration to determine if the handwashing event completed.

Apple Watch automatically detects and records handwashing events on Apple Watch Series 4 and later.
