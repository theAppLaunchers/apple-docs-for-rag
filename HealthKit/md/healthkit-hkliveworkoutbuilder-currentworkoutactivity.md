## Discussion

This property contains a workout activity that’s currently in progress, an activity with an endDate property set to `nil`. If you end the activity — for example, by calling endCurrentActivity(on:) or updateActivity(uuid:end:completion:) — the system sets this property to `nil` until you begin a new activity.
