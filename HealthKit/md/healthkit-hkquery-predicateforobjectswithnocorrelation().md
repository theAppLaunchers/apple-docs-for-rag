``` source
class func predicateForObjectsWithNoCorrelation() -> NSPredicate
```

## Return Value

A predicate that matches all objects that are not associated with any HealthKit correlations.

## Discussion

Use this convenience method to create a predicate that matches all objects not associated with a HKCorrelation object. The following sample uses both the convenience method and a predicate format string to create equivalent predicates.

- Swift
- Objective-C

```
let noncorrelated = HKQuery.predicateForObjectsWithNoCorrelation()

let explicitNoncorrelated =
    NSPredicate(format: "%K == nil", HKPredicateKeyPathCorrelation)
```

```
NSPredicate *noncorrelated = [HKQuery predicateForObjectsWithNoCorrelation];

NSPredicate *explicitNoncorrelated =
[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"%K == nil", HKPredicateKeyPathCorrelation];
```
