``` source
class func predicateForObject(with UUID: UUID) -> NSPredicate
```

## Parameters 

`UUID`  

The target UUID.

## Return Value

A predicate that matches a specific object based on its UUID.

## Discussion

HealthKit assigns a UUID to each object when it is saved to the HealthKit store. HealthKit uses these IDs to uniquely identify objects from the store. Use this convenience method to create a predicate that matches the object with the provided UUID. The following sample uses both the convenience method and a predicate format string to create equivalent predicates.

- Swift
- Objective-C

```
let uuid = HKQuery.predicateForObjectWithUUID(myUUID)
let explicitUUID = NSPredicate(format: "%K == %@", HKPredicateKeyPathUUID, myUUID)
```

```
NSPredicate *uuid = [HKQuery predicateForObjectWithUUID:myUUID];

NSPredicate *explicitUUID = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"%K == %@",
                             HKPredicateKeyPathUUID,
                             myUUID];
```
