Type Method

# predicateForWorkoutActivities(start:end:options:)

Returns a predicate for workout activities that occur between the start and end date.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 9.0+

``` source
class func predicateForWorkoutActivities(
    start startDate: Date?,
    end endDate: Date?,
    options: HKQueryOptions = []
) -> NSPredicate
```

## Parameters 

`startDate`  

The start date for the target time interval.

`endDate`  

The end date for the target time interval.

`options`  

A constant that specifies how HealthKit compares the sampleâ€™s start and end date with the target time interval. For a list of possible values, see HKQueryOptions.

## Discussion

Use this convenience method to create a predicate that matches workout activities that occur between the specified start and end dates. To use this predicate, call predicateForWorkouts(activityPredicate:) to wrap this predicate inside a workout predicate. You can then use the workout predicate in your query.

The following sample creates a predicate for workout activities within the last 30 minutes.

```
let end = Date()
let start = end.advanced(by: -30.0 * 60.0)

let recentActivityPredicate =
HKQuery.predicateForWorkoutActivities(start: start, end: end)

let workoutPredicate =
HKQuery.predicateForWorkouts(activityPredicate: recentActivityPredicate)
```
