## Discussion

This method creates a new, complex unit by dividing one unit by another. For example, you can create a meters-per-second unit by dividing a meters unit by a seconds unit, as shown below.

- Swift
- Objective-C

```
let meters = HKUnit.meterUnit()
let seconds = HKUnit.secondUnit()
let metersPerSecond = meters.unitDividedByUnit(seconds)
```

```
HKUnit *meters = [HKUnit meterUnit];
HKUnit *seconds = [HKUnit secondUnit];
HKUnit *metersPerSecond = [meters unitDividedByUnit:seconds];
```
