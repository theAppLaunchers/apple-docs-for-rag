Constants indicating the authorization status for a particular data type.

``` source
enum HKAuthorizationStatus
```

## Overview

This status indicates whether the user has authorized your app to save data of the given type.

To help maintain the privacy of sensitive health data, HealthKit does not tell you when the user denies your app permission to query data. Instead, it simply appears as if HealthKit does not have any data matching your query. Your app will receive only the data that it has written to HealthKit. Data from other sources remains hidden from your app. For more information on privacy in HealthKit, see `HealthKit`.
