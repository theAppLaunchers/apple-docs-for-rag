Receiving Downhill Skiing and Snowboarding Data

## Discussion

Set this key on a workout, workout segment, or a quantity sample that represents distance. Set its value to an HKQuantity object with a length/time unit (for example, m/s). For more information on creating complex units, see Performing unit math.

HealthKit assigns this metadata key to the segments it automatically creates for HKWorkoutActivityType.downhillSkiing and HKWorkoutActivityType.snowboarding workout sessions (Apple Watch Series 3 only).

Note

This value represents the average speed while moving. It may not be the same as the value you get when dividing a distance sampleâ€™s distance by its duration.
