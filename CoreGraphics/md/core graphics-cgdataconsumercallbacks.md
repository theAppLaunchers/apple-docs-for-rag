``` source
struct CGDataConsumerCallbacks
```

## Overview

The functions specified by the `CGDataConsumerCallbacks` structure are responsible for copying data that Core Graphics sends to your consumer and for handling the consumerâ€™s basic memory management. You supply this structure to the function init(info:cbks:) to create a data consumer.

## Topics

### Initializers

init()

init(putBytes: CGDataConsumerPutBytesCallback?, releaseConsumer: CGDataConsumerReleaseInfoCallback?)

### Instance Properties

var putBytes: CGDataConsumerPutBytesCallback?

A pointer to a function that copies data to the data consumer. For more information, see CGDataConsumerPutBytesCallback.

var releaseConsumer: CGDataConsumerReleaseInfoCallback?

A pointer to a function that handles clean-up for the data consumer, or `NULL`.
