Instance Method

# setPatternPhase(\_:)

Sets the pattern phase of a context.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.0+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
func setPatternPhase(_ phase: CGSize)
```

## Parameters 

`phase`  

A pattern phase, specified in user space.

## Discussion

The pattern phase is a translation that Core Graphics applies prior to drawing a pattern in the context. The pattern phase is part of the graphics state of a context, and the default pattern phase is `(0,0)`. Setting the pattern phase has the effect of temporarily changing the pattern matrix of any pattern you draw. For example, setting the contextâ€™s pattern phase to `(2,3)` has the effect of moving the start of pattern cell tiling to the point `(2,3)` in default user space.
