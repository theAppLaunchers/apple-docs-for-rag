## Overview

A line cap specifies the method used by strokePath() to draw the endpoint of the line. To change the line cap style in a graphics context, you use the function setLineCap(_:).

## Topics

### Constants

case butt

A line with a squared-off end. Core Graphics draws the line to extend only to the exact endpoint of the path. This is the default.

case round

A line with a rounded end. Core Graphics draws the line to extend beyond the endpoint of the path. The line ends with a semicircular arc with a radius of 1/2 the lineâ€™s width, centered on the endpoint.

case square

A line with a squared-off end. Core Graphics extends the line beyond the endpoint of the path for a distance equal to half the line width.
