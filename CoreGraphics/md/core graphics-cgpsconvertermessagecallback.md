Type Alias

# CGPSConverterMessageCallback

Passes messages generated during a PostScript conversion process.

Mac CatalystmacOS

``` source
typealias CGPSConverterMessageCallback = (UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, CFString) -> Void
```

## Parameters 

`info`  

A generic pointer to private data shared among your callback functions. This is the same pointer you supplied to init(info:callbacks:options:).

`message`  

A string containing the message from the PostScript conversion process.

## Discussion

There are several kinds of message that might be sent during a conversion process. The most likely are font substitution messages, and any messages that the PostScript code itself generates. Any PostScript messages written to `stdout` are routed through this callbackâ€”typically these are debugging or status messages and, although uncommon, can be useful in debugging. In addition, there may be error messages if the document is malformed.
