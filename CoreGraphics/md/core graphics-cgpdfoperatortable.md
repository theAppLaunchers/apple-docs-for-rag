# CGPDFOperatorTable

A set of callback functions for operators used when scanning content in a PDF document.

## Overview

You pass an operator table and a PDF content stream to a CGPDFScanner object. When the scanner parses a PDF operator, Core Graphics invokes your callback for that operator. See also CGPDFScanner and CGPDFContentStream.

Note

This object is not derived from CFType and therefore you canâ€™t use the Core Foundation base functions on it, such as CFRetain and CFRelease. In Objective-C, handle memory management with CGPDFOperatorTableRetain(_:) and CGPDFOperatorTableRelease(_:).

For more about PDF operators, see the latest version of *PDF Reference*, Adobe Systems Incorporated.
