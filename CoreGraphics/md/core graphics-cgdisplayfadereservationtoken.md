``` source
typealias CGDisplayFadeReservationToken = UInt32
```

## Discussion

Quartz lets you reserve the display hardware to perform a fade operation. Fade reservations are valid for up to 15 seconds. Only one token is needed for both fade-out and fade-in.

You should release a fade reservation immediately when you no longer need it. If the reservation expires, releasing it is safe but not necessary.
