Instance Method

# addLines(between:)

Adds a sequence of connected straight-line segments to the current path.

``` source
func addLines(between points: [CGPoint])
```

## Parameters 

`points`  

An array of values that specify the start and end points of the line segments to draw. Each point in the array specifies a position in user space. The first point in the array specifies the initial starting point.

## Discussion

Calling this convenience method is equivalent to calling the move(to:) method with the first value in the points array, then calling the addLine(to:) method for each subsequent point until the array is exhausted. After calling this method, the path’s current point is the last point in the array.
