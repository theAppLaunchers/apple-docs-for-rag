``` source
typealias CGDataConsumerPutBytesCallback = (UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, UnsafeRawPointer, Int) -> Int
```

## Parameters 

`info`  

A generic pointer to private data shared among your callback functions. This is the pointer supplied to init(info:cbks:).

`buffer`  

The buffer from which you copy the specified number of bytes.

`count`  

The number of bytes to copy.

## Return Value

The number of bytes copied. If no more data can be written to the consumer, you should return `0`.

## Discussion

When Core Graphics is ready to send data to the consumer, your function is called. It should copy the specified number of bytes from `buffer` into some resource under your controlâ€”for example, a file.

For information on how to associate your callback function with a data consumer, see init(info:cbks:) and CGDataConsumerCallbacks.
