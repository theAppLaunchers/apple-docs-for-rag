Structure

# CGDataProviderSequentialCallbacks

Defines a structure containing pointers to client-defined callback functions that manage the sending of data for a sequential-access data provider.

struct CGDataProviderSequentialCallbacks
```

## Overview

The functions specified by the `CGDataProviderSequentialCallbacks` structure are responsible for sequentially copying data to a memory buffer for Core Graphics to use. The functions are also responsible for handling the data providerâ€™s basic memory management. You supply a `CGDataProviderSequentialCallbacks` structure to the function init(sequentialInfo:callbacks:) to create a sequential-access data provider.

## Topics

### Initializers

init()

init(version: UInt32, getBytes: CGDataProviderGetBytesCallback?, skipForward: CGDataProviderSkipForwardCallback?, rewind: CGDataProviderRewindCallback?, releaseInfo: CGDataProviderReleaseInfoCallback?)

### Instance Properties

var getBytes: CGDataProviderGetBytesCallback?

A pointer to a function that copies data from the provider. For more information, see CGDataProviderGetBytesCallback.

var releaseInfo: CGDataProviderReleaseInfoCallback?

A pointer to a function that handles clean-up for the data provider, or `NULL`. For more information, see CGDataProviderReleaseInfoCallback.

var rewind: CGDataProviderRewindCallback?

A pointer to a function Core Graphics calls to return the provider to the beginning of the data stream. For more information, see CGDataProviderRewindCallback.

var skipForward: CGDataProviderSkipForwardCallback?

A pointer to a function that Core Graphics calls to advance the stream of data supplied by the provider.

var version: UInt32

The version of this structure. It should be set to 0.
