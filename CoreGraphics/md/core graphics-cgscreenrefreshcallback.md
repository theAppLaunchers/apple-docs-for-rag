# CGScreenRefreshCallback

A client-supplied callback function that’s invoked when an area of the display is modified or refreshed.

Mac CatalystmacOS

``` source
typealias CGScreenRefreshCallback = (UInt32, UnsafePointer, UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Void
```

## Parameters 

`count`  

The number of rectangles in the `rectArray` parameter.

`rectArray`  

A list of the rectangles in the refreshed areas, specified in the global display coordinate space. The origin is the upper-left corner of the main display. You should not modify or deallocate memory pointed to by `rectArray`.

`userParameter`  

The user data you specify when you register this callback.

## Discussion

To register a screen-refresh callback function, you call the function CGRegisterScreenRefreshCallback(_:_:). Quartz invokes your callback function when operations such as drawing, window movement, scrolling, or display reconfiguration occur on local displays. When you finish using a callback registration, you should call the function CGUnregisterScreenRefreshCallback(_:_:) to remove it.

Note that a single rectangle may occupy multiple displays, either by overlapping the displays or by residing on coincident displays when mirroring is active. You can use the function CGGetDisplaysWithRect(_:_:_:_:) to determine the displays a rectangle occupies.
