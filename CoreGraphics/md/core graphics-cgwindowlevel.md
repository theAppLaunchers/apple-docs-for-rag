Type Alias

# CGWindowLevel

A level assigned to a window by an application framework.

Mac CatalystmacOS

``` source
typealias CGWindowLevel = Int32
```

## Discussion

In macOS, application frameworks support the concept of multiple window levels (or layers). Window levels are assigned and managed by each individual framework.

Note that in an Aqua-compliant application, each document window exists in its own layer. As a result, windows created by different applications can be interleaved.

## Topics
