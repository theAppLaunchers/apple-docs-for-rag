# init(data:)

Creates a data consumer that writes to a CFData object.

iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.4+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+

``` source
init?(data: CFMutableData)
```

## Parameters 

`data`  

The CFData object to write to.

## Return Value

A new data consumer object. In Objective-C, youâ€™re responsible for releasing this object using CGDataConsumerRelease.

## Discussion

You can use this function when you need to represent Core Graphics data as a CFData type. For example, you might create a CFData object that you then copy to the pasteboard.
