# CGDataProvider

An abstraction for data-reading tasks that eliminates the need to manage a raw memory buffer.

## Overview

Data provider objects abstract the data-access task and eliminate the need for applications to manage data through a raw memory buffer.

For information on how to use CGDataProvider functions, see Quartz 2D Programming Guide Programming Guide.

See also CGDataConsumer.

## Topics

### Creating Sequential-Access Data Providers

init?(sequentialInfo: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, callbacks: UnsafePointer&lt;CGDataProviderSequentialCallbacks>)

Creates a sequential-access data provider.

struct CGDataProviderSequentialCallbacks

Defines a structure containing pointers to client-defined callback functions that manage the sending of data for a sequential-access data provider.

typealias CGDataProviderRewindCallback

A callback function that moves the current position in the data stream back to the beginning.

typealias CGDataProviderGetBytesCallback

A callback function that copies from a provider data stream into a Core Graphics buffer.

typealias CGDataProviderSkipForwardCallback

A callback function that advances the current position in the data stream supplied by the provider.

typealias CGDataProviderReleaseInfoCallback

A callback function that releases any private data or resources associated with the data provider.

### Creating Direct-Access Data Providers

init?(directInfo: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, size: off_t, callbacks: UnsafePointer&lt;CGDataProviderDirectCallbacks>)

Creates a direct-access data provider.

init?(data: CFData)

Creates a data provider that reads from a CFData object.

init?(url: CFURL)

Creates a direct-access data provider that uses a URL to supply data.

init?(dataInfo: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, data: UnsafeRawPointer, size: Int, releaseData: CGDataProviderReleaseDataCallback)

Creates a direct-access data provider that uses data your program supplies.

init?(filename: UnsafePointer&lt;CChar>)

Creates a direct-access data provider that uses a file to supply data.

struct CGDataProviderDirectCallbacks

Defines pointers to client-defined callback functions that manage the sending of data for a direct-access data provider.

typealias CGDataProviderGetBytePointerCallback

A callback function that returns a generic pointer to the provider data.

typealias CGDataProviderGetBytesAtPositionCallback

A callback function that copies data from the provider into a Core Graphics buffer.

typealias CGDataProviderReleaseBytePointerCallback

A callback function that releases the pointer Core Graphics obtained by calling CGDataProviderGetBytePointerCallback.

typealias CGDataProviderReleaseInfoCallback

A callback function that releases any private data or resources associated with the data provider.

typealias CGDataProviderReleaseDataCallback

A callback function that releases data you supply to the function init(dataInfo:data:size:releaseData:).

### Getting Data from a Data Provider

var data: CFData?

Returns a copy of the providerâ€™s data.

### Working with Core Foundation Types

class var typeID: CFTypeID

Returns the Core Foundation type identifier for data providers.

### Instance Properties

var info: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?
