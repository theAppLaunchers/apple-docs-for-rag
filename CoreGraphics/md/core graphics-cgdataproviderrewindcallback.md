``` source
typealias CGDataProviderRewindCallback = (UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Void
```

## Parameters 

`info`  

A generic pointer to private data shared among your callback functions. This is the same pointer you supplied to init(version:getBytes:skipForward:rewind:releaseInfo:).

## Discussion

When Core Graphics needs to read from the beginning of the providerâ€™s data stream, your function is called.

For information on how to associate your callback function with a data provider, see CGDataProvider and CGDataProviderSequentialCallbacks.
