``` source
init?(url: CFURL)
```

## Parameters 

`url`  

A CFURL object for the URL that you want to read the data from.

## Return Value

A new data provider or `NULL` if the data from the URL could not be accessed. In Objective-C, youâ€™re responsible for releasing this object using CGDataProviderRelease.

## Discussion

You use this function to create a direct-access data provider that supplies data from a URL. When you supply Core Graphics with a direct-access data provider, Core Graphics obtains data from your program in a single entire block.
