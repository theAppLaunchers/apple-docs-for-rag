``` source
typealias CGPatternDrawPatternCallback = (UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, CGContext) -> Void
```

## Parameters 

`info`  

A generic pointer to private data associated with the pattern. This is the same pointer you supplied to init(info:bounds:matrix:xStep:yStep:tiling:isColored:callbacks:).

`context`  

The graphics context for drawing the pattern cell.

## Discussion

When a pattern is used to stroke or fill a graphics path,Quartz calls your custom drawing function at the appropriatetime to draw the pattern cell. The cell should be drawn exactly thesame way each time the drawing function is called.

In a drawing function associated with an uncolored pattern,you should not attempt to set a stroke or fill color or color spaceâ€”ifyou do so, the result is undefined.

To learn how to associate your drawing function with a Quartzpattern, see init(info:bounds:matrix:xStep:yStep:tiling:isColored:callbacks:) and CGPatternCallbacks.
