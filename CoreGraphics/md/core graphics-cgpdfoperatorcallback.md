``` source
typealias CGPDFOperatorCallback = (CGPDFScannerRef, UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Void
```

## Parameters 

`scanner`  

A CGPDFScanner object. Core Graphics passes the scanner to your callback function. The scanner contains the PDF content stream that has the PDF operator that corresponds to this callback.

`info`  

A pointer to data passed to the callback.

## Discussion

Your callback function takes any action thatâ€™s appropriate for your application. For example, if you want to count the number of inline images in a PDF but ignore the image data, you would set a callback for the `EI` operator. In your callback you would increment a counter for each call.
