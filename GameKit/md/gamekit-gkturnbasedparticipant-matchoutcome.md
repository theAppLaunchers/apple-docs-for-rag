## Discussion

Initially, GameKit sets this property to GKTurnBasedMatch.Outcome.none. Then before a player forfeits a match or you end a match, set this property to a value that reflects the participantâ€™s outcome. Optionally, set this property to a custom value using an `OR` operation that fits in the range specified by the GKTurnBasedMatch.Outcome.customRange enumeration case.
