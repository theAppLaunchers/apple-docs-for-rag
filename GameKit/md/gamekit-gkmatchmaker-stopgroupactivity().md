## Discussion

Use this method to stop showing a group activity in SharePlay that players use to join a match. This method doesnâ€™t quit the match in your game that players previously join using SharePlay. Players can also stop a group activity using the SharePlay interface.

To start showing a group activity in SharePlay, present a GKMatchmakerViewController object where the player can select SharePlay to invite players, or call the startGroupActivity(playerHandler:) method.
