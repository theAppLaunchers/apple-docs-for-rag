## Overview

A GKLeaderboardScore object represents a score on a leaderboard for scores you report for challenges or turn-based games.

When you create a GKLeaderboardScore object, set the `leaderboardID` property to the associated leaderboard, the `player` property to the player who earns the score, and the `value` property to the score. Make sure the score is compatible with the score format that you configure in App Store Connect.

Then use either the report(_:withEligibleChallenges:withCompletionHandler:) or endMatchInTurn(withMatch:leaderboardScores:achievements:completionHandler:) `GKTurnBasedMatch` method to report one or more scores.

For details about the score format, see Configure leaderboards in App Store Connect Help.
