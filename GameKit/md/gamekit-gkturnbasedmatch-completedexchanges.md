Exchanging data between players in turn-based games

## Discussion

Since only the current participant can save exchanges, this property is `nil` if the local player isnâ€™t the current participant. If the local player is the current player, use the saveMergedMatch(_:withResolvedExchanges:completionHandler:) method to save completed exchanges before ending their turn.
