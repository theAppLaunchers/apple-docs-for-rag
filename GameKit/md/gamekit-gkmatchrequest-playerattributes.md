## Discussion

If the value of this property is `0xFFFFFFFF` (the default), GameKit ignores this property. If the value is nonzero, GameKit uses the value as a mask that restricts the role of the player in the match. GameKit finds new players for the game so that the bitwise OR of all the playerâ€™s masks equals `0xFFFFFFFF`.
