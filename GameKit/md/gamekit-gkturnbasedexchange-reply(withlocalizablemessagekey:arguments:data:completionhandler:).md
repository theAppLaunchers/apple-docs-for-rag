## Discussion

To accept or decline an exchange request, invoke this method from the player(_:receivedExchangeRequest:for:) protocol method. Include game-specific details about the exchange in the `data` parameter. When all recipients reply or time out, GameKit invokes the player(_:receivedExchangeReplies:forCompletedExchange:for:) protocol method in the game instances of the sender and the current participant.
