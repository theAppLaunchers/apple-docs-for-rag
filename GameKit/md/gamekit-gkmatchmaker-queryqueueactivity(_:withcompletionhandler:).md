## Parameters 

`queueName`

The string should be in reverse-DNS format and queue names are case sensitive.

`completionHandler`

This block receives the following parameters:

`activity`  
The number of match requests in the queue during the previous 60 seconds.

`error`  
Describes an error if it occurs, or `nil` if the operation completes.

## Discussion

To specify a queue name when requesting a match, set the `GKMatchRequest` queueName property. For more information, see Matchmaking rules.
