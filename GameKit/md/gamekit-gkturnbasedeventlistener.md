## Overview

To receive the `GKTurnBasedEventListener` call backs, register your game object with the local player object immediately after authentication.

```
GKLocalPlayer.local.register(self)
```

Adopt the GKLocalPlayerListener protocol to handle a variety of Game Center events instead of the individual GKChallengeListener, GKInviteEventListener, GKSavedGameListener, and GKTurnBasedEventListener protocols.

Then implement the player(_:receivedTurnEventFor:didBecomeActive:) and other `GKTurnBasedEventListener` protocol methods to handle turn-based events that occur throughout a match.
