## Discussion

GameKit sends this turn-based event to the current participant and the participant who initiates the exchange request.

If your game isnâ€™t running or is in the background on participant devices, a notification containing the localized message you provide appears. When the participant taps or clicks the notification, GameKit launches or brings the game to the foreground and then invokes the player(_:receivedExchangeReplies:forCompletedExchange:for:) method.
