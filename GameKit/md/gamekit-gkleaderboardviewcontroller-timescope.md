```

## Discussion

This property determines which tab view is displayed to the player. The default value is GKLeaderboard.TimeScope.allTime, which shows the best score each player has earned. For more information on time scopes, see GKLeaderboard.

If the player changes which tab they view, the `timeScope` property is automatically updated. For example, you can read the `timeScope` property after the view controller is dismissed, and set that value the next time you initialize a new leaderboard view controller.
