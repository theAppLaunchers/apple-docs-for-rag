# Exchanging data between players in real-time games

Send data between players in a real-time multiplayer game.

## Overview

In a multiplayer game, you can exchange game data between players to synchronize the state of the game or to facilitate communication between players. You can begin exchanging data when two or more players join or after all the player slots fill when you start the game. For example, if your game provides text messaging, players can send messages to each other while they wait for other players to join the game. GameKit handles the low-level communication of generic data; you design the structure of your game data, and implement the interface for presenting or entering that data.

### Start exchanging data

When enough players join a multiplayer game, you can begin exchanging data. For example, present an interface for players to send text messages.

If you use the GKMatchmakerViewController class to find players, you can start the game and begin exchanging data when GameKit calls the matchmakerViewController(_:didFind:) delegate method.

To begin exchanging data before the game starts, implement the match(_:player:didChange:) delegate method. Use the match expectedPlayerCount property in the method to determine when you can begin exchanging data. If two or more players join the game, you can begin exchanging data, or if the expected player count is `0`, you can start the game and then exchange data. GameKit also invokes this method when players disconnect or leave the game.

```
// Handle an unknown, connected, or disconnected player state.
func match(_ match: GKMatch,
             player: GKPlayer,
             didChange state: GKPlayerConnectionState) {

    print("Available player slots: \(String(match.expectedPlayerCount))")

    switch state {
        case .connected:
            // Handle connected state.
        case .disconnected:
            // Handle disconnected state.
        default:
            // Handle unknown state.
    }
}
```

To reinvite players whose match state becomes disconnected in a two-player match, implement the match(_:shouldReinviteDisconnectedPlayer:) delegate method to return true.

### Send data to players

GameKit exchanges generic data between players to give you flexibility in designing your game data. You just need to convert your model objects to a `Data` object before you send it. Then, you choose the type of transmission and size of the data depending on the characteristics of your game. You can send data to a subset of players or all players in the game.

Use the send(_:to:dataMode:) or sendData(toAllPlayers:with:) method to send data to one or more players. To guarantee that players receive the data in the order you send it, pass GKMatch.SendDataMode.reliable as the data mode. If the data is small and a delay in transmission invalidates its contents (such as position and velocity in a real-time game), pass GKMatch.SendDataMode.unreliable as the data mode.

The following example shows how to convert a string to a `Data` object and send it as a message from one player to another player.

```
// Send a text message from one player to another.
func sendMessage(content: String){
    do {
        // Send the game data to the other player.
        let data: Data? = content.data(using: .utf8)
        try singlesMatch?.sendData(toAllPlayers: data!, with: GKMatch.SendDataMode.unreliable)
    } catch {
        return
    }
}
```

For large data or many players, you can layer a network topology that performs better over the peer-to-peer topology that GameKit provides. For example, reduce the network traffic by implementing a client-server or ring topology. If you send data only to and from one player, you can reduce the network connections by half.

If you choose a client-server topology, use the chooseBestHostingPlayer(completionHandler:) delegate method to find the player with the best network connection to act as the server. Invoke this method simultaneously in each game instance running on each playerâ€™s device.

### Receive data from players

Finally, you process the data that players receive from other players. For the recipients of the data, implement the match(_:didReceive:fromRemotePlayer:) delegate method to unpack the data sent by other players. For example, if the data contains a text message from another player, convert the `Data` object to a string. To display which player sent the data, use the player parameter.

```
// Receive a message sent from one player to another.
func match(_ match: GKMatch, didReceive data: Data, fromRemotePlayer player: GKPlayer){
    let content = String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)
    // Update the interface from the game data.
}
```
