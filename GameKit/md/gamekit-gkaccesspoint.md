## Mentioned in 

Adding an access point to your game

## Overview

The access point displays a control in a corner of your game that opens a Game Center dashboard when the player taps or clicks it.

Use the shared property to get the shared access point object. GameKit attaches the access point to the window you specify in the parentWindow property, in the corner you specify using the location property. If you donâ€™t specify a parent window, GameKit infers an appropriate location. For the location of the access point on visionOS, see Configure the access point on visionOS.

To display highlights, set the showHighlights property to true. Then set isActive to true to display the access point control.
