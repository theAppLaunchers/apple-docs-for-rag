## Discussion

Before creating an achievement, use the loadAchievements(completionHandler:) method to load the achievements that are in progress. If the achievement you want to report progress on isnâ€™t in the array that GameKit passes to the handler, use this method to initialize the achievement, but only when reporting progress for a participant at the end of a turn-based match. Otherwise, use the init(identifier:) method to initialize the achievement.
