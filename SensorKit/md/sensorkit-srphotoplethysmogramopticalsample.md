## Overview

To get the PPG waveform, use the normalizedReflectance property. Apple Watch uses an arrangement of emitters and photodiodes to measure the PPG waveform.

### Interpret second-generation PPG sensors data

Second-generation optical heart sensors, in Apple Watch 4, 5, and SE models, use green or infrared (IR) LED lights paired with light-sensitive photodiodes. The active photodiodeâ€™s indices show which photodiode or combination of photodiodes the Apple Watch uses.

For the second-generation sensors, the mapping of the optical heart sensor (SE, Series 4 and 5) emitter is:

| Emitter index | LED arrangement      |
|---------------|----------------------|
| 0             | 0, Infrared (940 nm) |
| 1             | 1, Infrared (940 nm) |
| 2             | 2, Green (525 nm)    |
| 3             | 3, Green (525 nm)    |
| 4             | 4, Green (525 nm)    |
| 5             | 5, Green (525 nm)    |

### Interpret third-generation PPG sensors

Third-generation optical heart sensor, in Apple Watch Series 6 and later, plus Apple Watch Ultra and Ultra 2, use an additional red LED with a different arrangement of emitters and photodiodes than the second-generation PPG sensors. The active photodiodes indices show which photodiode or combination of photodiodes the Apple Watch uses.

For the third-generation sensors, the mapping of the optical heart sensor (Series 6, 7, 8, 9, Ultra, and Ultra 2) emitter is:

| Emitter index | LED arrangement      |
|---------------|----------------------|
| 0             | 0, Infrared (850 nm) |
| 1             | 1, Infrared (850 nm) |
| 2             | 2, Infrared (850 nm) |
| 3             | 3, Infrared (850 nm) |
| 4             | 4, Infrared (940 nm) |
| 5             | 5, Red (660 nm)      |
| 6             | 6, Red (660 nm)      |
| 7             | 7, Red (660 nm)      |
| 8             | 8, Red (660 nm)      |
| 9             | 9, Green (525 nm)    |
| 10            | 10, Green (525 nm)   |
| 11            | 11, Green (525 nm)   |
| 12            | 12, Green (525 nm)   |
