## Discussion

Use this property to compute the duration that the user wears their Apple Watch.

The initial value of the offWristDate property is the current date and the onWristDate property is nil. The system changes the value of these properties as follows:

- When the user puts on their Apple Watch, the onWristDate property becomes the current date and the offWristDate property remains the same.

- When the user takes off their Apple Watch, the offWristDate property becomes the current date, and the onWristDate property remains the same.
