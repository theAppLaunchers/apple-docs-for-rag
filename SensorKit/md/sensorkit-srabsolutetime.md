# SRAbsoluteTime

A value that describes when the system records the data.

iOS 14.0+iPadOS 14.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+

``` source
struct SRAbsoluteTime
```

## Discussion

This value tracks monotonically increasing device-specific time, unlike mach_continuous_time, which keeps tracking across reboots.

Although a fetch can query a device other than a phone (such as a paired watch), the framework consistently describes time according to the phone. Any fetch results from a paired watch are in the phoneâ€™s version of SRAbsoluteTime.
