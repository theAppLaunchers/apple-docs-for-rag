# SRDeletionRecord

An object that describes the reason the framework deletes samples.

iOS 14.0+iPadOS 14.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+

``` source
class SRDeletionRecord
```

## Overview

When there are gaps in a recorded sensorâ€™s data, deletion records account for the occasions when the framework deliberately removes the records. A deletion record specifies the time range when records are unavailable (see startTime and endTime), and the reason for removal.

To access deletion records for a particular sensor, create a new reader by applying the `sr_sensorForDeletionRecordsFromSensor()` extension of NSString to the source sensor.

```
let deletionRecordsReader = SRSensorReader(sensor: ambientLightSensor.rawValue.sr_sensorForDeletionRecordsFromSensor())
deletionRecordsReader.delegate = myAmbientLightDeletionRecordsDelegate
```
