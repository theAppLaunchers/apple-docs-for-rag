## Discussion

This property contains the text and input sources the framework records as the user enters text in an app. A text-input session starts when the user raises a keyboard and ends when the keyboard dismisses. However, the framework combines a text-input session that contains fewer than 20 words with the subsequent text-input sessions until reaching a 20-word minimum. The framework separates input modes (inputModes) such that one input mode doesnâ€™t combine with a text-input session of another mode (such as Spanish-Mexico).
