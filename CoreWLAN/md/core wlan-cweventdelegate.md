Protocol

# CWEventDelegate

The interface a Wi-Fi client object uses to notify its delegate about Wi-Fi events.

Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.6+

``` source
protocol CWEventDelegate
```

## Overview

An object that adopts the `CWEventDelegate` protocol and that is assigned as the delegate of a CWWiFiClient object receives notifications of changes on a Wi-Fi interface. Use the startMonitoringEvent(with:) method to indicate to the client the event types for which you want to receive notifications. Use the stopMonitoringEvent(with:) method to stop receiving a particular notification type, or the stopMonitoringAllEvents() method to stop receiving all notifications.
