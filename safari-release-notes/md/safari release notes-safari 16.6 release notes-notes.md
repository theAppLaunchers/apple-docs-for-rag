# Safari 16.6 Release Notes

Released July 24, 2023 — Version 16.6 (18615.3.12)

## Overview

Safari 16.6 is available for macOS Big Sur, macOS Monterey, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16.6, and iOS 16.6.

### CSS

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed using `currentcolor` with `color-mix()`.

- Fixed content at `block-start` edge to have their trimmed margins reflected in the computed style.

- Fixed trimmed `block-end` margins for block containers to be reflected in the computed style in a horizontal writing mode.

- Fixed compression streams to handle large outputs during the flush stage.

- Fixed trimming nested self-collapsing children at `block-end`.

- Fixed the CSS `hypot()` function sometimes returning the result squared.

- Fixed container query length units to use the content box instead of the border box.

- Fixed serializing properties directly in the parent group rule only for the first nested style rule.

### Forms

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed the value not updating on `` and `` elements.

### Web API

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed `putImageData` to draw on the correct canvas.
