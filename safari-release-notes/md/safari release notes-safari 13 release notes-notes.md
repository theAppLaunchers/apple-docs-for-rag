# Safari 13 Release Notes

Released September 19, 2019 — Version 13 (15608.2.11)

## Overview

Safari 13 ships with iOS 13 and macOS 10.15. It’s also available for macOS 10.14.5 and 10.13.6.

### General

#### New Features

- Added Desktop-class Browsing to Safari for iPad. Safari for iPad displays the same desktop websites as Safari for macOS, and provides the same capabilities. In addition it has more keyboard shortcuts, a download manager with background downloads, and support for top productivity websites.

- Added opt-in dark mode support for websites in Safari for iOS.

- Added support for aborting Fetch requests.

### Authentication and Passwords

#### New Features

- Updated Safari to prompt the user to change weak passwords when signing into a website. Requesting a password change uses the well-known URL for changing passwords, enabling websites to specify the page to open for updating a password.

- Added support for FIDO2-compliant USB security keys with the Web Authentication standard in Safari on macOS.

- Added support for Sign in With Apple to Safari and to WKWebView.

### Security and Privacy

#### New Features

- Added a permission API on iOS for DeviceMotionEvent and DeviceOrientationEvent.

- Changed the behavior for third party iframes to prevent them automatically navigating the page.

- Updated Intelligent Tracking Prevention to prevent cross-site tracking through referrer and through link decoration.

- Improved the privacy of local WebRTC data connections with mDNS ICE candidates.

- Increased the security for WebKit sandboxes on iOS and macOS.

### Layout and Rendering

#### New Features

- Added support for one-finger accelerated scrolling to all frames and `overflow:scroll` elements eliminating the need to `set-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`.

- Changed the default behavior on iPad for wide web pages with responsive meta-tags that require horizontal scrolling. Pages are scaled to prevent horizontal scrolling and any text is resized to preserve legibility.

- Added support for CSS conic gradients.

### Performance

#### New Features

- Reduced the initial rendering time for webpages on iOS.

- Added automatic support for Fast Tap to desktop websites on iPad.

- Reduced load time up to 50% for webpages on watchOS.

- Reduced the amount of memory used by JavaScript, including for non-web clients.

- Improved the MotionMark graphics performance benchmark score by 10%.

### Web API

#### New Features

- Added support for the `__Secure-` and `__Host-` cookie prefixes in beta 3.

- Improved iPad hardware keyboard support for websites including focus navigation and scrolling with the arrow keys.

- Added support for the Pointer Events API enabling consistent access to mouse, trackpad, touch, and Apple Pencil events.

- Added support for the Visual Viewport API for adjusting web content to avoid overlays, such as the onscreen keyboard.

- Added support for programmatic paste with user consent to Safari for iOS.

- Updated editing callouts to avoid in-page controls.

- Added intelligent whitespace to editable WebViews and editable areas of webpages.

### Payment Request API

#### New Features

- Added support for Apple Pay on the Web to WKWebView. Note that using script injection APIs, such as WKUserScript or evaluateJavaScript(_:completionHandler:) disables Apple Pay for that view.

### Media

#### New Features

- Added support for the `decodingInfo()` method of the Media Capabilities API for checking supported codecs, efficiently supported codecs, and optional codec features including alpha.

- Added the ability to Safari for macOS to share your screen with others using only web technologies. Plug-ins are no longer required.

- Updated Safari for iPad to support Media Source Extensions.

- Added support for the `navigator.mediaDevices` property of the Media Capture and Streams API to SFSafariViewController.

#### Resolved Issues

- Transparency in video with an alpha channel now works correctly for all supported video formats.

### Safari App Extension API

#### New Features

### Web Inspector and Tools

#### New Features

- Added Safari WebDriver to iOS.

- Added importing and exporting of recorded timeline data.

- Added the CPU Usage Timeline for analyzing and improving the power efficiency of websites.

- Added the Audit tab for running tests against web content including a built-in accessibility audit, importing and exporting results, and creating custom audits.

- Added the Changes sidebar in the Elements tab to track CSS changes in the Styles sidebar.

- Added the Device Settings menu to override developer-related Safari settings when Web Inspector is connected to an iOS device.

- Added a Security tab to the resources view of the Network tab to review certificates and TLS settings.

- Increased the performance of Web Inspector for large sites.

#### Removed Features

- Removed support for WebSQL.

- Removed support for Legacy Safari Extensions.

- Disabled `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch `on iPad. All frames and scrollable overflow areas now use accelerated one-finger scrolling without changing stacking.

### AuthenticationServices Framework
