### CSS

#### New Features

- Added support for additional values for the `font-variant-alternates` property: `annotation(value-name)`, `character-variant(value-name)`, `ornaments(value-name)`, `styleset(value-name)`, `stylistic(value-name)`, `swash(value-name)`, along with the associated `@font-feature-values` at-rule.

- Added support for `last baseline` alignment for Flexbox and Grid.

- Added support for `color-mix()`.

- Added support for Gradient Interpolation Color Spaces.

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed backgrounds with a `fixed` attachment to behave like `scroll` inside transformed elements.

- Fixed calculating inline `min-content` size to include the `aspect-ratio` and add the `min-content` block computation.

- Fixed flexbox cases where border and padding are added twice to the computed min and max sizes.

- Fixed flex base size width calculation to not consider min and max sizes.

- Fixed focus behavior to not take into account scroll margin when checking visibility.

- Fixed layout containment to not propagate forced breaks to the parent.

- Fixed transforms on SVG shapes and groups when the root element size is changed.

- Fixed `text-decoration` location for superscripts and subscripts when the text string contains both regular text and either superscript or subscript.

- Fixed `text-decoration` pixel alignment when the content is truncated.

- Fixed removing the intrinsic margin when specifying the width or height of an `` element.

- Fixed rounding for `rgba()` channels.

- Fixed `font-variant` shorthand parsing to allow the `font-variant-east-asian` property in any position.

- Fixed scroll snapping on a date input with `scroll-margin` applied.

### Rendering
