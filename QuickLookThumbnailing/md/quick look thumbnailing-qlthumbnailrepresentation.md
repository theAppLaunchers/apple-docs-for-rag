## Overview

QuickLook Thumbnailing is a non-UI framework, so your app doesnâ€™t have to link to either UIKit or AppKit. Quicklook Thumbnailing generates a thumbnail as a Core Graphics image object and makes the thumbnail available as the cgImage property. If an app links to AppKit or UIKit, the thumbnail is available through the nsImage or uiImage properties.

For more information on the different types of thumbnails that QLThumbnailGenerator can create, see QLThumbnailGenerator.Request.RepresentationTypes.
