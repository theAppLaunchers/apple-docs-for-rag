Instance Property

# selectedRecords

The selection in the records list. (read-only)

macOS 10.3+

``` source
@MainActor
var selectedRecords: [Any]! { get }
```

## Discussion

The selection is returned as an array of ABGroup or ABPerson objects.

Person records are unified by the people picker for displayâ€”multiple person records that represent the same person are displayed as if there were a single record containing all of the properties. If the user selects such a record, this array includes all of the person records that were unified.
