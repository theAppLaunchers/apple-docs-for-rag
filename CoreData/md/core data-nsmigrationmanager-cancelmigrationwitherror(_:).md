func cancelMigrationWithError(_ error: any Error)
```

## Parameters 

`error`  

An error object that describes the reason why the migration is canceled.

## Discussion

You can invoke this method from anywhere in the migration process to abort the migration. Calling this method causes migrateStore(from:sourceType:options:with:toDestinationURL:destinationType:destinationOptions:) to abort the migration and return `error`â€”you should provide an appropriate error to indicate the reason for the cancellation.
