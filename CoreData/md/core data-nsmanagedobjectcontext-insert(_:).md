``` source
func insert(_ object: NSManagedObject)
```

## Parameters 

`object`  

A managed object.

## Discussion

The managed object (`object`) is registered in the receiver with a temporary global ID. It is assigned a permanent global ID when changes are committed. If the current transaction is rolled back (for example, if the receiver is sent a rollback() message) before a save operation, the object is unregistered from the receiver.
