## Discussion

A managed object context does not post key-value observing notifications when the return value of `updatedObjects` changes. A context does, however, post a NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChange notification when a change is made, and a NSManagedObjectContextWillSave notification and a NSManagedObjectContextDidSave notification before and after changes are committed respectively.
