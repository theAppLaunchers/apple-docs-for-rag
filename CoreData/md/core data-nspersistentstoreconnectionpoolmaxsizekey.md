## Discussion

Values that you specify for this key are of type NSNumber. The connection pool size determines the number of requests a store can handle concurrently, and is a function of how many contexts attempt to access store data at any time. Generally, you donâ€™t set this, and use the default value instead.

The default connection pool size is implementation-dependent and may vary by store type or platform.
