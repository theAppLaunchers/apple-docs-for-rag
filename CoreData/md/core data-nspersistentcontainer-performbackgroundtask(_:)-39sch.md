## Discussion

Each time this method is invoked, the persistent container creates a new NSManagedObjectContext with the concurrencyType set to NSManagedObjectContextConcurrencyType.privateQueueConcurrencyType. The persistent container then executes the passed in block against that newly created context on the contextâ€™s private queue.
