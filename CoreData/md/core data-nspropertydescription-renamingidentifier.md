## Discussion

This is used to resolve naming conflicts between models. When creating an entity mapping between entities in two managed object models, a source entity property and a destination entity property that share the same identifier indicate that a property mapping should be configured to migrate from the source to the destination. If unset, the identifier will return the propertyâ€™s name.
