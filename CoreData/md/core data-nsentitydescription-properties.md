``` source
var properties: [NSPropertyDescription] { get set }
```

## Discussion

The elements in the array are instances of NSAttributeDescription, NSRelationshipDescription, and/or NSFetchedPropertyDescription.

### Special Considerations

Setting the properties raises an exception if the receiverâ€™s model has been used by an object graph manager.
