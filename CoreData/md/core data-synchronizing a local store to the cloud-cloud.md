## Overview

Note

This sample code project is associated with the WWDC22 session 10119: Optimize your use of Core Data and CloudKit .

### Configure the sample code project

Before you run the sample code project in Xcode, do the following:

1.  In Xcode’s Project navigator, select the project, and click the Signing & Capabilities tab.

2.  From the Team pop-up menu, choose your developer team.

3.  In the Bundle Identifier field, enter a new bundle ID for the CoreDataCloudKitDemo target. The bundle identifier for the project has an associated App ID, so you need a unique identifier to create your own App ID. Use a reverse-DNS format for your identifier, as Preparing Your App for Distribution describes.

4.  In the iCloud Capability Section, click the + button to create a new iCloud Container, or click a the checkbox next to an existing container you would like to use.

5.  Select the CoreDataCloudKitDemoUnitTests target and use the Team pop-up menu to choose your developer team.

Xcode automatically generates provisioning profiles as needed. You can now build and run the CoreDataCloudKitDemo app or tests.

### Run the CoreDataCloudKitDemo app

1.  Select the CoreDataCloudKitDemo scheme.

2.  Choose a destination. The CoreDataCloudKitDemo app supports the following destinations:

    - Any iOS simulator

    - Any iOS device

    - My Mac (Mac Catalyst)

### Configuration options

To facilitate testing, the app supports the following configuration options the `AppDelegate` class parses into properties:

- `-CDCKDTesting`

  - Set to `1` to store files in the special directory `TestStores`, so that tests don’t overwrite user data.

- `-CDCKDAllowCloudKitSync`

  - Set to `0` to disable CloudKit sync during testing.

- `com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug`

  - Enable Core Data multithreading assertions to verify all Core Data operations use the correct queue.
