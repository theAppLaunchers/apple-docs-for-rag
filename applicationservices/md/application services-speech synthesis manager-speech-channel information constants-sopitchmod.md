## Discussion

Get or set a speech channelâ€™s pitch modulation.The `speechInfo` parameter isa pointer to a variable of type `Fixed`.Pitch modulation is also expressed as a fixed-point value in therange of 0.000 to 127.000. These values correspond to MIDI notevalues, where 60.000 is equal to middle C on a piano scale. Themost useful speech pitches fall in the range of 40.000 to 55.000.A pitch modulation value of 0.000 corresponds to a monotone in whichall speech is generated at the frequency corresponding to the speech pitch.Given a speech pitch value of 46.000, a pitch modulation of 2.000 wouldmean that the widest possible range of pitches corresponding tothe actual frequency of generated text would be 44.000 to 48.000.

This selector works with both the `GetSpeechInfo` and `SetSpeechInfo` functions.

Note

The change in pitch modulation may not be noticeable until the next sentence or paragraph is spoken.
