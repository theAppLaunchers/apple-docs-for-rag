## Discussion

The `SetSpeechRate` functionadjusts the speech rate on the speech channel specified by the `chan` parameterto the rate specified by the `rate` parameter.As a general rule, speaking rates range from around 150 words perminute to around 220 words per minute. It is important to keep inmind, however, that users will differ greatly in their ability to understandsynthesized speech at a particular rate based upon their level ofexperience listening to the voice and their ability to anticipatethe types of utterances they will encounter.

Note: the new speech rate should be expressed as an integer (nota fixed point decimal number as the data type implies).
