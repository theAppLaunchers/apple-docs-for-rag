Function

# PMPrinterSetOutputResolution(\_:\_:\_:)

Sets the print settings to reflect the specified printer hardware output resolution.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
func PMPrinterSetOutputResolution(
    _ printer: PMPrinter,
    _ printSettings: PMPrintSettings,
    _ resolutionP: UnsafePointer
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`printer`  

The printer whose output resolution you want to change.

`printSettings`  

The print settings object used for the print job.

`resolutionP`  

A pointer to a PMResolution structure that specifies the desired resolution in pixels per inch.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

Some printers allow programmatic control of their hardware output resolution on a print job basis. The hardware resolution is determined by the combination of printer and print settings used for the print job. This function configures the print settings to the closest resolution setting that can be used for the destination print job. Note that not all printers allow control of their resolution setting.

This function is rarely used. Most applications do not set the output resolution but instead use the setting supplied by the user in the Print dialog.
