## Discussion

Get or set the speech channelâ€™s baselinespeech pitch. This selector is intended for use by the Speech SynthesisManager; ordinarily, an application uses the GetSpeechPitch(_:_:) and SetSpeechPitch(_:_:) functions.The `speechInfo` parameteris a pointer to a variable of type `Fixed`.

This selector works with both the `GetSpeechInfo` and `SetSpeechInfo` functions.

Note

The change in speech pitch may not be noticeable until the next sentence or paragraph is spoken.
