func PMPrintSettingsSetJobName(
    _ printSettings: PMPrintSettings,
    _ name: CFString
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`printSettings`  

The print settings object whose job name you want to set.

`name`  

The new name for the print job.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

If you’re using the Print dialog, you should call this function before presenting the dialog. You are strongly encouraged to create a print job name that’s meaningful to the user and use this function to set the name; this produces the best user experience. If you do not specify the print job name, the printing system creates an appropriate job name for you.

If you call this function after initiating a print job, the change is ignored for the current job.
