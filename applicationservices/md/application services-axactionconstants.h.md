# AXActionConstants.h

Many UIElements have a set of actions that they can perform. Actions are designed to be simple. Actions roughly correspond to things you could do with a single click of the mouse on the UIElement. Buttons and menu items, for example, have a single action: push or pick, respectively. A scroll bar has several actions: page up, page down, up one line, down one line.
