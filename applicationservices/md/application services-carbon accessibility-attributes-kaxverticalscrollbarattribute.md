## Discussion

The vertical scroll bar displayed by the user interface element this accessibility object represents. This is a convenience attribute an assistive application can use easily to find the scroll bar without traversing the accessibility hierarchy. This attribute is recommended for all accessibility objects that display a vertical scroll bar.
