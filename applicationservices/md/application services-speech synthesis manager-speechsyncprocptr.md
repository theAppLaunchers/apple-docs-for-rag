# SpeechSyncProcPtr

Defines a pointer to a synchronization callbackfunction that is called when the Speech Synthesis Manager encountersa synchronization command embedded in a text buffer.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
typealias SpeechSyncProcPtr = (SpeechChannel, SRefCon, OSType) -> Void
```

## Parameters 

`chan`  

The speech channel that has finished processing input text.

`refCon`  

The reference constant associated with the speech channel.

`syncMessage`  

The synchronization message passed in the embedded command. Usually, you use this message to distinguish between several different types of synchronization commands, but you can use it any way you wish.

## Discussion

The Speech Synthesis Manager calls a speech channelâ€™s synchronizationcallback function whenever it encounters a synchronization commandembedded in a text buffer. You might use the synchronization callbackfunction to provide a callback not ordinarily provided. For example,you might inset synchronization commands at the end of every sentencein a text buffer, or you might enter synchronization commands afterevery numeric value in the text. However, to synchronize your applicationwith phonemes or words, it makes more sense to use the built-inphoneme and word callback functions, defined in SpeechPhonemeProcPtr.

You can specify a synchronization callback function by passingthe `soSyncCallBack` selector tothe `SetSpeechInfo` functionand embedding a synchronization command within a text buffer passedto the `SpeakText` or `SpeakBuffer` function.
