Function

# PMGetAdjustedPageRect(\_:\_:)

Obtains the imageable area or page rectangle, taking into account orientation, application drawing resolution, and scaling settings.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
func PMGetAdjustedPageRect(
    _ pageFormat: PMPageFormat,
    _ pageRect: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`pageFormat`  

The page format object whose adjusted page rectangle you want to obtain.

`pageRect`  

A pointer to your PMRect structure. On return, the structure contains the current imageable area, in points, taking into account scaling, rotation, and application resolution settings. The page rectangle is the area of the page to which an application can draw. The coordinates for the upper-left corner of the page rectangle are (0,0). See Supporting Printing in Your Carbon Application for more information on page and paper rectangles.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

Before using this function, you must call PMSessionValidatePageFormat(_:_:_:) to ensure that the values for the adjusted page rectangle correctly account for scaling, rotation, and application resolution settings.
