Function

# PMSetFirstPage(\_:\_:\_:)

Sets the default page number of the first page to be printed.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
func PMSetFirstPage(
    _ printSettings: PMPrintSettings,
    _ first: UInt32,
    _ lock: Bool
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`printSettings`  

The print settings object whose first page number you want to set.

`first`  

The page number of the first page to print. This value appears in the From field of the Print dialog.

`lock`  

The lock state of the setting. Locking is not supported at this time.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

Typically, this function isnâ€™t used. In macOS, if you call the function PMSetPageRange(_:_:_:) and then call `PMSetFirstPage` or `PMSetLastPage` using the same page range you specified for `PMSetPageRange`, then the Print dialog shows the From button selected. If you use the constant `kPMPrintAllPages` to set the page range with the function `PMSetPageRange`, then the Print dialog opens with the All button selected regardless of whether you also call `PMSetFirstPage` or `PMSetLastPage`.

If you call this function after initiating a print job, the change is ignored for the current job.
