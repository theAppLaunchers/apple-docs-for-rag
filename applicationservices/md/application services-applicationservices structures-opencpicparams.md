### Instance Properties

var hRes: Fixed

The best horizontal resolution for the picture. A value of 0x0048000 specifies a horizontal resolution of 72 dpi.

var reserved1: Int16

Reserved; set to 0.

var reserved2: Int32

var srcRect: Rect

The optimal bounding rectangle for the resolution indicated by the `hRes` and `vRes` fields. To display a picture at a resolution other than that specified in the `hRes` and `vRes` fields, your application should compute an appropriate destination rectangle by scaling the imageâ€™s width and height by the destination resolution divided by the source resolution.

var vRes: Fixed

The best vertical resolution for the picture. A value of 0x0048000 specifies a vertical resolution of 72 dpi.
