Function

# PMGetLastPage(\_:\_:)

Obtains the number of the last page to be printed.

macOS 10.0+

``` source
func PMGetLastPage(
    _ printSettings: PMPrintSettings,
    _ last: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`printSettings`  

The print settings object whose last page number you want to obtain.

`last`  

A pointer to your `UInt32` variable. On return, the variable contains the page number of the last page to print.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

You use this function to obtain the page number entered by the user in the To field of the Print dialog. If the user did not enter a value, the function returns the value of the previous call to `PMSetLastPage`, if any, or a default value.

You should not look for the constant `kPMPrintAllPages`. That constant is used only with the `PMSetLastPage` and `PMSetPageRange` functions to specify a last page. It is not returned by the `PMGetLastPage` function.
