## Discussion

An array of accessibility objects representing the labels displayed near the control represented by this accessibility object. For example, a slider control might display labels that indicate the range of values the slider can represent. Because these labels are not displayed as part of the sliderâ€™s visual interface, an assistive application does not know they are associated with the slider. By including accessibility objects representing the labels in this attribute, you make this association explicit.
