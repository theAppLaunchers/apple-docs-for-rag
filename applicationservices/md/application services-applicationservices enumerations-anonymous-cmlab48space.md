## Discussion

An L\*a\*b\* color space composed of L\*, a\*, and b\* components whose values are packed with 16 bits per component. The storage size for a color value expressed in this color space is 48 bits. The 16-bit unsigned a\* and b\* channels are interpreted numerically as ranging from -128.0 to approximately 128.0.
