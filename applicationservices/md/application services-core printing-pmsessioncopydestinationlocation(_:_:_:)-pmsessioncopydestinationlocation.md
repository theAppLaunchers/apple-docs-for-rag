Function

# PMSessionCopyDestinationLocation(\_:\_:\_:)

Obtains a destination location for a print job.

macOS 10.1+

``` source
func PMSessionCopyDestinationLocation(
    _ printSession: PMPrintSession,
    _ printSettings: PMPrintSettings,
    _ destLocationP: UnsafeMutablePointer?>
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`printSession`  

The printing session that provides a context for the print job.

`printSettings`  

The print settings for the print job whose destination location you want to obtain.

`destLocationP`  

A pointer to your CFURL variable. On return, the variable refers to a Core Foundation URL that specifies the destination location of the print job. You are responsible for releasing the URL. If `NULL` is returned and the function executes without error (result code is `noErr`), the print job uses the default destination location for the current destination type. If an error occurs, the variable is set to `NULL`.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

You must call this function between the creation and release of a printing session. See the function PMCreateSession(_:).

Some destination types define a specific kind of destination location for a print job. For example, the destination type `kPMDestinationFile` uses a file system URL to specify where a new file should be created for the print jobâ€™s output.
