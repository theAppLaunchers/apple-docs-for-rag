## Discussion

This mask provides access to bits 16 through 31 of the `flags` field, which are available for a color management system (CMS) vendor, such as ColorSync. ColorSyncâ€™s default CMM uses bits 16 through 19 to provide hints for color matching, as described in the following three mask definitions. Other CMM vendors should follow the same conventions.
