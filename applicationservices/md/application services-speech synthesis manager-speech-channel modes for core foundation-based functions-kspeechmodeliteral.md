Global Variable

# kSpeechModeLiteral

When the speech channel is in text-processing mode, indicates that characters and digits are spoken literally (for example, “cat” is spoken as “C-A-T” and “12” is spoken as "one, two"). Use this value with kSpeechCharacterModeProperty and kSpeechNumberModeProperty.
