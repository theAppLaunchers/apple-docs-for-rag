```

## Parameters 

`numVoices`  

On exit, a pointer to the number of voices that the application can use.

## Return Value

A resultcode. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

The `CountVoices` functionreturns, in the `numVoices` parameter,the number of voices available. The application can then use thisinformation to call the `GetIndVoice` functionto obtain voice specification structures for one or more of thevoices.

Each time `CountVoices` iscalled, the Speech Synthesis Manager searches for new voices.
