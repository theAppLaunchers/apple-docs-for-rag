# SpeechErrorCFProcPtr

Defines a pointer to an error callback function that handles syntax errors within commands embedded in a `CFString` object being processed by the Speech Synthesis Manager.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
typealias SpeechErrorCFProcPtr = (SpeechChannel, SRefCon, CFError) -> Void
```

## Parameters 

`chan`  

The speech channel that has finished processing input text.

`refCon`  

The reference constant associated with the speech channel.

`theError`  

The error that occurred in processing an embedded command.

## Discussion

An error callback function defined by the `SpeechErrorCFProcPtr` is the Core Foundation-based equivalent of an error callback function defined by SpeechErrorProcPtr. The Speech Synthesis Manager calls a speech channelâ€™s error callback function whenever it encounters a syntax error within a command embedded in a `CFString` object it is processing. This can be useful during application debugging, to detect problems with commands that you have embedded in strings that your application speaks. It can also be useful if your application allows users to embed commands within strings. Your application might display an alert indicating that the Speech Synthesis Manager encountered a problem in processing an embedded command.

Ordinarily, the error information that the Speech Synthesis Manager provides the error callback function should be sufficient. However, if your application needs information about errors that occurred before the error callback function was enabled, the application (including the error callback function) can call the CopySpeechProperty(_:_:_:) function with the `kSpeechErrorsProperty` property.

You can specify an error callback function by passing the `kSpeechErrorCFCallback` property to the SetSpeechProperty(_:_:_:) function.
