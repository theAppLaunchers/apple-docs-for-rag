Function

# PMSessionBeginCGDocumentNoDialog(\_:\_:\_:)

Begins a print job that draws into a Quartz graphics context and suppresses the printing status dialog.

macOS 10.4+

``` source
func PMSessionBeginCGDocumentNoDialog(
    _ printSession: PMPrintSession,
    _ printSettings: PMPrintSettings,
    _ pageFormat: PMPageFormat
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`printSession`  

The printing session that provides a context for the new print job.

`printSettings`  

The print settings to use for the new print job.

`pageFormat`  

The page format to use for the new print job.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

This function starts a print job that draws directly into a Quartz graphics context and should be called within your applicationâ€™s print loop. This function is similar to the function `PMSessionBeginCGDocument` except that the printing status dialog is suppressed.

You must call `PMSessionBeginCGDocumentNoDialog` between the creation and release of a printing session. See the function PMCreateSession(_:). If you present a printing dialog before you call `PMSessionBeginCGDocumentNoDialog`, when calling this function you should use the same PMPrintSession object you used to present the dialog.

Before you call `PMSessionBeginCGDocumentNoDialog`, you should call PMSessionValidatePrintSettings(_:_:_:) and PMSessionValidatePageFormat(_:_:_:) to make sure the specified print settings and page format objects are updated and valid. After you call `PMSessionBeginCGDocumentNoDialog`, if you call a function that changes the specified print settings or page format object, the change is ignored for the current print job.

During the print job, the caller cannot obtain a Quickdraw graphics port for the printing session but can only obtain a Quartz graphics context. As a result, this function should be used in conjunction with PMSessionGetCGGraphicsContext(_:_:) instead of PMSessionGetGraphicsContext.

This function must be called before its corresponding `End` function (PMSessionEndDocumentNoDialog(_:)). If the function `PMSessionBeginCGDocumentNoDialog` returns `noErr`, you must later call the `End` function, even if errors occur within the scope of the `Begin` and `End` functions.

The printing system automatically handles printing multiple copies. Your application does not need to perform any tasks other than specifying the number of copies in the printing session.
