# SpeechWordCFProcPtr

Defines a pointer to a Core Foundation-based word callback function that is called by the Speech Synthesis Manager before it pronounces a word.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
typealias SpeechWordCFProcPtr = (SpeechChannel, SRefCon, CFString, CFRange) -> Void
```

## Parameters 

`chan`  

The speech channel that has finished processing input text.

`refCon`  

The reference constant associated with the speech channel.

`aString`  

A string containing the original text passed to the speech synthesizer in the SpeakCFString(_:_:_:) call.

`wordRange`  

The range of characters in `aString` that corresponds to the word.

## Discussion

A word callback function defined by the `SpeechWordCFProcPtr` is the Core Foundation-based equivalent of a word callback function defined by SpeechWordProcPtr. The Speech Synthesis Manager calls a speech channelâ€™s word callback function just before it pronounces a word. You might use such a callback function, for example, to highlight the word about to be spoken in a window.

You can specify a word callback function by passing the `kSpeechWordCFCallBack` property to theSetSpeechProperty(_:_:_:) function.
