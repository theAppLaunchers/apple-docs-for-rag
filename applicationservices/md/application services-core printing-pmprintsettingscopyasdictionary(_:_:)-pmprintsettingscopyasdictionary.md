Function

# PMPrintSettingsCopyAsDictionary(\_:\_:)

Creates a dictionary that contains the settings in a print settings object.

macOS 10.5+

``` source
func PMPrintSettingsCopyAsDictionary(
    _ printSettings: PMPrintSettings,
    _ settingsDictionary: UnsafeMutablePointer?>
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`printSettings`  

The print settings object with the desired settings.

`settingsDictionary`  

A pointer to your CFDictionary variable. On return, the variable refers to a Core Foundation dictionary that contains the settings in the specified print settings object. Some of the keys in this dictionary are currently defined in `PMTicket.h`; other keys are user-defined. You are responsible for releasing the dictionary. If an error occurs, the variable is set to `NULL`.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

Most developers have no need to use this function. However, one way this function might be useful would be to enumerate all the entries in a print settings object for inspection.
