## Discussion

The value associated with this accessibility object (for example, a scroller value). The value of an accessibility object is user-modifiable and represents the setting of the associated user interface element, such as the contents of an editable text field or the position of a scroller. This attribute is required if an accessibility objectâ€™s value state conveys information to the user or if the user can define the value of the object.
