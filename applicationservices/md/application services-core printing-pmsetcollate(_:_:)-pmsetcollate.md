Function

# PMSetCollate(\_:\_:)

Specifies whether the job collate option is selected.

macOS 10.2+

``` source
func PMSetCollate(
    _ printSettings: PMPrintSettings,
    _ collate: Bool
) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters 

`printSettings`  

The print settings object whose job collate option you want to set.

`collate`  

If `true`, the job collate option is selected; if `false` the option is not selected.

## Return Value

A result code. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

The Collated checkbox is displayed in the Copies & Pages pane of the Print dialog. This option determines how printed material is organized. For example, if you have a document that is three pages long and you are printing multiple copies with the Collated option selected, the job prints pages 1, 2, and 3 in that order and then repeats. However, if the Collated option is not selected and youâ€™re printing multiple copies of those same three pages, the job prints copies of page 1, then copies of page 2, and finally copies of page 3.

If you call this function after initiating a print job, the change is ignored for the current job.
