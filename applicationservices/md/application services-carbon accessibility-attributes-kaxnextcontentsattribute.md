## Discussion

The group of accessibility objects representing the elements on one side of a splitter bar. (Which side of the splitter bar is considered “next” is determined by the value of the splitter bar’s orientation attribute.) This attribute is recommended for an accessibility object that represents the splitter bar in a split view.
