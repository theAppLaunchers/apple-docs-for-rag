Gets a voice specification structure for a voice bypassing an index to the `GetIndVoice` function.

macOS 10.0â€“13.0Deprecated

``` source
func GetIndVoice(
    _ index: Int16,
    _ voice: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OSErr
```

## Parameters 

`index`  

The index of the voice for which to obtain a voice specification structure. This number must range from `1` to the total number of voices, as returned by the `CountVoices` function.

`voice`  

A pointer to the voice specification structure whose fields are to be filled in.

## Return Value

A resultcode. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

The `GetIndVoice` functionreturns, in the voice specification structure pointed to by the `voice` parameter,a specification of the voice whose index is provided in the `index` parameter.Your application should make no assumptions about the order in whichvoices are indexed.

Your application should not add, remove, or modify a voiceand then call the `GetIndVoice` functionwith an index value other than `1`. To allow the Speech SynthesisManager to update its information about voices, your applicationshould always either call the `CountVoices` functionor call the `GetIndVoice` functionwith an index value of `1` after adding, removing, or modifying avoice or after a time at which the user might have done so.

If you specify an index value beyond the number of availablevoices, the `GetIndVoice` functionreturns a `voiceNotFound` error.
