## Discussion

The subrole of this accessibility object (for example, `AXCloseButton`). The subrole provides additional information about the accessibility object to an assistive application. This string is for identification purposes only and does not need to be localized. This attribute is necessary only for an accessibility object whose `AXRole` attribute does not adequately describe its meaning.
