## Discussion

Does not interrupt current speech. The `kNoSpeechInterrupt` flagbit is used to control the behavior of `SpeakBuffer` whencalled on a speech channel that is still busy. When the flag bitis not set, `SpeakBuffer` behavessimilarly to `SpeakString` and `SpeakText`.Any speech currently being produced on the specified speech channelis immediately interrupted, and then the new text buffer is spoken.When the `kNoSpeechInterrupt` flagbit is set, however, a request to speak on a channel that is stillbusy processing a prior text buffer will result in an error. Thenew buffer is ignored and the error `synthNotReady` isreturned. If the prior text buffer has been fully processed, thenew buffer is spoken normally. One way of achieving continuous speech without using callback functions is to continually call `SpeakBuffer` with the `kNoSpeechInterrupt` flagbit set until the function returns `noErr`.The function will then execute as soon as the first text bufferhas been processed.
