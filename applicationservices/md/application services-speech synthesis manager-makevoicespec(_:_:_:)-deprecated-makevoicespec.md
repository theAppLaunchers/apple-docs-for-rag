macOS 10.0â€“13.0Deprecated

``` source
func MakeVoiceSpec(
    _ creator: OSType,
    _ id: OSType,
    _ voice: UnsafeMutablePointer
) -> OSErr
```

## Parameters 

`creator`  

The ID of the synthesizer that your application requires.

`id`  

The ID of the voice on the synthesizer specified by the `creator` parameter.

`voice`  

A pointer to the voice specification structure whose fields are to be filled in.

## Return Value

A resultcode. See Result Codes.

## Discussion

A voice specification structure is a unique voice ID usedby the Speech Synthesis Manager. Most voice management functionsexpect to be passed a pointer to a voice specification structure.When you already know the creator and ID for a voice, you shoulduse the `MakeVoiceSpec` functionto create such a structure rather than filling in the fields ofone directly. On exit, the voice specification structure pointedto by the `voice` parameter containsthe appropriate values. You should never set the fields of sucha structure directly.
