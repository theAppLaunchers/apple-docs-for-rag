func CFBundleOpenBundleResourceFiles(
    _ bundle: CFBundle!,
    _ refNum: UnsafeMutablePointer!,
    _ localizedRefNum: UnsafeMutablePointer!
) -> Int32
```

Deprecated

The Carbon Resource Manager is deprecated. This should only be used to access Resource Manager-style resources in old bundles.

## Parameters 

`bundle`  

The bundle whose resource map you want to open.

`refNum`  

On return, the reference number of the non-localized resource map.

`localizedRefNum`  

On return, the reference number of the localized resource map.

## Return Value

An error code. The function returns `0` (`noErr`) if successful. If the bundle contains more than one resource file, the function returns an error code only if none was opened. The most common error is `resFNotFound`, but the function may also pass through other errors returned from the Resource Manager.
