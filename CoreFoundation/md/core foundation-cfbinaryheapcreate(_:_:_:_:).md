``` source
func CFBinaryHeapCreate(
    _ allocator: CFAllocator!,
    _ capacity: CFIndex,
    _ callBacks: UnsafePointer!,
    _ compareContext: UnsafePointer!
) -> CFBinaryHeap!
```

## Parameters 

`allocator`  

The allocator to use to allocate memory for the new object. Pass `NULL` or kCFAllocatorDefault to use the current default allocator.

`capacity`  

The maximum number of values that can be contained by the binary heap. The binary heap starts empty and can grow to this number of values. If this parameter is `0`, the binary heapâ€™s maximum capacity is limited only by memory.

`callBacks`  

A pointer to a CFBinaryHeapCallBacks structure initialized with the callbacks that operate on the values placed into the binary heap. If the binary heap will be holding `CFString` objects, pass the kCFStringBinaryHeapCallBacks constant. This functions makes a copy of the contents of the callbacks structure, so that a pointer to a structure on the stack can be passed in, or can be reused for multiple binary heap creations. This callbacks parameter may not be `NULL`.

`compareContext`  

Not used. Pass `NULL`.

## Return Value

A new `CFBinaryHeap` object. Ownership follows the The Create Rule.
