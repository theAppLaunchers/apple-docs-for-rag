``` source
func CFTreeApplyFunctionToChildren(
    _ tree: CFTree!,
    _ applier: ((UnsafeRawPointer?, UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Void)!,
    _ context: UnsafeMutableRawPointer!
)
```

## Parameters 

`tree`  

The tree to operate upon.

`applier`  

The callback function to call once for each child in `tree`. The function must be able to apply to all the values in the tree.

`context`  

A pointer-sized program-defined value that is passed to the applier function, but is otherwise unused by this function.

## Discussion

Note that the applier only operates one level deepâ€”it does not operate on descendants further removed than the immediate children of a tree. If the tree is mutable, it is unsafe for the applied function to change the contents of the tree.
