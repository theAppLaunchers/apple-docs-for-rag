``` source
func CFReadStreamGetBuffer(
    _ stream: CFReadStream!,
    _ maxBytesToRead: CFIndex,
    _ numBytesRead: UnsafeMutablePointer!
) -> UnsafePointer!
```

## Parameters 

`stream`  

The stream to examine.

`maxBytesToRead`  

The maximum number of bytes to read. If greater than `0`, `maxBytesToRead` limits the number of bytes read; if `0` or less, all available bytes are read.

`numBytesRead`  

On return, contains the length of returned buffer. If `stream` is not open or has encountered an error, `numBytesRead` is set to `-1`.

## Return Value

A pointer to the internal buffer of unread data for `stream`, if possible; `NULL` otherwise. The buffer is good only until the next stream operation called on the stream. You should neither change the contents of the returned buffer nor attempt to deallocate the buffer; it is still owned by the stream. The bytes returned in the buffer are considered read from the stream.
