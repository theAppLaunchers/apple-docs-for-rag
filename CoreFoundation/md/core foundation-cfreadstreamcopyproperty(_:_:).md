``` source
func CFReadStreamCopyProperty(
    _ stream: CFReadStream!,
    _ propertyName: CFStreamPropertyKey!
) -> CFTypeRef!
```

## Parameters 

`stream`  

The stream to examine.

`propertyName`  

The name of the stream property to obtain. The available properties for standard Core Foundation streams are listed in CFStream.

## Return Value

The value of the property `propertyName`. Ownership follows the The Create Rule.

## Discussion

Each type of stream can define a set of properties that either describe or configure individual streams. A property can be any information about a stream, other than the actual data the stream handles. Examples include the headers from an HTTP transmission, the expected number of bytes, file permission information, and so on. Use CFReadStreamSetProperty(_:_:_:) to modify the value of a property, although some properties are read-only.
