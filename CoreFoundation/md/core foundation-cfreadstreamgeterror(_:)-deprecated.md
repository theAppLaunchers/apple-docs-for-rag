``` source
func CFReadStreamGetError(_ stream: CFReadStream!) -> CFStreamError
```

Deprecated

Use CFReadStreamCopyError(_:) instead.

## Parameters 

`stream`  

The stream to examine.

## Return Value

The error status of `stream` returned in a CFStreamError structure.

## Discussion

The error field is `0` if no error has occurred. If the error field is not `0`, the `domain` field contains a code that identifies the domain in which the value of the `error` field should be interpreted.
