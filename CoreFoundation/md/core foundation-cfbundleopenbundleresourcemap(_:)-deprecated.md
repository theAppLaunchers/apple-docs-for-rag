Deprecated

The Carbon Resource Manager is deprecated. This should only be used to access Resource Manager-style resources in old bundles.

## Parameters 

`bundle`  

The bundle whose resource map you want to open.

## Return Value

A distinct reference number for the resource map.

## Discussion

Creates and makes current a single read-only resource map containing the non-localized and localized resource files. If this function is called multiple times, it opens the files multiple times and returns distinct reference numbers for each. Use CFBundleCloseBundleResourceMap(_:_:) to close a resource map.
