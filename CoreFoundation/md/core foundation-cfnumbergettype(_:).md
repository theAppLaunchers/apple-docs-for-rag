func CFNumberGetType(_ number: CFNumber!) -> CFNumberType
```

## Parameters 

`number`  

The CFNumber object to examine.

## Return Value

A constant that indicates the data type of the value contained in `number`. See CFNumberType for a list of possible values.

## Discussion

The type specified in the call to CFNumberCreate(_:_:_:) is not necessarily preserved when a new CFNumber object is createdâ€”it uses whatever internal storage type the creation function deems appropriate.
