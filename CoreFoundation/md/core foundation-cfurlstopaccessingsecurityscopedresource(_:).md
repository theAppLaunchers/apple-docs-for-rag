``` source
func CFURLStopAccessingSecurityScopedResource(_ url: CFURL!)
```

## Parameters 

`url`  

The security-scoped URL that points to the file-system resource you want to stop accessing.

## Discussion

When you no longer need access to a file or directory pointed to by a security-scoped URL, such as one returned by resolving a security-scoped bookmark, call this function (or its Cocoa equivalent, stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()) on the URL.

Warning

You must balance every call to the CFURLStartAccessingSecurityScopedResource(_:) method with a corresponding call to the CFURLStopAccessingSecurityScopedResource(_:)Â method. If you fail to relinquish your access when you no longer need a file-system resource, your app leaks kernel resources. If sufficient kernel resources are leaked, your app loses its ability to add file-system locations to its sandbox, such as via Powerbox or security-scoped bookmarks, until relaunched.

Version note

Security-scoped bookmarks are not available in versions of macOS prior to OS X v10.7.3.
