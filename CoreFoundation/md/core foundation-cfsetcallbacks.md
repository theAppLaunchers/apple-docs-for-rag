## Topics

### Initializers

init()

init(version: CFIndex, retain: CFSetRetainCallBack!, release: CFSetReleaseCallBack!, copyDescription: CFSetCopyDescriptionCallBack!, equal: CFSetEqualCallBack!, hash: CFSetHashCallBack!)

### Instance Properties

var copyDescription: CFSetCopyDescriptionCallBack!

The callback used to create a descriptive string representation of each value in the collection. If `NULL`, the collection will create a simple description of each value. See CFSetCopyDescriptionCallBack for a description of this callback.

var equal: CFSetEqualCallBack!

The callback used to compare values in the collection for equality for some operations. If `NULL`, the collection will use pointer equality to compare values in the collection. See CFSetEqualCallBack for a description of this callback.

var hash: CFSetHashCallBack!

The callback used to compute a hash code for values in a collection. If `NULL`, the collection computes a hash code by converting the pointer value to an integer. See CFSetHashCallBack for a description of this callback.

var release: CFSetReleaseCallBack!

The callback used to release values as they are removed from the collection. If `NULL`, values are not released. See CFSetReleaseCallBack for a description of this callback.

var retain: CFSetRetainCallBack!

The callback used to retain each value as they are added to the collection. If `NULL`, values are not retained. See CFSetRetainCallBack for a descriptions of this functionâ€™s parameters.

var version: CFIndex

The version number of this structure. If not one of the defined version numbers for this opaque type, the behavior is undefined. The current version of this structure is `0`.
