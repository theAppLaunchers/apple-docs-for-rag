# Error Subdomains

Subdomains used to determine how to interpret an error in the `kCFStreamErrorDomainSOCKS` domain.

## Overview

Error codes in the `kCFStreamErrorDomainSOCKS` domain can come from multiple parts of the protocol stack, many of which define their own error values as part of outside specifications such as the HTTP specification.

To avoid confusion from conflicting error numbers, error codes in the `kCFStreamErrorDomainSOCKS` domain contain two parts: a subdomain, which tells which part of the protocol stack generated the error, and the error code itself.

Calling CFSocketStreamSOCKSGetErrorSubdomain(_:) returns an identifier that tells which layer of the protocol stack produced the error. This list of constants contains the possible values that this function will return.

Calling CFSocketStreamSOCKSGetError(_:) returns the actual error code that the subdomain describes.

## Topics

### Constants

var kCFStreamErrorSOCKSSubDomainNone: Int { get }

var kCFStreamErrorSOCKSSubDomainVersionCode: Int { get }

var kCFStreamErrorSOCKS4SubDomainResponse: Int { get }

The SOCKS4 status code returned by the server.

var kCFStreamErrorSOCKS5SubDomainUserPass: Int { get }

The status code that the server returned during authentication.

var kCFStreamErrorSOCKS5SubDomainMethod: Int { get }

The serverâ€™s desired negotiation method.

var kCFStreamErrorSOCKS5SubDomainResponse: Int { get }

The response code that the server returned in reply to the connection request.
