typealias CFXMLTree = CFTree
```

## Overview

A CFXMLTree object is simply a CFTree object whose context data is known to be a CFXMLNode object. CFXMLTree is derived from CFTreeâ€”you can pass CFXMLTree objects in all the CFTree functions. As such, a CFXMLTree object can be used to represent an entire XML document; the CFTree object provides the tree structure of the document, while the CFXMLNode objects identify and describe the nodes of the tree. An XML document can be parsed to a CFXMLTree object, and a CFXMLTree object can generate the data for the equivalent XML document. This opaque type is expected to be used in conjunction with CFXMLParser and CFXMLNode objects.
