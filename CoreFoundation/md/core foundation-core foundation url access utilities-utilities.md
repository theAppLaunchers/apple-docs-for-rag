# Core Foundation URL Access Utilities

## Overview

Core Foundation URL Access Utilities give you convenient system-independent methods of creating, reading, updating, or deleting a URL resource.

Given a CFURL object that holds either a file or http URL, you can read the resourceâ€™s data with the CFURLCreateDataAndPropertiesFromResource(_:_:_:_:_:_:) function. You can write data to the URL resource, possibly creating a new file, with the CFURLWriteDataAndPropertiesToResource(_:_:_:_:) function. Finally, you can destroy, or delete, the resource pointed to by the URL with the CFURLDestroyResource(_:_:) function.
