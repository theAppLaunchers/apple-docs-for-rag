## Topics

### Creating a user identity

init(from: any Decoder) throws

Creates a new instance by decoding from the given decoder.

init(value: String)

Initializes a `StringUserIdentity` with the given string value.

### Inspecting an identity

var stringRepresentation: String

String representation of this user identity for display or debugging purposes.

var typeID: String

A unique type identifier for this user identity.

static var typeID: String

A unique type identifier for this user identity.

var value: String

The value of the string to contain in this user identity.

### Operators

static func == (StringUserIdentity, StringUserIdentity) -> Bool

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

### Instance Properties

var hashValue: Int

The hash value.

### Instance Methods

func encode(to: any Encoder) throws

Encodes this value into the given encoder.

func hash(into: inout Hasher)

Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.

### Identity

protocol UserIdentity

Types conforming to this protocol can act as user identities for editors of a document.

struct AnonymousUserIdentity

A user identity for unknown editors.

struct AnyUserIdentity

A user identity that performs type erasure by wrapping another user identity.

class UserIdentityTypeRegistry

A registry for user identity types. Assignable documents and document elements store user identity data as `Data` objects. In order for that data to be deserialized, the type to deserialize it as needs to be known to UserIdentityTypeRegistry. Without registration of the user identity, custom types wonâ€™t be deserializable.

enum UserIdentityFactory

A type that contains helpers for creating user identity objects.
