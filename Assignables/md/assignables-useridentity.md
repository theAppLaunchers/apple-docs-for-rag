## Topics

### Inspecting an identity

var stringRepresentation: String

String representation of this user identity for display or debugging purposes.

**Required**

var typeID: String

A unique type identifier for this user identity.

**Required**

### Setting the scope

func scope&lt;R>(() throws -> R) rethrows -> R

Sets the user identity for document-related operations that occur within the closure passed in.

func scope&lt;R>(() async throws -> R) async rethrows -> R

Sets the user identity for document-related operations that occur within the async closure passed in.

### Getting a type eraser

func eraseToAnyUserIdentity() -> AnyUserIdentity

Wraps this user identity with a type eraser.

**Required** Default implementation provided.

typealias As

An alias for UserIdentityFactory for convenience.

## See Also

### Identity

struct AnonymousUserIdentity

A user identity for unknown editors.

struct AnyUserIdentity

A user identity that performs type erasure by wrapping another user identity.

struct StringUserIdentity

A user identity defined by a string.

class UserIdentityTypeRegistry

A registry for user identity types. Assignable documents and document elements store user identity data as `Data` objects. In order for that data to be deserialized, the type to deserialize it as needs to be known to UserIdentityTypeRegistry. Without registration of the user identity, custom types wonâ€™t be deserializable.

enum UserIdentityFactory

A type that contains helpers for creating user identity objects.
