``` source
nonisolated
func contentShape(
    _ kind: ContentShapeKinds,
    _ shape: S,
    eoFill: Bool = false
) -> some View where S : Shape
```

## Parameters 

`kind`  

The kinds to apply to this content shape.

`shape`  

The shape to use.

`eoFill`  

A Boolean that indicates whether the shape is interpreted with the even-odd winding number rule.

## Return Value

A view that uses the given shape for the specified kind.

## Discussion

The content shape has a variety of uses. You can control the kind of the content shape by specifying one in `kind`. The following example sets the focus ring shape of the view, without affecting its shape for hit-testing:

```
MyFocusableView()
    .contentShape(.focusEffect, Circle())
```

You can apply multiple kinds of content shapes to the same view. For example, apply a `ContentShapeKinds/interaction` shape and `ContentShapeKinds/focusEffect` shape together to set both the hit-testing shape and focus ring shape on a view.

## Context Menu &amp; Drag Previews

You can control the preview shown by the system for context menus or drags using the relevant content shape kind, like `ContentShapeKinds/dragPreview` and `ContentShapeKinds/contextMenuPreview`.

The following example creates a `VStack` of an `Image` and `Text` that has a context menu with a custom content shape:

```
VStack {
    Image("turtlerock")
        .contentShape(.contextMenuPreview,
                      RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10))
    Text("Turtle Rock")
}
.contextMenu {
    Button {
        // Add this item to a list of favorites.
    } label: {
        Label("Add to Favorites", systemImage: "heart")
    }
}
```

When someone activates the context menu with an action like touch and hold in iOS or iPadOS, the system uses the `Image` as the preview for the context menu, applying the requested corner radius.

The content shape also supports applying modifiers such as `InsettableShape/inset(by:)` to add padding.

Note

Similar to `ContentShapeKinds/focusEffect`, the `ContentShapeKinds/contextMenuPreview` and `ContentShapeKinds/dragPreview` content shapes do not impact the hit-testing shape. In this example, someone can touch and hold anywhere on the `VStack` to activate the menu. If you only want the `Image` to activate the menu, apply `View/contextMenu(menuItems:)` to the `Image` instead.
