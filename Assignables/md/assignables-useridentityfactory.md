### Identity

protocol UserIdentity

Types conforming to this protocol can act as user identities for editors of a document.

struct AnonymousUserIdentity

A user identity for unknown editors.

struct AnyUserIdentity

A user identity that performs type erasure by wrapping another user identity.

struct StringUserIdentity

A user identity defined by a string.

class UserIdentityTypeRegistry

A registry for user identity types. Assignable documents and document elements store user identity data as `Data` objects. In order for that data to be deserialized, the type to deserialize it as needs to be known to UserIdentityTypeRegistry. Without registration of the user identity, custom types wonâ€™t be deserializable.
