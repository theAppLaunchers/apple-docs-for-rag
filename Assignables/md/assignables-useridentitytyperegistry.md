# UserIdentityTypeRegistry

A registry for user identity types. Assignable documents and document elements store user identity data as `Data` objects. In order for that data to be deserialized, the type to deserialize it as needs to be known to UserIdentityTypeRegistry. Without registration of the user identity, custom types wonâ€™t be deserializable.
